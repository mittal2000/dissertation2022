Instead of physical displays, the Republican presidential nominee has stuck to verbal ones ― bragging about his penis, launching personal attacks and resorting to racist and sexist insults.Trump is set to debate his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, on Sept. 26. When it happens, Goodall told The Atlantic she’ll be thinking of “Mike,” a chimpanzee she studied that displayed dominance by kicking kerosene cans, creating a racket that sent would-be challengers fleeing. Unsurprisingly, Trump has already boasted that he will come out on top, telling The New York Times “I know how to handle Hillary.”Whether his strategy includes childish tidbits has yet to be seen. Tony Schwartz, co-author of Trump’s book The Art of the Deal, however, bets it will. “Trump has severe attention problems and simply cannot take in complex information — he will be unable to practice for these debates,” Schwartz told the Times. “Trump will bring nothing but his bluster to the debates. He’ll use sixth-grade language, he will repeat himself many times, he won’t complete sentences, and he won’t say anything of substance.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
3,HEALTHY LIVING,The Stage IV Cancer Roller Coaster,"Deborah J. Cornwall, ContributorAuthor, 'Things I Wish I’d Known: Cancer Caregivers Speak Out'...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-stage-iv-cancer-roller-coaster_us_57df019ae4b053b1ccf29dd3,"When diagnosed with cancer, you hope for a boring, run-of-the-mill, highly curable one. Yet many diagnoses pose both scientific",2016-09-18,2016-07-29-1469800099-6785349-KathleenStrosser2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-07-29-1469800099-6785349-KathleenStrosser2-thumb.jpg,"When diagnosed with cancer, you hope for a boring, run-of-the-mill, highly curable one. Yet many diagnoses pose both scientific mysteries for clinicians and personal terror for their patients.Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is one such devastating form of cancer. It develops fast in the lymphatic system (a vital part of the immune system), usually manifesting in the form of breast skin thickening and dimpling, red hot inflammation, and dramatic swelling. Typically, there’s no discrete lump and no means of detection until these physical indicators of a Stage III or IV (metastatic and viewed as terminal) diagnosis.Mortality rates are stunning: Only 40 percent of patients survive as long as five years; life expectancy averages 57 months for Stage III patients and 21 months for Stage IV patients. The disease is estimated to constitute roughly 2-6 percent of breast cancer diagnoses but 10 percent of breast cancer deaths. Three significant reasons for the mortality rate are fast metastasis through the lymph system, inherent chemotherapy resistance, and the lack of treatments specifically tailored for this cancer type. Current treatments are brutal, including mastectomies to remove both breast tissue and affected skin, chemotherapy, and aggressive full-chest-wall radiation.The Fifth International Inflammatory Breast Cancer Conference (July 9-10, 2016) conducted in Boston by the Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, attracted both global clinical and research experts and patient advocates. Because so little dedicated IBC research is underway, presentations included epidemiological data, top clinicians’ experiential learnings, and metastasis research for other cancers. Even though IBC is the rarest, most lethal, and often most variable type of breast cancer, Dr. Kelly Hirko, epidemiologist from Michigan State University’s School of Community Medicine, says that over 6,200 new diagnoses are expected in 2016, almost as many as new cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).IBC patients (most of whom have advanced disease) often bond through online support. During and after treatment, they experience sustained grief every day, both in the loss of support-group friends and in the impact that grueling treatments (chemotherapy, surgery, and aggressive radiation) have on their bodies and physical capabilities.Kate Strosser, a former professor who is fighting her own metastatic Stage IV IBC, described living with such extended grief:The tears come again, and I know it will not be the last time. Grieving never ends for those of us who inhabit metastatic cancer-land. Joy and happiness may visit, but sadness is a permanent resident. We become close with our Stage IV neighbors for support, encouragement, and information. We share the good, the bad, and the ugly every day. One needs to vent, so her anger leaps from her written words. Another needs to whine, frustrated with the medical system or insurance company idiocy. Still others cry, sharing both their physical and emotional pain. We are told that we cannot be cured. Yet we jump into aggressive treatment anyway, wanting to destroy the cells, burn the tumors, cut off the offending body parts that house a vicious killer. Our sisters provide dark humor, words of encouragement to live fully, and empathy for the hair that never grows back. We exchange methods for lessening side effects, buy wigs, and try to get comfortable with prosthetics or flat chests. And the kindness of our sisters soothes our nerves and lifts us when we are tired, a true comfort during yet another round of scans. Meanwhile, the treatments needed to save us cause progressive dysfunction. We lose our hair, our eyebrows, our ability to fight infections. We seek out clinical trials, miracle drugs, a personal magic bullet. We feel sorrow as our plans evaporate, our careers end, and our physical selves deteriorate until we don’t recognize ourselves in the mirror. Sometimes cancer overwhelms those with whom we are closest. They die, making us scream in disbelief. Other days we stare ahead, dry-eyed, and wonder if we will be next. We grieve for losses, real and anticipated. And despite it all, somehow we sustain hope, even as the losses mount and the tears flow.Strosser has a few practical coping suggestions for Stage IV patients:Consider clinical trial participation sooner than later. Your body may be stronger then, increasing your odds of qualifying.Some hope stems from intensifying IBC research at the few leading US IBC centers (MD Anderson, Dana-Farber, Duke University, and Northwestern). Such work is funded in part through new, focused organizations like the IBC Network Foundation, which boosts patient awareness and raises money to fund research into what IBC is, how it spreads so fast, and how to control it. Dr. Jacqueline Bromberg of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center says that understanding IBC biology is “beyond complicated,” so focused research and information sharing among existing experts is essential to defining the problem, let alone solving it.Terry Arnold, IBC Network Foundation founder, says that understanding IBC’s science may be critical to helping patients to cope and to live, since early diagnosis isn’t yet possible:For IBC, focus on late-stage research and helping patients live with a late-stage diagnosis may be an important priority. We must translate the years of general breast cancer awareness into deliberate action against this lethal form of breast cancer. IBC kills quickly, so thousands of women urgently need new therapies now."

Thompson was also aware of his sexuality when they married in 1994.“She was understanding and I will always be grateful to her. We had a lot of fun, we have three fabulous daughters and I don’t regret any stage of my life,” he said.The couple divorced in 2011 and Mountbatten had a “gay fling” in the ensuing years, he told the Mail. But he never felt comfortable enough to come out about his sexuality until recently, when he met 54-year-old airline cabin services director James Coyle.The pair was skiing in Verbier, Switzerland when a chance encounter at a bar changed their lives forever.They immediately hit it off and exchanged phone numbers, they both recalled. Coyle was already open about his sexuality, having come out after his mother’s death in 2003. If this relationship was to continue, Coyle declared that it could not be in secret.“If I was going to be with him, it had to be in the open with friends and family. I wanted us to be honest, not to hide anything, not to be anything else,” Coyle told the Mail.Mountbatten agreed, first speaking with his family, who “could not be more supportive,” he said.The couple decided to come forward to the media after receiving inquires into their personal lives, they told the newspaper.In June, Prince William also made history by becoming the first royal to appear on the cover of a gay magazine.His photo spread on the U.K.’s Attitude Magazine followed joint efforts by his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, and his brother, Prince Harry, to address mental health issues and fight bullying that can come with it."

Things are getting complicated as China is reacting strongly against the Buddhist leader's continuous diplomatic moves, including his visit to the European Parliament, Belgium, and France. For instance, China postponed an upcoming China trip by an EU economic delegation. Moreover, China-Tibet conflict is likely to worsen as China is expected to resort to force. According to the September 18th report of Global Times, a daily newspaper under the People's Daily, China stressed disapproval to the European Parliament and other European countries at Dalai Lama's visit, which began on September 12. However, they did not accept China's request. Only France did not set up meetings between high-ranking officials and the Dalai Lama in response to the fierceness of China's response. Nevertheless, China is responding fiercely. This is because China is considering the Dalai Lama's visit to the European Parliament and his lecture in Paris as active political event. For now, China had only postponed MEP's China trip. But China could make additional measures. For instance, China could put a brake on economic cooperation with France and other countries. China could also stop high-level political exchanges for a while.  [The Dalai Lama has become a political hot potato in the international community once again. The picture is when he visited U.S. President Barack Obama in June./ Source: search engine Baidu]But China's such efforts are not doing much. Last June, the Dalai Lama visited the United States and met U.S. President Barack Obama and singer Lady Gaga without getting much pressure. Besides, Taiwan is considering inviting the Dalai Lama to visit the country. Recently, Taiwan Foreign Minister Li Dawei told lawmakers in parliament that if the Dalai Lama decides to come, the ministry will review the matter carefully. Obviously, this angered China. At a recent regular Beijing press conference, China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) spokesperson Ma Xiaoguang said, ""The Dalai Lama wears religious clothes to carry out separatist activities."" He warned that Taiwan should prepare for severe impact on relations across the Taiwan Strait if Taiwan approves Dalai Lama's visit. Considering Dalai Lama's moves in France and at the European Parliament as well as his possible visit to Taiwan, it's quite clear that he is still the spiritual leader of Tibet and hot potato in the international community."

In her new book, Corporate Citizen?: An Argument for the Separation of Corporation and State, Stetson law professor Ciara Torres-Spelliscy documents corporate efforts to dramatically enlarge their political and commercial speech and religious ""rights"" through lawsuits, campaign contributions, and lobbying. They also use these ""rights"" to limit their liability for the damage they do to investors, employees, customers, and the community. In an interview, Torres-Spelliscy discussed the impact corporate money has on preventing progress on issues like climate change and what options there are for reducing the distortion effect of corporate money from government. How did you first get interested in this issue?I first ran into the issue of money in politics as a senior at Harvard in a class called ""Democracy"" which was taught at the Harvard Law School. I had to read Who Will Tell The People by William Greider and that introduced me to the issue of corporate lobbying and campaign finance. Can you give some examples of corporate money distorting the legislative process in (1) Obamacare, (2) climate change, and/or (2) post-Enron era/post-financial meltdown reforms?As I discuss in Corporate Citizen?, corporate money can distort the legislative process by curtailing what is on the agenda of Members of Congress and by narrowing what lawmakers think is even possible. So for example, when the U.S. was revising its health care system, instead of going with a public option where the government provides health care for all, which is basically the approach of most western democracies, instead what American got with Obamacare was essentially a mandate for people of a certain income level to purchase private health insurance from private companies. This served the interests of private companies, but not necessarily the public. But because of years of lobbying--including derailing the efforts of President Bill Clinton to reform health care in the 1990s--the public option wasn't really even seriously considered as a starting point for the Obama Administration.  One of the most troubling conclusions I came to when writing Corporate Citizen? was that the American Congress seems utterly incapable of dealing with climate change. This is a potentially deadly mistake that even the U.S. military recognizes as an existential threat. When I asked environmentalists why Congressional inaction on climate was the case, I got very similar answers from scientist Gretchen Goldman, environmental lawyer Deborah Goldberg and the former head of Greenpeace, Phil Radford. They all described how industries--especially the oil and gas industries--were particularly effective at lobbying to get Congress and regulators to do as little as possible to protect the environment. A common theme each mentioned was the attempt by businesses to manufacture doubt about the underlying climate science by paying scientists to spout the industry position that climate change is not caused by man, even though the scientific consensus is that climate change is caused by human activity. This is very similar to recent revelations that the sugar industry paid scientists to cast doubt on the link between sugar and heart disease. The impact is similar, the public is confused about what the truth is, and meanwhile elected officials are provided cover for failing to act. I find this lack of urgency on the issue of climate change personally troubling as I live in Florida, close to the coast. If nothing is done about climate change federally, my community and my home could be literally under water.Even after corporate interests like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers lose a legislative fight like with the passage of Dodd-Frank, they don't give up waging the war. After Dodd-Frank became law, these trade associations were active challenging many regulations that were promulgated under Dodd-Frank through litigation. For example, these trade associations were successful in stopping Dodd-Frank's proxy access rule, the conflict mineral rule and a rule on reporting payments to foreign governments by extractive industries. Frequently, the arguments raised in these cases tried to expand corporate First Amendment rights by making elaborate claims about how a given regulation was unconstitutional.After the Citizens United decision, what are the options at the state or federal level to limit the amount or increase transparency in corporate political contributions and lobbying expenses?As I explicate in Corporate Citizen?, because Citizens United was decided on Constitutional First Amendment grounds, it severely curtails the options for state and federal regulators to limit corporate money in politics--especially if the money is spent independently of candidates. But there is some room for Congress and the states to maneuver. For one, because of a case called Beaumont from 2003, states can still ban corporate contributions that are given directly to candidates' political campaigns. And the federal government and states can vastly improve their disclosure of the sources of money in politics--ending the dark money problem. The Supreme Court in Citizens United ruled in favor of disclosure by a margin of 8 to 1. This frees federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to all improve transparency of political spending. Do other countries limit corporate political contributions?According to Transparency International, Belgium, Estonia, France, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Portugal all ban corporate political contributions, as does the United States at the federal level under the Tillman Act of 1907. The catch is in over half of the 50 states in America, corporations can give money directly to state candidates. And furthermore, as I noted in Corporate Citizen? because of Citizens United, corporations are free to spend an unlimited amount of money on political ads (making the underlying federal contribution ban nearly meaningless). What is ""dark money?"" How do litigation and bankruptcy proceedings give us insight into the size and use of ""dark money?""So-called ""dark money"" is money that is spent in politics--typically to buy political ads--without revealing to the public who paid for the political expenditure. Dark money can be revealed through bankruptcies if the debtor was a source of dark money. Clever investigative reporters have discovered that when they pull the matrix of creditors in certain bankruptcies like that of Corinthian Colleges and coal company Alpha Natural Resources, they find dark money conduits are listed. This means that these corporations were spending dark money before they went bankrupt. Also on occasion, courts will order a dark money spender who is violating a disclosure law to actually tell the public where their money came from. This happened in Montana with a group called Western Tradition Partnership (which later changed its name to American Tradition Partnership). As I explain in Corporate Citizen? this group had bragged to donors that only they would know who had influenced the election. This promise of anonymity was one Western Tradition Partnership couldn't legally keep.What is the best hope for solving this problem?The antidote to expanding corporate political power is placing more power in the hands of American voters. While certain regressive states have made it harder for voters to exercise the franchise though restrictive voter ID laws or cutbacks in early voting, there is some forward motion to empower voters as well. As I wrote in Corporate Citizen?, California and Oregon have adopted automatic voter registration. And since the book was written, Connecticut, Vermont, and West Virginia have passed similar laws empowering American voters. More states should follow suit-- placing voters back at the center of the democratic process."

10,WORLDPOST,New Armenian Prime Minister Is Pro-Russia and Not a Champion of the Little Guy,"Armine Sahakyan, ContributorHuman rights activist based in Armenia, Columnist with the Kyi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-armenian-prime-minist_b_12069066.html,,2016-09-18,2016-09-18-1474181016-1513934-Karen_karapetyan_government.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-18-1474181016-1513934-Karen_karapetyan_government-thumb.png,"Image: Armenia's new Prime Minister Karen Karapetyan. Public DomainHundreds of Armenian bigwigs were in a festive mood as they filed into a concert hall in the capital of Yerevan on December 3, 2010, for a concert by opera star Placido Domingo.The upbeat mood didn't last long for one of the preeners, though.When the wife of Mayor Gagik Beglaryan tried to sit next to President Serzh Sargsyan, one of Sargsyan's aides told her the seats on either side of the president are reserved for the prime minister and the head of Armenia's Apostolic Church. The wife, Nouneh Nikolyan, was furious. She complained bitterly about it to her husband, who was not at the concert.The next day Beglaryan demanded a meeting with the aide, Aram Kandayan.The mayor, surrounded by bodyguards, took Kandayan to a factory and beat the hell out of him, according to news accounts.Armenia has had a history of politicians using their positions to get away with assaulting someone they're angry with, but Sargsyan was unable to ignore this one. By attacking a Sargsyan aide, Beglaryan was mounting a direct challenge to the president's authority.Sargsyan fired him as mayor.This sordid chapter led to Karen Karapetyan, the head of Russia's natural-gas operation in Armenia, obtaining his first public-leadership position. Sargsyan named Karapetyan mayor of Yerevan a few days after firing Beglaryan in December of 2010. Karapetyan kept the post only a year before returning to Gazprom.Now Sargsyan has thrown Karapetyan into another emergency situation: The tense aftermath of an armed group's police-station takeover in July that turned into a general uprising against the Sargsyan regime. This time Karapetyan has stepped into Armenia's second-most-important position, the prime ministership. He replaces Hovik Abrahamyan, whom Sargsyan made a sacrificial lamb for Armenia's continuing economic problems and for the government's inept handling of the police-station takeover.Because Karapetyan assumed both the mayor's and prime minister's positions reluctantly -- to bail the government out of jams -- some political analysts are dubbing him the ""accidental politician.""Underscoring that designation, his tenure as prime minister is likely to be only seven months longer than his 12 months in the mayor's post.That's because Armenia is changing from a strong-president to a parliamentary system in 19 months. Sargsyan changed the constitution in December of 2015 because it would have limited him to two terms in the nation's highest office, the presidency.The new system makes the prime minister instead of the president the nation's premier leader, and Sargsyan is expected to become prime minister when the new political system goes into effect in 2018.This means that Karapetyan will stay in the prime minister's post only 19 months.Will he able to make a difference in that limited time frame, even if he wants to? Probably not. And his background suggests he won't want to make a difference.Here are some things to remember about him:1. Karapetyan is pro-Russian at a time when a growing number of Armenians believe the country's best chance for prosperity is looking toward Europe. He built his fortune working for Gazprom, first in Armenia and then in Russia. He was CEO of Gazprom's Armenian subsidiary, ArmRosGazprom, from 2001 to 2010. He left the Yerevan mayor's post in December 2011 to become first vice president of Gazprom Bank in Moscow. He has been deputy general director of Gazprom Mezhregiongaz since November 2012.With his continued career success tied to Russia, Karapetyan is unlikely to take any steps as prime minister to move Armenia away from its dependence on Moscow.2. Karapetyan is unlikely to do anything for Armenia's little guys, the rank-and-file whose lives get worse each year. In fact, if his past performance is a predictor, he's likely to try to make things worse for the little guys.Although Karapetyan was mayor of Yerevan only a year, many residents remember his attempt to get rid of the city's street vendors.His justification was that those selling vegetables, fruits, household items and crafts on the street were involved in the shadow economy -- economic activities that were unregistered and thus yielding no tax money for the government.His crackdown led to hundreds of vendors protesting and to sympathy demonstrations by the public at large.""Isn't it obvious that if I had another job, I wouldn't be standing in the cold, selling fruits and chocolate to make ends meet?"" wailed one of the vendors, pensioner Karen Hakobyan. ""Of course, Karen Karapetyan wants to see Yerevan free of street vendors' stalls when he looks at them out of the windows of his luxury limousine. But what am I to do? Is the mayor going to support my family?""Although Karapetyan has been in the prime minister's post only a few days, he has already signaled that he plans another attempt to crush the shadow economy -- this time not just in Yerevan but in the nation as a whole. ""The Armenian economy has no chance of being reformed without a fight against the shadow economy,"" he asserted.3. Karapetyan is likely to be a caretaker rather than a trailblazer in the prime minister's post. In other words, he's likely to talk a good game but do little. Borrowing a street vendor analogy, Karapetyan won't want to upset the apple cart for Sargsyan before Sargsyan moves into the prime minister's post in 2018.After the police-station takeover ignited a general uprising against the Sargsyan regime, the shaken president promised economic and political reform, including a government of national unity that includes opposition figures in the cabinet.He also fired Abrahamyan as prime minister to demonstrate that he's serious about reform -- whether he is or not.If he had wanted a reformist prime minister, however, he would have chosen someone besides Karapetyan, who has been a cautious business executive most of his life.That has prompted many observers to conclude that Karapetyan will simply be trying to keep domestic political turmoil from boiling over during his tenure as prime minister, and not making substantive policy changes.A fresh face in the prime minister's position will give some Armenians hope that the anemic economy will improve, the gap between rich and poor will shrink, and corruption won't be as pervasive.I don't have the heart to remind those who are clinging to hope that Armenia has had 18 prime ministers in its 25 years of independence, and is still one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union.Armine Sahakyan is a human rights activist based in Armenia. A columnist with the Kyiv Post and a blogger with The Huffington Post, she writes on human rights and democracy in Russia and the former Soviet Union."

All the windows have small panes design, what Americans appropriately call ""French windows.""The pitched roofs are ornate with restrained small-paned windows hiding what were likely the individual maids' quarters (chambres de bonnes), that are now transformed into lower-ceiling apartments when several are joined. Victor Hugo lived here from 1832 to 1848 and wrote about a dozen of his masterpieces in his quiet apartment. Now a museum where visitors can see the desk and ink bottles used by the genius writer. A part of his masterpiece novel Les Misérables was created here.Famous people of the days counted the cardinal of Richelieu, Madame de Sévigné, Alphonse Daudet, and Bossuet. Marguerite Louise d'Orléans, wife of Cosimo III de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany kept a favorite flat there.Nowadays, many celebrities (I shall name none), movie stars, politicians, star writers and others reside around the expensive and lovely perimeter. Often photographed as background for photo shoots and movies, the square stays intimist and elitist. (Bettina posing in 1950.)Art galleries, cafés, designer shops, perfume stores, couture houses, and many specialty boutiques now lined the arcades, making for a wonderful walking promenade, even in inclement weather. My very own favorite tea room is under the arcades here, Carette, out of the hundreds of pastries shops in Paris, this one is definitely number one for its location. Divine classic onion soup as an afternoon alternative to tea is a delight and can be served here with Champagne - for a more risqué afternoon treat.The center of the plaza is named Square Louis XIII and is bordered by trees, with four fountains in the middle of well-groomed grass expanses, and an equestrian statue of the said king. Nothing around really hit the eyes as modern, and it's a wonderful nostalgic feeling to be able to walk in royal steps. And even if, like Lorde sang: ""We'll never be royals / It don't run in our blood / That kind of luxe just ain't for us"", one can still feel somewhat regal by just walking in the footsteps of royalty.INFO: Situated across both the 3rd and the 4th arrondissement of Paris.

14,ARTS,The Harmonic Sorcery of Jerry Bergonzi:Spotlight on Standards,"Ralph A. Miriello, ContributorJazz Journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-harmonic-sorcery-of-j_b_12075346.html,,2016-09-18,2016-09-18-1474230026-760561-61itPJkldEL._SY355_.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-18-1474230026-760561-61itPJkldEL._SY355_-thumb.jpg,"The Boston based tenor magician Jerry Bergonzi returns to the organ/tenor/drums format to spin his harmonic sorcery on his latest offering titled Spotlight on Standards. The saxophonist/educator known as the Gonz, while lauded by the insular community of his peers, is not a household name among the general public. He is known for his muscular, hard edged sound, his exquisite fiery technique and his boundless creativity.Jerry Bergonzi grew up in Boston and started on clarinet at age eight. He credits a musical uncle who used to live upstairs from him with turning him onto jazz early. In youth bands he learned from two of the best instructors, John Laporta and Joe Viola and eventually studied music education at University of Mass in Lowell, MA. Bergonzi spent several years in New York developing his sound, jamming and shedding with other notable musicians of his era before getting a call from pianist Dave Brubeck. With Brubeck, Bergonzi traveled and played some of the largest and most prestigious festivals and venues in the world. It was a liberating experience and a steady paycheck. The first recording on his discography is from 1973 on Brubeck's Two Generations of Brubeck. The now sixty-eight-year-old Bergonzi was the saxophonist with Brubeck's Quartet from 1973-1975 and then again from 1979 to 1982. By the early eighties Bergonzi was back in Boston and began his teaching career, first with private instruction, then publishing books on improvisation and eventually becoming a full time professor at The New England Conservatory of Music where he teaches to this day. Over the years Bergonzi has written upward of one hundred songs and played as a leader or sideman on over thirty records.On his latest, Spotlight on Standards, Bergonzi is joined by organist Renato Chicco and drummer Andrea Michelutti. This organ trio format is one the saxophonist last used with organist Dan Wall and drummer Adam Nussbaum back in 1999.From the opening lines of the Cy Coleman classic ""Witchcraft"" you can hear Bergonzi's muscular tenor is not about to play this or anything else straight up. It is his resolute willingness to re-harmonize the theme in his own unique way that makes the music so much more than a re-hash of an old standard. This is a re-imagining of the song where the melody is a mere armature upon which to reconstruct something fresh and new. Coupled with his signature saxophone sound the song takes on a new life.The next four tunes are all Bergonzi originals. His distinctive technique uses creative articulation, a fluidity of thoughts and innovative dynamics to achieve that most precious of commodities- originality. Listen to the elastic logic of his saxophone on his composition ""Bi-Polar."" The notes gush like a wellspring of exploratory thought from a savant's mind. On ""Blue Cube"" he creates a memorable repeating motif. Chicco and Michelutti sustain the easy shuffle over which Bergonzi offers a series of deliberate, sometimes searing lines. He often takes no easily readable path, but nonetheless he lead you to his intended destination. Chicco's B3 soloing is subtly but equally probing.""First Lady"" is an interesting composition with an uplifting, almost Bossa feel. Bergonzi's use of the lower register of his instrument never fails to swing. He drifts over the changes with an airy lightness and solid conviction. Michelutti is a master of interjecting timely accents while maintaining a rock-steady rhythm.Bergonzi's mournful ""Gabriella"" is perhaps his most sensitive ballad on this album. The plaintive tenor sound is quite compelling throughout, offering a window into the deepest recesses of the artist's soul. It is a wistful cry that cannot be ignored. Chicco's deft church-like organ brings a pious, religious quality to the whole proceeding. Bergonzi's command of his instrument, using it as an extension of the human voice, is extraordinary.The program returns to the American Songbook with ""Dancing in the Dark,"" and ""Out of Nowhere."" At all times the group displays a solid swing and a masterful ability to create surprising iterations of the melody. On Johnny Mercer's ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" we find Bergonzi's at his best. His punchy sound articulates with authority as the rhythm section grooves along. He seems to draw from an inexhaustible well of ideas that never seem to repeat and never fail to surprise.Ned Washington and Victor Young's venerable standard ""Stella by Starlight"" is treated with authority and conviction when Bergonzi and company re-imagine this classic. The solid swing, the aggressive declaration of Bergonzi's saxophone with his rapid fire lines and Chicco's unusual B3 musings that seem to directly descend from Larry Young, make this one special. It's almost an entirely new song. Bergonzi's solo is overflowing, bursting with ideas, Chicco's playing is stellar and Michelutti is so subtly correct as to be transcendent.Click Here for a link to hear ""Witchraft"" from Spotlight on Standards"

People in both groups have found his leadership in the “birther” movement offensive because it tried to delegitimize the nation’s first black president.While Trump’s aides and surrogates attempted Friday to blame birtherism on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, Florida Republican Party chairman Blaise Ingoglia said he considers the matter closed.“Mr. Trump came out and made that statement. That should put it to bed,” Ingoglia said.Whether minority voters agree with him enough that they help Trump carry the state in November remains to be seen. The GOP nominee has polled exceptionally poorly with both African-American and Latino voters nationally, although the large percentage of Republican-leaning Cuban-American voters in Florida has given him relatively stronger support among Hispanics there than in other key swing states.At the Miami rally, Trump largely gave what’s become his standard stump speech of late, adding a line promising to help the people of Cuba stand up to their communist leaders and boasting about his Florida golf courses.“I have a lot of employees, and I pay them a lot of money. And by the way, a lot of African-American employees, a lot of Hispanic employees ― a lot. And they’re very happy,” Trump said. “They like Donald Trump.”He visited a community center in the city’s Little Haiti neighborhood prior to arriving at the downtown James Knight Center auditorium, which was filled to its 5,500-person capacity with his supporters.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

You can’t do that with a tie vote.”Before Scalia’s death, the Supreme Court was widely expected to make a lot of noise with decisions that could’ve reshaped the law for a generation on issues such as the president’s power to enforce immigration law, the future of public sector unions, and the clash between religious freedom and contraception access.But in a number of those areas the justices went out with a whimper ― divided 4-to-4 and leaving the law as if the court had never agreed to hear the case.Kagan called this inability to decide a “disability” for the court, but she did give Chief Justice John Roberts some credit for trying to steer her and her colleagues toward common ground.“I think enormous credit goes to the chief justice in that, who has really tried to forge compromise and really tried to get us to keep to a minimum the number of cases where we just throw up our hands and say, ‘We can’t reach a decision,’” Kagan said.But she added that there have been moments of indecision ― sometimes to the point that the compromise or the “narrowing” of the case is such that it makes it worse off for everybody else.“In other words,” Kagan explained, “narrowing them so far that it left undecided the real reason why we took the case, and the real thing that’s confounding the lower courts. And, you know, over time that’s a problem.”President Barack Obama, who in March offered a nominee to fill Scalia’s vacant seat, acknowledged as much in June when the Supreme Court was deadlocked on the fate of his ambitious effort to defer deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants, the vast majority parents of American citizens and permanent residents.“This is part of the consequence of a Republican failure so far to give a fair hearing to Merrick Garland, my nominee to the Supreme Court,” Obama told reporters after the ruling was announced. This failure to decide, the president added, is “a very clear reminder of why it’s so important for the Supreme Court to have a full bench.”Thus far, his appeals have fallen on deaf ears. Back in full swing after a seven-week recess, Senate leadership has shown no signs or willingness to give Garland a hearing before the election. And even Hillary Clinton has sent strong signals that she might not stick with the 63-year-old judge if she wins the presidency.In her Harvard remarks, Kagan steered clear of talking confirmation politics directly. But she was not shy about what the empty seat does to the Supreme Court’s inner workings ― suggesting that its work and overall decision-making power could take a toll in the long run.“I think all of us have tried hard to find ways of resolving cases, which are not so apparent on the surface,” she said. “But is that cost-free? No, it’s absolutely not.”"

In a direct comparison, Americans say by a 19-point margin, 53 percent to 34 percent, that Trump is the more extreme of the two.Views of which candidate is more extreme divide generally along party lines, with 86 percent of Democrats naming Trump, 60 percent of Republicans naming Clinton and independents split between Trump and Clinton at 45 percent and 38 percent, respectively.But although most Republicans are comfortable with Trump’s positions, 27 percent believe that he is too extreme ― considerably higher than the 11 percent of Democrats who say the same of Clinton.Since Trump won the nomination, it seems every show of even modest restraint on his part has sparked a debate over whether or not he was “pivoting” to a more moderate position. Trump himself shot down that idea, telling a Wisconsin TV station last month that “I am who I am. It’s me. I don’t want to change.” Thirty percent of Americans say Trump has gotten more extreme since becoming the nominee, while 27 percent say he’s gotten less extreme and 35 percent that he’s stayed about the same.Members of Trump’s own party are the most likely to believe that he’s moderated. Forty percent of Republicans, compared to just 13 percent of Democrats, say he’s become less extreme since the start of the general election campaign.The majority of Americans ― 53 percent ― say Clinton has stayed about the same since winning the Democratic nomination, with 29 percent saying she’s gotten more extreme and 9 percent that she has become less so.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 10-Sept. 12 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Security Council meeting as tensions between Moscow and Washington escalated.The United States military said the coalition stopped the attacks against what it had believed to be Islamic State positions in northeast Syria after Russia informed it that Syrian military personnel and vehicles may have been hit.The United States relayed its “regret” through the Russian government for what it described as the unintentional loss of life of Syrian forces in the strike, a senior Obama administration official said in an emailed statement.The 15-member Security Council met on Saturday night after Russia demanded an emergency session to discuss the incident and accused the United States of jeopardizing the Syria deal.The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, chastised Russia for the move.“Russia really needs to stop the cheap point scoring and the grandstanding and the stunts and focus on what matters, which is implementation of something we negotiated in good faith with them,” Power told reporters before the meeting.She said the United States was investigating the air strikes and “if we determine that we did indeed strike Syrian military personnel, that was not our intention and we of course regret the loss of life.”When asked if the incident ended the Syria deal between Moscow and Washington, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said: “This is a very big question mark.”“I would be very interested to see how Washington is going to react. If what Ambassador Power has done today is any indication of their possible reaction then we are in serious trouble,” Churkin told reporters.Moscow cited the strikes, which allowed Islamic State fighters to briefly overrun a Syrian army position near Deir al-Zor airport, as evidence that the United States was helping the jihadist militants.“We are reaching a really terrifying conclusion for the whole world: That the White House is defending Islamic State. Now there can be no doubts about that,” the RIA Novosti news agency quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying.She said the strikes threatened to undermine the ceasefire in Syria brokered by Russia, which has been aiding Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war, and the United States, which has backed some rebel groups.The Russian Defence Ministry said U.S. jets had killed more than 60 Syrian soldiers in four air strikes by two F-16s and two A-10s coming from the direction of Iraq.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group with contacts across Syria, cited a military source at Deir al-Zor airport as saying at least 80 Syrian soldiers had been killed.The ceasefire, which took effect on Monday, is the most significant peacemaking effort in Syria for months, but has been undermined by repeated accusations of violations on both sides and by a failure to bring humanitarian aid to besieged areas.Apart from the U.S. and Russian involvement, Assad is supported by Iran and Arab Shi’ite militias, while Sunni rebels seeking to unseat him are backed by Turkey and Gulf Arab states.All the warring parties are also sworn enemies of Islamic State, whose territory extends along the Euphrates valley from the Iraqi border, including around Deir al-Zor, up to land near Syria’s frontier with Turkey.In its sixth year, the conflict has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced half of Syria’s pre-war population, prompted a refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe and inspired a wave of jihadist attacks across the world.Syria’s army said the U.S.-led strikes, which took place at around 5 p.m. local time (1400 GMT) were “conclusive evidence” of U.S. support for Islamic State, calling them “dangerous and blatant aggression”.The U.S. military said in its statement that Syria was a “complex situation” but that “coalition forces would not intentionally strike a known Syrian military unit”.Islamic State said via its Amaq news channel it had taken complete control of Jebel Tharda, where the bombed position was located, which would have allowed it to overlook government-held areas of Deir al-Zor.The city’s airport and some districts have been entirely surrounded by Islamic State since last year, with the airport providing their only external access.However, Russia and Syrian state media said the Syrian army later recaptured positions it had lost. The Observatory monitoring group said at least 20 Islamic State fighters were killed in heavy Russian air strikes during that fighting.The incident also threatens to undermine proposed joint targeting by the United States and Russia of Islamic State and some other jihadist groups across Syria.SHAKY TRUCEEarlier on Saturday, Russia and Syrian rebels cast doubt over the prospects for the increasingly shaky ceasefire, with Moscow saying the situation was worsening and a senior insurgent warning that the truce “will not hold out”.While the ceasefire has reduced fighting, some violence has persisted across Syria. Meanwhile, there has been little movement on promised aid deliveries to besieged areas and both sides have accused the other of bad faith.Russia’s Defence Ministry said conditions in Syria were deteriorating, adding that it believed the ceasefire had been breached 199 times by rebels and saying the United States would be responsible if it were to collapse.After the Deir al-Zor attack, it said Moscow had told the United States to rein in the Syrian opposition and make sure it did not launch a new offensive, adding that it had informed Washington about a concentration of rebels north of Hama.Insurgents say they only reluctantly accepted the initial deal, which they believe is skewed against them, because it could relieve the dire humanitarian situation in besieged areas they control, and blamed Russia for undermining the truce.“The truce, as we have warned, and we told the (U.S.) State Department - will not hold out,” a senior rebel official in Aleppo said, pointing to the continued presence of a U.N. aid convoy at the Turkish border awaiting permission to enter.Rebels have also accused Russia of using the ceasefire to give the Syrian army and allied Shi’ite militias a chance to regroup and deploy forces ready for their own offensives.OVERNIGHT SHELLINGBoth sides have accused the other of being responsible for aid deliveries being stuck far from Aleppo, where army and rebel forces were supposed to pull back from the Castello Road which leads into besieged, insurgent-held eastern districts.Russia on Friday said the Syrian army had initially withdrawn but returned to its positions after being fired on by rebels, who in turn say they saw no sign of government forces ever leaving their positions.“There is no change,” Zakariya Malahifji, an official for a rebel group in Aleppo, said on Saturday when asked whether there had been any move by the army to withdraw from positions along the road.Syria’s government said it was doing all that was necessary for the arrival of aid to those in need in all parts of the country, particularly eastern Aleppo.Two convoys of aid for Aleppo have been waiting at the Turkish border for days. The U.N. has said both sides in the war are to blame for the delay of aid to Aleppo, where neither has yet withdrawn from the Castello Road.The government said the road was being fired on by rebels, so it could not give convoys a guarantee of safety. The rebels deny the accusation.Senior U.N. officials have accused the government of failing to provide letters to allow convoys to reach other besieged areas in Syria.(Additional reporting by Tom Perry in Beirut, Katya Golubkova and Andrew Osborn in Moscow, Olesya Astakhova in Bishkek, Phil Stewart in Split, Croatia, Patricia Zengerle in Washington, Michelle Nichols in New York and Humeyra Pamuk in Istanbul; Editing by Dominic Evans, Paul Simao and Mary Milliken)"

In one study, American students and Tamil speakers in India both called the angular shape on the left ""kiki"" and the curvy one on the right ""bouba.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57dc1ab3180000113cbd1e79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A painter who hears noise in colors. A musician who sees sounds in shapes. People who taste words. These are just some examples of what it’s like to have synesthesia ― a condition where input received via one sense triggers a response from another sense, causing people to experience reduced boundaries between vision, hearing and other types of perception. Now, a study published Sept. 15 in the European Journal of Neuroscience suggests that simply having one type of synesthesia ― for example, seeing colors in letters of the alphabet ― is enough to blur the lines between other senses as well.“It shows that something about their synesthesia is spilling over into another domain,” Dr. Krish Sathian, a neurologist at Emory University, said in a press release.The findings may help researchers pin down the exact cause of synesthesia, which remains mysterious. Are the brains of people with synesthesia wired differently from everyone else’s? Or are they simply ordinary brains doing what ordinary brains do, only more intensely?We don’t yet have enough data to say for sure, but the new research suggests it may be the latter. Most people, even those without synesthesia, make some implicit associations between different sensory features. We describe people’s voices as “sharp” or “soft” as if they’re things we can touch. Or we talk of painting a room in “warm” colors.One famous example of these so-called cross-modal correspondences is the Bouba-Kiki effect, first observed by the psychologist Wolfgang Köhler in 1929. Experiments have shown that no matter what language someone speaks, he or she is more likely to assign the name “bouba” to a round-cornered shape and the name “kiki” to an angular shape than the other way around.“Some argue that these phenomena form a continuum, with classical synesthesia being an exaggeration of universal cross-modal correspondences,” the researchers note in this week’s paper. “Others contend that the two are quite different.” The people in the study had the most common form of synesthesia ― a type known as grapheme-color synesthesia, which causes people to perceive colors in letters and numbers.But during tests, the researchers found that these people are also more likely than their non-synesthete peers to make associations between shapes and meaningless words.“We conclude that synesthesia heightens universally experienced cross-modal correspondences,” the researchers said.Synesthesia is thought to be rare, but estimates are highly variable and unclear. Anecdotally the condition has been linked to creativity, with some research backing it up. One study in Australia found 24 percent of synesthetes to be involved in an artistic profession. Among the general population, this figure falls to just 2 percent.It may be possible to learn synesthesia, by consciously trying to associate different sensory modalities, to improve your memory and creativity.And some researchers argue that true synesthetes, too, have learned the associations during childhood. One study last year found a link between the colors that some people see in letters and the colors of a popular brand of refrigerator magnets. That might be hard for synesthetes to believe, however, since they often perceive the letters in highly irregular, complex and almost otherworldly hues. "

He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform. He is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief,” Gates wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Friday evening.Gates wrote that Trump was clueless when it came to the American military and foreign policy. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly, threatened to not defend NATO countries, said he would “bomb the shit” out of ISIS and seemed unfamiliar with Russia’s annexation of Crimea.“Mr. Trump is also willfully ignorant about the rest of the world, about our military and its capabilities, and about government itself. He disdains expertise and experience while touting his own—such as his claim that he knows more about ISIS than America’s generals,” Gates wrote. “He has no clue about the difference between negotiating a business deal and negotiating with sovereign nations.”Gates ran the CIA under President George H.W. Bush and served as defense secretary under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He wrote that all the leaders he served were smart enough to listen to their advisers ― even if they didn’t take their advice. Trump, he worried, would not.“The world we confront is too perilous and too complex to have as president a man who believes he, and he alone, has all the answers and has no need to listen to anyone. In domestic affairs, there are many checks on what a president can do; in national security there are few constraints,” he said. “A thin-skinned, temperamental, shoot-from-the-hip and lip, uninformed commander-in-chief is too great a risk for America.”Case in point: just last week, Trump threatened to start a war with Iran over hand gestures.Trump responded to Gates in a tweet Saturday morning, saying his leadership had been “a total disaster.” Gates, who has been critical of the Obama administration, wrote that Hillary Clinton still had time before the election to demonstrate her trustworthiness and show voters how she would deal with foreign policy issues in China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and the Middle East.Gates joins a number of national security officials ― Democrats and Republicans ― who have said Trump would make the United States less safe.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
21,GREEN,New Baby Giraffe Born At Zoo That Killed 'Surplus' Giraffe 2 Years Ago,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/giraffe-baby-born-copenhagen-zoo-marius_us_57dd9e0be4b08cb140962dda,The death of 2-year-old Marius in 2014 sparked global outrage.,2016-09-17,Marius before being dissected as part of a public presentation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A baby giraffe has been born at a zoo that faced international outrage after workers killed a “surplus” young giraffe in 2014.Denmark’s Copenhagen Zoo posted a video of the new giraffe’s birth to YouTube on Friday, showing the young animal exiting the mother’s body and quickly gaining footing as onlookers cheered.But only a little more than two years ago, the same zoo killed a healthy 2-year-old giraffe, claiming that the young male was “a surplus animal.”That giraffe, named Marius, was not inbred. However, zoo officials said his genes were too common in the zoo population and thus he would be of no use for breeding.So in February 2014, a zookeeper lured Marius away from the other animals with his favorite food, a piece of rye bread. Then a veterinarian shot him in the head with a bolt gun, National Geographic reported at the time.Zoo workers later publicly dissected Marius’ body for an educational demonstration. They fed meat from the body to the zoo’s lions, which was the reason they shot him instead of using lethal injection, according to the Guardian.The decision sparked outrage from rights groups and animal lovers around the world, who felt killing Marius was cruel and unnecessary ― especially since some other zoos, including Yorkshire Wildlife Park in the UK, offered to take him.Zoo spokesman Jacob Hoeck told The Huffington Post in an email that it is “still too soon to say” whether the newborn giraffe could end up with the same fate.“It will stay with the rest of the giraffes for the next couple of years though,” Hoeck said. “But when the giraffe is about 2 years old it will be moved to another European zoo.”Killing an animal was not a one-off event for the zoo.Workers killed four lions — a breeding pair and their young offspring — weeks after Marius’ death in order to make way for a new male lion coming to the zoo to form a breeding group, CNN reported at the time. In 2012, the facility used lethal injection to kill two leopard cubs for the same reason they killed Marius — their genes were “overrepresented” in the zoo’s population and they would have been of no use for breeding.And those are just the animals that got media attention. The zoo’s conservation director, Bengt Holst, told the BBC that the zoo culls 20 to 30 animals every year for the purposes of managing populations.Some zoos, especially in the United States, administer contraception to animals to avoid having “extra” offspring, according to The New York Times. And Times reporter Leslie Kaufman noted in 2012 that “it might seem suspiciously convenient” when a zoo kills an animal “just after it has completed its most adorable phase.” After all, zoogoers love seeing baby animals.But Holst told the Times that the reason Copenhagen Zoo avoids contraception is because allowing animals to breed is more “natural.” Euthanizing some of the offpsiring also mimics nature because in the wild, many young animals die of predation, injury or other natural causes, he added.“We’d rather they have as natural behavior as possible,” he said. “We have already taken away their predatory and antipredatory behaviors. If we take away their parenting behavior, they have not much left.”Hoeck, the zoo spokesman, tol HuffPost that the zoo’s breeding policy is unchanged, but added that “it is a bit more nuanced than a mimic of nature.” He pointed to a frequently asked questions section on the zoo’s website that addresses its rationale:Copenhagen Zoo’s animals are part of an international breeding programme which aims at ensuring a healthy animal population in European zoos. This is done by constantly ensuring that only unrelated animals breed so that inbreeding is avoided. If an animal’s genes are well represented in a population further breeding with that particular animal is unwanted. When an animal’s genes are well represented in the breeding programme and there is no place for the animal in another zoo, the European Breeding Programme has agreed that the animal is to be euthanized. This is a situation that we know from other group animals that breed well. When breeding success increases it is sometimes necessary to euthanize.Copenhagen Zoo is not the only European wildlife center that deals with “surplus” animals. Dr. Leslie Dickie, executive director of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, told the BBC shortly after Marius’ death that between 3,000 and 5,000 animals are “management-euthanized” in European zoos each year. That number includes smaller animals, like tadpoles, she said, noting that when it comes to larger animals like lions and bears, she estimates the number drops to “less than a few hundred” annually.This article has been updated with comments from zoo spokesman Jacob Hoeck."

At the closing ceremony last Tuesday, they received the gold medals and the traditional Azerbaijani hats - the papaqs. Sam Shankland raised the Hamilton-Russell trophy that travels with every winning team until the next olympiad. For the next two years, it will be displayed at the World Chess Hall of Fame in Saint Louis, Missouri. The last time the United States won was 40 years ago at the 1976 Chess Olympiad in Haifa. At that time, the gold medals hung on one single game that was out of our hands and lasted 14 hours and 111 moves. It ended in our favor. The last round in Baku was even more of a nail-biter and the gold depended on a single move. Only when an Estonian player took a wrong turn and lost to his German opponent could the Americans celebrate. Why was it so close when they did almost everything right? They finished undefeated with 20 match points, winning nine matches and drawing with Russia and the Czechs. But the team of Ukraine also scored 20 points. They lost to the U.S., but beat all the other teams, including the defending champions China and the top seeded Russia. It was down to a complicated tiebreak, an antiquated entity based on the results of other teams. Russia secured the bronze with 18 points. China won the gold in the Women's section. Poland clinched the silver medals with a better tiebreak over the bronze Ukraine. The current finance minister of Latvia, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, surprised everybody with a fine victory over the Women's world champion Hou Yifan.  Ukraine won the Gaprindashvili Cup, one country combined results from the Open and Women sections. Baadur Jobava of Georgia had the best result on the top board (8/10).  Eugene Torre, 64, played in his 23rd Olympiad, a record, and scored the most points (10/11). The world champion Magnus Carlsen led Norway to its historically best fifth place. Carlsen will be promoting chess in New Jersey next week, playing an exhibition match against Fabiano Caruana (see below) before starting his preparation for the World Championship match scheduled for November in New York.A dream teamThe top three grandmasters on the U.S. team are now rated among the best seven players in the world, but the team was seeded second behind Russia. On paper, it was a toss up, but the Russians were brought to a standstill after India tied them 2-2 one round before the end. In that match Pentala Harikrishna beat the world championship challenger Sergey Karjakin. Here are the U.S. team results:Caruana and Wesley So were undefeated. Hikaru Nakamura was the workhorse, playing all 11 games, and was almost knocked out by a cold in the last few rounds. Sam Shankland did well until the last round. Ray Robson's unfortunate loss to Alexander Grischuk of Russia made it hard to put him back in the lineup.The U.S. team captain John Donaldson pointed out that the team had great chemistry, the players were helping each other despite their individual rivalries.  Donaldson had several great achievements as team captain. Baku was his 12th Olympiad. The U.S. team won one gold (2016), one silver (1990) and four bronze medals (1986, 1996, 2006, 2008) under his leadership. He also led U.S. teams at the World Team championships (gold 1993, silver 1997 and 2009) and Pan-Am championships (gold 2013).A guide to Olympic gold and other medalsBefore 2008 the medals were decided by board points and every single game was important. The match points settle the outcome now. In either case the following rules help to get the medals: Rule 1 - Defeat your rivalsIn 1984 in Thessaloniki, the U.S. team defeated the Soviets, but the Russians won the gold anyway. England finished second and we were in a fight for the bronze with the Hungarians. After three draws, I beat Lajos Portisch on the top board and we ended third by a half point. With his looks, determination and mental strength, Caruana resembles a Tour de France climber and he brings these attributes to the chessboard. The U.S. champion finished undefeated in Baku and was instrumental in beating Ukraine. After three draws, he masterfully exploited a better pawn structure. His win kept Ukraine out of the top spot.Caruana,Fabiano (2808) - Eljanov,Pavel (2739) 42nd Chess Olympiad, Baku 2016The material is equal, but White has a strong distant passed a-pawn and the black split pawns are weak. In time pressure, Eljanov commits a sin: he immobilizes his own rook, allowing Caruana's a-pawn a free ride.  38...Rf8  Giving up the pawn immediately does not help: 38...c5 39.Re4 Ra7 40.Qxc5 Rd7 41.a5 and Black has to worry not only about the a-pawn, but also about his own e-pawn.  39.Re4 Rf7 40.Re5 Qd6  After 40...Qf3 White has a choice:  A. 41.a5 41...Qxe3 42.Rxe3 c5 (42...Kf8 43.a6) 43.Kf1 Rf4 44.Ra3 c4 45.Ra4! The pin allows White to keep his rook behind the a-pawn. His King is close to the c-pawn and White wins easily. B. 41.Rxe7 Qd1+ (41...Rxe7 42.Qxf3; 41...Qxe3 42.Rxf7+ Kxf7 43.fxe3+-) 42.Kg2 Qd5+ 43.Kg3 Qd6+ 44.Qe5+ Qxe5+ 45.Rxe5 Ra7 46.a5 Kf6 47.f4+-) 41.a5 Qd1+ 42.Kg2 Qa1 43.Qe2! e6 44.a6! Qd4 Black cannot win the a-pawn, since he gets mated: 44...Ra7 45.Rxe6 Qxa6 (45...Rxa6 46.Re7+ Kh8 47.Qe6 Ra8 48.Qf7 mates soon.) 46.Qe5+ Kh6 47.Qf4+ Kg7 48.Qf6+ Kh6 49.Qf8+ Kg5 50.f4+ Kh4 51.Qh6 mate. 45.Rxe6 c5 46.Re7! The a-pawn is faster in the queen endgame.  46...Qd5+ 47.f3 c4 48.Rxf7+ Qxf7  After 48...Kxf7 49.Qa2! a nice double-pin along the diagonal a2-g8, forcing the black queen to the a8-square. 49...Ke7 50.a7 Qa8 51.Qb2 g5 52.Qe5+ Kf7 53.Qe4! and White queens. 53...Qxa7 54.Qxh7+ wins.  49.Qe5+ Kh6  White wins after 49...Kg8 50.Qc5; or 50.Qb8+ Kg7 51.a7 Qd5 52.a8Q Qd2+ 53.Kg3 Qe1+ 54.Kf4 and there is no perpetual check. 50.Qe3+ Kg7 51.Qd4+ Kh6 52.a7 Qb7 53.h4  Threatening 54.g5+ Kh5 55.Qg4 mate.  Black resigned. Rule 2 - Don't lose matches and gamesIn 1986 in Dubai, the United States beat the Soviets. After three draws, Garry Kasparov had a better chances, but his awkward winning attempt backfired and he lost to Yasser Seirawan. But my loss to England's Nigel Short and Yasser's last round loss to Bulgaria's Kiril Georgiev had more impact on the final outcome. Although we were leading going into the last round, we ended up with the bronze medals.Wesley So also didn't lose any games in Baku and with his win with the black pieces against Ian Nepomniachtchti secured an important tie against Russia. His opponent won the first seven games, but Wesley didn't give him any chances.Nepomniachtchi,Ian (2740) - So,Wesley (2782) 42nd Olympiad, Baku 20161.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.0-0 Nf6 5.d3 0-0 6.a4 d6 7.c3 a6 8.h3  Preventing the pin Bc8-g4, but the pawn can later become a target. 8...Ba7 9.Re1 Ne7 10.d4 Ng6 11.Bd3 c6  A flexible move So might have discussed with Caruana before the game.  12.Be3 Nh5 13.Nbd2 Nhf4 14.Bf1 exd4  After establishing his knight on f4, So changes the dynamics in the center.  15.Bxd4 Bxd4 16.cxd4 d5 17.e5 f6  Opening the f-file.  18.Ra3  Wesley expected the queenside blockade 18.a5.  18...fxe5 19.dxe5  19.Nxe5 Nxe5 20.Rxe5 at least opens the third rank for the other rook.  19...a5!

The black pieces are flooding the kingside and White cannot attack any weaknesses. Nepomniachtchi should have tried 23.Nxe6 Bxe6 24.g3 Rf7 25.f4, although after 25...Raf8 Black threatens to break through with a knight sacrifice, for example 26.Qd1 Nxf4 27.gxf4 Rxf4 with a good compensation.  23...Rxf5 24.Bd3  After 24.Nf3 Raf8 Black is ready to strike.  24...Rf4 25.Bxg6 hxg6  Wesley takes over control of the game and his positional pressure is mounting.  26.Qd1 Raf8 27.Rf3 Qb4 28.Rxf4 Rxf4 29.Nf3  29.Qc2 could be met by 29...Qc5 30.Qxc5 Nxc5 31.b3 Kf7 and Black will soon pick up some pawns.  29...Qxa4  This is the first bonus, devoid of danger. A frustrating position for White. Wesley converts it slowly into a win.  30.Qd3 Rf5  30...Re4 is the other way to go.  31.Qb1 Qf4 32.Qc2 Kh7 33.Re3 Qc4 34.Qd1  34.Qxc4 dxc4 35.Ra3 b6 does not bring White relief.  34...Rf4 35.Rc3 Qb4 36.Qc1 a4 37.h4 Kg8 38.Qb1 Qe4 39.Qd1 Nd4 40.Re3 Nxf3+ 41.gxf3  41.Rxf3 Rxf3 42.gxf3 Qxe5 is hopeless.  41...Qf5 42.e6 Rxh4 43.Re4!?  A hustler's try. After 43.e7 the mate is stronger than the Queen. So calculated: 43...Qh3! 44.e8Q+ Kh7 45.Qxg6+ Kxg6 46.Qc2+ Kf7-+;  After 43.f4 Black can block the e-pawn with the King: 43...Kf8 since 44.Qxa4? Qb1+ mates. 43...Rxe4  43...Rh6! 44.Rg4 Qh5 45.Kf1 Qxg4! 46.fxg4 Rh1+ wins faster.  44.fxe4 Qxe4  The feast will be over soon.  45.Qd2 Qxe6 46.Qa5 Qg4+ 47.Kf1 b5 48.Qc7 g5 49.Qb8+ Kh7 50.Qd6 b4 White resigned. Rule 3 - Be luckyIncredibly, the first two rules didn't help in Baku. As in Haifa other teams decided who got the gold. In 1976, we spent several excruciating hours in the lobby of the Dan Carmel hotel, where the Haifa Olympiad took place. The Dutch team needed IM Franc Kuijpers to beat the Finnish master Ilkka Saaren to clinch first place on a tiebreak, but after 14 hours and 111 moves the game was drawn. The final position in the game Kuijpers-Saaren.This position didn't change much in the last 30 moves. Kuijpers gave up trying and we won the gold. In Baku, the top medals were decided by a ""byzantine"" tiebreak, as Donaldson put it. It turned out that a tie between Estonia and Germany would give the gold to Ukraine. And it was headed that way, except for one wrong check. Bluebaum,Matthias Germany - Seeman,Tarvo Estonia 42nd Olympiad Baku 2016This position appeared in the game for the second time and Black again gave the wrong check.  59...Qc1+?  A draw is achieved by 59...Qc3+!, for example:  A. 60.Bd3? Qe1+ 61.Kf4 (61.Kd4 Qg1+-+) 61...Qg3+ 62.Ke3 Qg1+-+;  B. 60.Kf4 Qf6+ 61.Ke3= (61.Kg4? Qe5 62.f4 (62.Kxh4 Qf4#) 62...Qh5#) ;  C. 60.Kf2 Qc2+ 61.Be2 Qc7=  60.Kd3!  Bluebaum finally begins the victorious king-walk, securing the gold for the Americans. He played Ke3-f2 at first, but the white King needs to escape checks, marching forward via the queenside.  60...Qd1+ 61.Kc4 Qf1+ 62.Kb3 Qd1+ 63.Kb2  The journey to the sixth rank starts with a retreat.  63...Qd2+ 64.Ka3 Qc3+ 65.Ka4 Qc7  Or 65...Qa1+ 66.Kb5 Qf1+ (66...Qe5 67.Qc5+-) 67.Kc6 Qc1+ 68.Qc5+-  66.Qc5 Qh2  66...Rxb7 67.Bxb7 Qxb7 68.Qc6 wins easily.  67.Ka5 Kg7 68.Kb6 Qxh3 69.Qc7 Rxb7+ 70.Bxb7 Qxf3 71.d6 h3 72.e5 Qf4 Black resigned.Before leaving the Chess Olympiad in Baku several chessplayers created their version of John Lennon's song Imagine.Carlsen vs. Caruana next ThursdayThe world chess champion Magnus Carlsen and the current U.S. champion Fabiano Caruana, who led the U.S. team to gold medals at the recent Chess Olympiad in Baku, will compete in a ""tag-team"" match at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, NJ (222 Jersey City Blvd.) on Thursday, Sept. 22 from 10:30 am till noon. Caruana and a designated player will challenge Carlsen and his teammate in a sort of chess doubles. Carlsen will also play a simo against 13 opponents, qualified via PlayMagnus app. Paul Hoffman, president and CEO of LSC, will comment on the play. It will be live-streamed via Norwegian TV. Both players believe that chess can have an impact on STEM education, favored by the Center.Note that in the replay windows below you can click either on the arrows under the diagram or on the notation to follow the game.

It was clear from the outset that Germany had to assume responsibility in the crisis, and so we did.The refugee crisis is highly complex and there is no single lever we can pull, no magic wand we can wave in order to solve it. Instead, we have to work continuously on many different levels. There are the root causes, such as the civil war in Syria or the often desperate situation in some African countries; there are joint European efforts to address the crisis; and there is the situation on the ground in Germany itself. Overall, I think, the circumstances have much improved since last September, when the refugees began arriving in Germany.Addressing the root causes is probably by far the hardest part of solving the refugee crisis. In Syria, the fragile ceasefire, mainly brokered by the U.S., might provide a new opportunity for the Syrian people, although caution is advised. At a donor conference in London this year, the international community raised $11 billion in humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees residing in, among other places, Jordan and Lebanon. Germany pledged $2.5 billion at that conference.On the European level, solidarity among the member states is still not as strong as we would like it to be, but Germany will continue to press for more cooperation within the EU. A central part of the EU effort has been the refugee agreement with Turkey, which has significantly brought down the numbers of refugees arriving in Europe. The EU has now particularly focused on the situation in Africa. It has established a close cooperation on migration issues with Niger, a country through which 90 percent of the refugees boarding boats in Libya pass. The European border protection agency, Frontex, has been completely reformed over the last year and can now help protect the EU's external borders much more effectively.Germany took in 1.1 million refugees in 2015. This has been a great challenge, but Germany has lived up to it and the situation has improved on many levels compared with one year ago:Asylum procedures have been expedited. This August, Germany adjudicated the applications of 57,000 people, more than three times the number as in August of last year. Hundreds of additional employees were hired to process applications more swiftly.Contrary to what some populists claim, the security situation in Germany remains stable as well. Crimes committed by migrants dropped by more than 36 percent between January and June of 2016. And many of the crimes were more of the petty sort, such as attempting to ride a train or bus without a ticket. The crime rate is especially low among refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, the countries from which most new refugees in Germany come.The main challenge, of course, remains integration - this is why Germany is now providing courses for refugees to help them integrate into society, learn the German language, and find employment. At the same time, refusal to join integration courses will lead to cuts in benefits for refugees.Overall, we have achieved a lot in the last 12 months - internationally, on a European level, and in Germany itself. But the refugee crisis is far from over and still needs enormous efforts. Germany will continue to stand by its commitment and do its share, internationally, in Europe, and at home, because it is our humanitarian obligation to do so.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post to mark the occasion of two critical conferences at the UN on the Refugee and Migrant crisis: the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants (Sept. 19th, a UN conference) and the Leaders Summit on Refugees (Sept. 20th, hosted by U.S. Pres. Barack Obama, at the UN). To see all the posts in the series, visit here. To follow the conversation on Twitter, see #UN4RefugeesMigrants."

Pushing late into the night is a health and productivity killer.The short-term productivity gains from skipping sleep to work are quickly washed away by the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on your mood, ability to focus, emotional intelligence, and access to higher-level brain functions for days to come. The negative effects of sleep deprivation are so great that people who are drunk outperform those lacking sleep.Why You Need Adequate Sleep to PerformWe've always known that sleep is good for your brain, but new research from the University of Rochester provides the first direct evidence for why your brain cells need you to sleep (and sleep the right way--more on that later). The study found that when you sleep your brain removes toxic proteins from its neurons that are by-products of neural activity when you're awake. Unfortunately, your brain can remove them adequately only while you're asleep. So when you don't get enough sleep, the toxic proteins remain in your brain cells, wreaking havoc by impairing your ability to think--something no amount of caffeine can fix.Skipping sleep impairs your brain function across the board. It slows your ability to process information and problem solve, kills your creativity, and catapults your stress levels and emotional reactivity.What Sleep Deprivation Does to Your HealthSleep deprivation is linked to a variety of serious health problems, including heart attack, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. It stresses you out because your body overproduces the stress hormone cortisol when it's sleep deprived. While excess cortisol has a host of negative health effects that come from the havoc it wreaks on your immune system, it also makes you look older, because cortisol breaks down skin collagen, the protein that keeps skin smooth and elastic. In men specifically, not sleeping enough reduces testosterone levels and lowers sperm count.People who get enough sleep live longer, healthier lives, but I understand that sometimes this isn't motivation enough. So consider this--not sleeping enough makes you fat. Sleep deprivation compromises your body's ability to metabolize carbohydrates and control food intake. When you sleep less you eat more and have more difficulty burning the calories you consume. Sleep deprivation makes you hungrier by increasing the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin and makes it harder for you to get full by reducing levels of the satiety-inducing hormone leptin. People who sleep less than 6 hours a night are 30% more likely to become obese than those who sleep 7 to 9 hours a night.  How Much Sleep Is Enough?Most people need 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night to feel sufficiently rested. Few people are at their best with less than 7 hours, and few require more than 9 without an underlying health condition. And that's a major problem, since more than half of Americans get less than the necessary 7 hours of sleep each night, according to the National Sleep Foundation.  Doing Something about ItBeyond the obvious sleep benefits of thinking clearly and staying healthy, the ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we've found that 90% of top performers are high in emotional intelligence (EQ). These individuals are skilled at understanding and using emotions to their benefit, and good sleep hygiene is one of the greatest tools at their disposal.High-EQ individuals know it's not just how much you sleep that matters, but also how you sleep. When life gets in the way of getting the amount of sleep you need, it's absolutely essential that you increase the quality of your sleep through good sleep hygiene. There are many hidden killers of quality sleep. The 10 strategies that follow will help you identify these killers and clean up your sleep hygiene. Follow them, and you'll reap the performance and health benefits that come with getting the right quantity and quality of sleep.1. Stay Away from Sleeping PillsWhen I say sleeping pills, I mean anything you take that sedates you so that you can sleep. Whether it's alcohol, Nyquil, Benadryl, Valium, Ambien, or what have you, these substances greatly disrupt your brain's natural sleep process. Have you ever noticed that sedatives can give you some really strange dreams? As you sleep and your brain removes harmful toxins, it cycles through an elaborate series of stages, at times shuffling through the day's memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams). Sedation interferes with these cycles, altering the brain's natural process.Anything that interferes with the brain's natural sleep process has dire consequences for the quality of your sleep. Many of the strategies that follow eliminate factors that disrupt this recovery process. If getting off sleeping pills proves difficult, make certain you try some of the other strategies (such as cutting down on caffeine) that will make it easier for you to fall asleep naturally and reduce your dependence upon sedatives.2. Stop Drinking Caffeine (at Least after Lunch)You can sleep more and vastly improve the quality of the sleep you get by reducing your caffeine intake. Caffeine is a powerful stimulant that interferes with sleep by increasing adrenaline production and blocking sleep-inducing chemicals in the brain. Caffeine has a 6-hour half-life, which means it takes a full 24 hours to work its way out of your system. Have a cup of joe at 8 a.m., and you'll still have 25% of the caffeine in your body at 8 p.m. Anything you drink after noon will still be near 50% strength at bedtime. Any caffeine in your bloodstream--the negative effects increasing with the dose--makes it harder to fall and stay asleep.When you do finally fall asleep, the worst is yet to come. Caffeine disrupts the quality of your sleep by reducing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the deep sleep when your body recuperates most. When caffeine disrupts your sleep, you wake up the next day with a cognitive and emotional handicap. You'll be naturally inclined to grab a cup of coffee or an energy drink to try to make yourself feel more alert, which very quickly creates a vicious cycle.3. Avoid Blue Light at NightThis is a big one--most people don't even realize it impacts their sleep. Short-wavelength blue light plays an important role in your mood, energy level, and sleep quality. In the morning, sunlight contains high concentrations of this ""blue"" light. When your eyes are exposed to it directly (not through a window or while wearing sunglasses), the blue light halts production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin and makes you feel more alert. This is great, and exposure to a.m. sunlight can improve your mood and energy levels. If the sun isn't an option for you, try a blue light device.In the afternoon, the sun's rays lose their blue light, which allows your body to produce melatonin and start making you sleepy. By the evening, your brain does not expect any blue light exposure and is very sensitive to it. The problem this creates for sleep is that most of our favorite evening devices--laptops, tablets, televisions, and mobile phones--emit short-wavelength blue light. And in the case of your laptop, tablet, and phone, they do so brightly and right in your face. This exposure impairs melatonin production and interferes with your ability to fall asleep as well as with the quality of your sleep once you do nod off. Remember, the sleep cycle is a daylong process for your brain. When you confuse your brain by exposing it in the evening to what it thinks is a.m. sunlight, this derails the entire process with effects that linger long after you power down. The best thing you can do is avoid these devices after dinner (television is okay for most people as long as they sit far enough away from the set). If you must use one of these devices in the evening, you can limit your exposure with a filter or protective eye wear.4. Wake Up at the Same Time Every DayConsistency is key to a good night's sleep, especially when it comes to waking up. Waking up at the same time every day improves your mood and sleep quality by regulating your circadian rhythm. When you have a consistent wake-up time, your brain acclimates to this and moves through the sleep cycle in preparation for you to feel rested and alert at your wake-up time. Roughly an hour before you wake, hormone levels increase gradually (along with your body temperature and blood pressure), causing you to become more alert. This is why you'll often find yourself waking up right before your alarm goes off.When you don't wake up at the same time every day, your brain doesn't know when to complete the sleep process and when it should prepare you to be awake. Long ago, sunlight ensured a consistent wake-up time. These days, an alarm is the only way most people can pull this off, and doing this successfully requires resisting the temptation to sleep in when you're feeling tired because you know you'll actually feel better by keeping your wake-up time in tact.  5. No Binge Sleeping (In) on the WeekendSleeping in on the weekend is a counterproductive way to catch up on your sleep. It messes with your circadian rhythm by giving you an inconsistent wake-up time. When you wake up at the same time during the work week but sleep past this time on the weekend, you end up feeling groggy and tired because your brain hasn't prepared your body to be awake. This isn't a big deal on your day off, but it makes you less productive on Monday because it throws your cycle off and makes it hard to get going again on your regular schedule.  6. Learn How Much Sleep You Really NeedThe amount of sleep you need is something that you can't control, and scientists are beginning to discover the genes that dictate it. The problem is, most people sleep much less than they really need and are under-performing because they think they're getting enough. Some discover this the hard way. Ariana Huffington was one of those frantic types who underslept and overworked, until she collapsed unexpectedly from exhaustion one afternoon. She credits her success and well-being since then to the changes she's made to her sleep habits. ""I began getting 30 minutes more sleep a night, until gradually I got to 7 to 8 hours. The result has been transformational,"" Huffington says, adding that, ""all the science now demonstrates unequivocally that when we get enough sleep, everything is better: our health; our mental capacity and clarity; our joy at life; and our ability to live life without reacting to every bad thing that happens.""Huffington isn't the only one. Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, and Sheryl Sandberg have all touted the virtues of getting enough sleep. Even Bill Gates, an infamous night owl, has affirmed the benefits of figuring out how much sleep you really need: ""I like to get 7 hours of sleep a night because that's what I need to stay sharp and creative and upbeat."" It's time to bite the bullet and start going to bed earlier until you find the magic number that enables you to perform at your best.7. Stop WorkingWhen you work in the evening, it puts you into a stimulated, alert state when you should be winding down and relaxing in preparation for sleep. Recent surveys show that roughly 60% of people monitor their smartphones for work emails until they go to sleep. Staying off blue light-emitting devices (discussed above) after a certain time each evening is also a great way to avoid working so you can relax and prepare for sleep, but any type of work before bed should be avoided if you want quality sleep.8. Eliminate InterruptionsUnfortunately for those with small children, the quality of your sleep does suffer when it is interrupted. The key here is to eliminate all the interruptions that are under your control. If you have loud neighbors, wear earplugs to bed. If your mother likes to call at all hours of the night, make certain you silence your ringer before you go to bed. If you had to wake up extra early in the morning, make sure your alarm clock is back on its regular time when you go to bed. Don't drink too much water in the evening to avoid a bathroom trip in the middle of the night. If your partner snores . . . well, you get the idea. If you think hard enough, there are lots of little things you can do to eliminate unnecessary interruptions to your sleep.  9. Learn to MeditateMany people who learn to meditate report that it improves the quality of their sleep and that they can get the rest they need even if they aren't able to significantly increase the number of hours they sleep. At the Stanford Medical Center, insomniacs participated in a 6-week mindfulness meditation and cognitive-behavioral therapy course. At the end of the study, participants' average time to fall asleep was cut in half (from 40 to 20 minutes), and 60% of subjects no longer qualified as insomniacs. The subjects retained these gains upon follow-up a full year later. A similar study at the University of Massachusetts Medical School found that 91% of participants either reduced the amount of medication they needed to sleep or stopped taking medication entirely after a mindfulness and sleep therapy course. Give mindfulness a try. At minimum, you'll fall asleep faster, as it will teach you how to relax and quiet your mind once you hit the pillow.  10. When All Else Fails: Take NapsOne of the biggest peaks in melatonin production happens during the 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. time frame, which explains why most people feel sleepy in the afternoon. Companies like Google and Zappos are capitalizing on this need by giving employees the opportunity to take short afternoon naps. If you aren't getting enough sleep at night, you're likely going to feel an overwhelming desire to sleep in the afternoon. When this happens, you're better off taking a short nap (even as short as 15 minutes) than resorting to caffeine to keep you awake. A short nap will give you the rest you need to get through the rest of the afternoon, and you'll sleep much better in the evening than if you drink caffeine or take a long afternoon nap.Bringing It All TogetherI know many of you reading this piece are thinking something along the lines of ""but I know a guy (or gal) who is always up at all hours of the night working or socializing, and he's the number one performer at our branch."" My answer for you is simple: this guy is underperforming. We all have innate abilities that we must maximize to reach our full potential. My job is to help people do that--to help the good become great by removing unseen performance barriers. Being number one in your branch is an accomplishment, but I guarantee that this guy has his sights set on bigger things that he isn't achieving because sleep deprivation has him performing at a fraction of his full potential. You should send him this article. It just might shake something loose.After all, the only thing worth catching up on at night is your sleep."

Added to this, Congress overwhelming passed legislation allowing the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia for damages. The icing on cake is the agreement reached between the Obama Administration and Israel guaranteeing Israel $38 Billion in military assistance program over the next 10 years.   Individually, these stories are confounding, collectively they are appalling.   After Hillary Clinton fainted while leaving a 9/11 memorial event, it was revealed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia a few days earlier and would, therefore, stay off the campaign trail for a few days until she regained her strength. Because Clinton hadn't made public her illness, until after the fainting spell, the press pounced on her denouncing penchant for privacy, secrecy, and whatever.   Now that charge has some merit and is reflected in polling which shows that Clinton is not seen as honest and trustworthy by a majority of American voters. This trust issue continues to plague Clinton and is, to some degree, responsible for her declining poll numbers. While that may be understandable, what is impossible to comprehend is how Trump becomes the beneficiary of her slide. The Republican nominee is, by far, the most dishonest, least transparent candidate to ever run for president. The health records he has revealed are a joke. He continues to withhold his tax returns. His business dealings are, at best, shady. And we now know that his much touted ""charitable giving"" is a scam--since many of the donations he claimed to have made were more often than not contributions that others funneled through him. Given Trump's record of dishonesty, his appeals to bigotry, the contradictory nature of the positions he has taken on critical issues, and his lack of experience in governance, how can one reasonably explain the fact that none of this seems to matter to the 42 or so percent of the electorate who say they would choose him as president over a person, who for all her flaws is without a doubt the most qualified candidate in the field. I have written extensively about ""Trumpism"" and the anger, fear, and deep trauma of the group of voters who propelled Trump onto the national stage. But I assumed that the majority of the American electorate would ultimately reject him. I can still hope (and work) that they will. That this race is tied is both confusing and worrisome. I shouldn't have been stunned when Congress passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). But I was. Congress frequently considers bills that are baseless, outrageous, and/or just plain dangerous. Because these efforts are often motivated by crass politics, they usually die as saner minds prevail.   In proposing this bill, Congress was preying on the deep residual pain resulting from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The legislation is premised on the notion that there was direct Arab governmental role in the attacks, despite the findings of the 9/11 Commission to the contrary. In fact, it is only because of the persistence of deep anti-Arab sentiment that some Members of Congress continued to advance the bill. By passing it and sending it to the President they are putting at risk US relations with important Arab allies and they are opening the door for other countries to pass similar legislation that could hold the US or Israel (with US support) accountable for their actions in the Middle East. While Congress often sees Arabs as soft targets that can be attacked with impunity, this legislation is clearly a step too far. Just as I assumed, that it would not pass, I am assuming that the Obama Administration will veto it and that his veto will not be overridden by Congress. Given the unpredictable climate, I am no longer sure of anything. The icing on the cake was the conclusion of a monumental disaster of an agreement--the 10 year, commitment to a $38 Billion military assistance package for Israel. Even though I understand politics--who has clout and who does not--this aid package is inexplicable and even dangerous. It rewards Netanyahu's efforts to sabotage the President's Iran Deal and his blocking of any movement toward Israeli-Palestinian peace. And it takes away any leverage the US may have had to restrain Israel's unconscionable behavior in the occupied territories. One would have thought that this President, after more than seven years of dealing with Netanyahu, has learned that by rewarding bad behavior he only enables it--allowing the Israeli leader to act with impunity.   If this were not troubling enough, the Administration's lame statement, accompanying the announcement of the deal, still advocating for two-states (which Netanyahu's policies have now buried) and decrying continued settlement expansion (which Israel routinely ignores), was embarrassing. And what I found deeply troubling was the statement that this massive demonstration of ""unprecedented support for Israel's security"" was being touted as part of this White House's proud legacy--a far cry, indeed, from the Middle East goals they had established seven years ago.All of this, defies reasonable explanation. That it all happened in a week (together, I might add, with the US/Russian ""Syrian peace deal"", that provides neither ""peace"" nor a ""deal"") left me stymied. Follow @jjz1600 for more. "

Being one of the greatest divas to find success in the 1980s, the ""I Think We're Alone Now"" singer was excited to return to the city that never sleeps for her ""A Million Miles"" tour. ""Tonight was really good. The show was awesome,"" she said. She continued, ""Hearing everyone sing with me on songs like 'Hold An Old Friends Hand.' Every show has been different. Somebody might scream out 'Johnny's Got The Inside Moves'. We try our best. 28 years of music is hard to fit into 90 minutes. So I picked out the highlights that I thought showed off all the old albums and of course putting a focus on the new album as well. I also got to do the old school stuff too. And if I need to change it up a little bit? I do. My poor band is always on the fly. It's fun and that's what makes it spontaneous. No one has gotten the same show this entire tour. I think that's the cool thing about it and I would like to keep it going. I think tonight had some magical moments. 'Could've Been' and 'Hold An Old Friends Hand.' Just hearing everyone sing with me. 'Here In My Heart' sounded amazing. That's a song where I have to focus a little bit because it is definitely a singer's song. I'm very proud to have that in my repertoire and just kind of be able to sing it. Just to let everything go and show people how much I love to sing."" Tiffany proved she loved singing that night by putting together an epic showcase that covered her entire career from her humble beginnings to the present day. Throughout her energetic performance, Tiffany found herself going into the crowd. When asked why she did that, she told me, ""I had to create the energy. I hate that hole. I like it when people are closer to me because I don't feel that gap."" She smiled and went on to say, ""I feel that sometimes the gap between the audience and the stage makes the energy die. So I kind of go into panic mode a little bit. I love touching people. I love shaking their hands and singing with them and being able to work with them throughout the show. So if I can't have that I really do panic a little bit. It sets me off balance."" Tiffany showed no signs of panic as the audience was with her the whole night. Longtime fans of Tiffany were impressed with how effortlessly she carried herself on stage while never losing a step along the way. ""I think this is so personal. It really is intimate and organic. Maybe people don't expect that from me as a performer,"" she told me. She went on to say, ""I am kind of drawing you into my world. I am a true musician. I bring great musicians with me. We just have a blast. This show has all the polishing elements of a professional show of course but It also has the elements of what I love to do at home. Which is to jam with my musician friends and just have a good time. And to try things and have fun and cut up and just love music. So if we really feel that if the audience can be milked a little bit and have a good time, we will extend stuff on the fly. We really are creating on the spot as well as having a planned out element. That is what I love about the live aspect and that really is me as a live performer. I really like to tailor-make everything for the audience."" The audience left the Gramercy Theatre that evening chatting among themselves discussing how it was one of the greatest concerts that they have ever been to. Photo Credit: Kevin Jackson Jr. (undertheshutter.blogspot.com)Tiffany has seemingly done it all. From being a megastar in the music business to a competitor on Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling back in 2008. She remembered her time in the squared circle as an eyeopening experience. She told me, ""The cast in itself was a lot of fun. Learning the moves and practicing was crazy. Being thrown on the floor and on the mat is something to be taken seriously. We were really learning the moves and there were times where someone did the stunt a little wrong. They felt it the next day. They feel that smack so you have to be careful. I've always been a big wrestling fan growing up. Rowdy Roddy Piper was my ultimate all time favorite wrestler. You have a newfound respect for the craft after an experience like that. There is an art to it. It really is a professional sport. Going through it I was like 'Oh, you just can't wing it.'"" That wasn't the only occasion that Tiffany appeared on television. How I Met Your Mother fans still talk about the legen, wait for it, dary episode where Tiffany appeared as a backup singer in an 1980s-inspired pop star music video that starred Robin Sparkles. When recalling her cameo on the show, Tiffany laughed, ""Primping my hair was something else. I wasn't thrilled about. I never looked good in primped hair but I went for it anyway. Not a good look for Tiffany.""Tiffany is in a place where things are looking good for her career. In recent years, she has become friends with one time rival Debbie Gibson. In a Huffington Post exclusive, she told me, ""That's the whole thing. Now we have the Tiff Heads and the Deb Heads. We have such a fanbase together. We have really meshed our worlds together. People don't feel like they have to pick one or the other which is a nice place to be. Our fans really did embrace both of us. We are friends. Sometimes I'll throw Debbie Gibson in there when I'm talking about something because it's so natural to be honest with you. And our fans really do love us both. We've come to terms with that and we think it's pretty fabulous."" In another fabulous Tiffany moment, when asked what her top five 1980s movies are, she said without missing a beat, ""The Breakfast Club. The Breakfast Club. The Breakfast Club. The Breakfast Club. The Breakfast Club. That's my all time favorite."" Always leaving people smiling, it is no surprise why Tiffany has such devoted fans 28 years later.Tiffany is very excited for the future. She is most likely coming to a city near you to show the world that she is still one of the best vocalists in the industry. ""We are really taking on bookings until the middle of next year. It's a big year. A year and a half of live performing. I love it,"" she said. Confidently, she told me, ""I've got a great crew of people and we are having a blast. We are reconnecting with the fans and making new fans along the way. I just love to see this new show get on its legs and get up and running. It is a turning page for me. It takes a lot of attention to sit and watch a stripped-down live performance. This tour is much more for the person who loves the entertainer part of it. You're not just going to hear a live band and retro stuff. You are going to be engaged into the music. This is groundbreaking for me because it is for people who love singer-songwriters, true performers and people who love that organic effect. That's what we are doing here. I'm excited to break that new ground.""If you want to see Tiffany break new ground, you can check out her touring schedule on her website. You can also follow her on Twitter and Facebook."

The answer lies in finance and economics, namely JOBS!!",2016-09-17,"BRUNSWICK, ME - JANUARY 26: Pieces of broccoli sit on a cutting board in the Brunswick kitchen of Christine Burns Rudalevige (cq) before she makes a broccoli stem and stilton soup for the Green Plate Special Tuesday, January 26, 2016. (Photo by Gabe Souza/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb108432100006401c71498.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Proverb: Give a man a fish he eats for a day. Teach a man how to fish and he eats for a lifetime. Many might think; this passage is straight from the bible or an ancient Chinese proverb, in fact it is neither. The proverb was actually coined by Anne Isabella Ritchie during the 1880's in a story she wrote titled Mrs. Dymond.  Its relevancy however seems so important today as we face alarming rates of poverty, homelessness and food insecurity. According to the United States statistics on hunger 45 million people fall into this category, which translates into 14% of the population. 19% are children, 8% senior.  Millions and millions of dollars are spent each year on hunger relief programs and organizations aimed at feeding the poor. Yet, as the economy grows it seems the rich continue to get rich and the poor, poorer while the middle class remains stagnant. I want to know do we really target the root cause of hunger?  When we talk about poverty, do we just talk about ways of ending it or do we have financial and economic programs and resources in place to deal with the problem?  As a person and farmer living in a low- income neighborhood the cost and the value of food comes into question. Each year in low -income neighborhoods across this country, money is put into programs and nonprofit organizations such as food pantries and soup kitchens to combat hunger. Granted, they offer tremendous help and support in feeding the needy. However; does charity in its greatest form really help to stem the tide of hunger and poverty? When people are constantly given free food at no cost, do we then devalue the true cost of food? These are questions I keep asking myself. As a farmer, I am up against such programs that have people to believe that my organically grown produce is too pricey or expensive. Heck, the fact that they can get a flat of strawberries or tomatoes free and I am asking them to pay for a pint or a pound of the same item does not make sense. For too long, the hunger and emergency food programs which were meant to be short-term solutions have become for some a way of life. In my neighborhood you can get free food each day from a local food pantry and or soup kitchen. It might not be the healthiest but it's there. People in low- income neighborhood have been institutionalized into thinking that free food is part of the system. It is a food system that has plagued our neighborhood with cheap food, fast food, junk food and processed food. Having us to believe that this is our way of eating, a way of life which is unacceptable. This brings me back to the real cost and value of food.  If you look at the real cost of food in my neighborhood you can see that it is associated with the high cost of diet-related diseases. Hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity and heart disease are leading the way to the high cost of health care. A health system of ongoing treatment in the long run is not sustainable. As for the value of food; marketing and advertisement is at its core. When we have people placing more value on buying a new pair of $200 sneakers verses the cost of a $2 freshly grown bunch of carrots. I have a problem with that. When someone can find $25 to put more minutes on his or her cellphone but question the fact that my $2/lb. collards are expensive. I again have a problem with that. When we have people placing more value on materialistic things rather than on food and water. I have a problem with that and I am angry. Somewhere, somehow, companies are making money on the backs of the poor and infirm and that money is not being re-invested in our communities.So how can we get from under this paradigm of the real cost and value of food? It goes back to hunger and poverty and the proverb stated by Ms. Ritchie. The answer lies in finance and economics, namely JOBS!!Imagine in low-income communities, with technology and businesses coming in and training people to run and manage their own enterprises. Imagine how it would look for folks to be paid a living wage job so that they can save and invest, buy a home or pay rent, send their children to the best school and finally being able to pay for healthy nutritious food. Why do we have to imagine it? Let's just do it! We have the resources, we have the technology and we have the people wanting the opportunity to get from under poverty and provide for their families.I know the answer may sound simplistic, but I do dare to dream and I dream big. If we continue to feed the poor without the ability to give them the financial resources needed to be self sufficient we fail, but if given the opportunity to have them own a business, or a living wage job we succeed. The fight against poverty and ending hunger will never be won with a handout; rather, it can be won through financial and economic self-sufficiency and determination.

33,WORLDPOST,The New Syrian Ceasefire is a Strategic Defeat for the United States,"Joseph V. Micallef, ContributorBest Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Key...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-new-syrian-ceasefire_b_12037056.html,,2016-09-17,2016-09-16-1474031414-833498-JordanianRefugeeCamp.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-16-1474031414-833498-JordanianRefugeeCamp-thumb.jpg,"US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Ministeer Sergey Lavrov announcing a new Syrian cease fire, Geneva, September 9, 2016 Phote courtesy US Dept. of StateOn September 9, 2016, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that the United States and Russia had reached an agreement for a new 48-hour ceasefire in the Syrian Civil War. Ostensibly, the purpose of the ceasefire is to enable aid convoys from Turkey to bring badly needed supplies to the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo. Some 250,000 people in rebel held areas of Aleppo have been cut off since July 2016.The agreement is to be renewed every 48 hours, providing that it holds. After a week the U.S. and Russian air forces are supposed to expand their cooperation and stage joint air attacks against Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front. During this period the U.S. is responsible for identifying the locations of the U.S. backed ""moderate rebel groups"" and separating them from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham militants.This was the second agreement brokered by the U.S. and Russia. An earlier agreement announced on February 22, 2016, proved short lived. It is unlikely that the second agreement will be any more successful. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has already announced that ""the Syrian state is determined to recapture every area from the terrorists.""Since it broke out in 2011, the Syrian Civil War has claimed approximately 500,000 lives, though no one is completely sure what the actual number is. An additional five million people, roughly one-quarter of Syria's prewar population, has been displaced and are now refugees. An additional 6.6 million have been internally displaced within Syria. Roughly one million refugees have requested political asylum in Europe.While efforts to end the violence and find a political solution to Syria's Civil War is laudatory; this ceasefire will do neither. Instead it represents yet another strategic defeat for the United States, one more in what has been a long line of diplomatic defeats in Syria. In the meantime, the Obama administration has allowed both Russia and Turkey to manipulate U.S. policy for their own ends.Syrian refugee camp in Zaatari Jordan The U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War was prompted by the battlefield successes of the Islamic State (IS) and the rise of the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Nusra Front, as well as the emergence of other radical jihadist groups. American military intervention was part of a broad coalition of about a dozen countries, including some NATO members, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies, as well as Jordan and Turkey. Although the amount of air power unleashed was formidable, its effectiveness for the first two years of the campaign was constrained by rules of engagement so restrictive that only one out of four missions actually attacked its intended target.While the White House declared on numerous occasions that Bashar al-Assad was an obstacle to a lasting peace on Syria, and even went so far as to declare that the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons would be a ""red line"" in Washington's relations with Damascus, the Obama administration made no serious effort to actually replace the Assad regime and conveniently forgot about its red line.It was clear from the beginning of the American intervention, that while American and coalition air power could help to contain the further expansion of the Islamic State, it would ultimately take boots on the ground to actually roll back IS. Accordingly, the U.S. looked to recruit, train and arm so called ""moderate rebel factions"" as American proxies in the ground war. Washington spent billions of dollars in this effort only to eventually acknowledge that the program had largely failed. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies spent even more in the same type of effort. Although their definition of ""moderate"" was more expansive than that of the United States, it included virtually everyone except for the al-Nusra Front and other extremist jihadist organizations, that effort also failed to create an anti-Assad force whose political and social agenda would have been acceptable to Western nations. The Saudi's and the Turks were successful, however, in creating broad coalitions of various jihadist rebel groups in order to better coordinate the military effort against the Assad government; give the anti-Assad forces critical mass on the battlefield and facilitate the provision of supplies and financing. There have been various coalitions that have been created and which subsequently disintegrated. The two largest groups currently are the Turkish and Qatari sponsored Ahrar-al-Sham (Islamic Movement of the Free People of the Levant) and the Saudi sponsored Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam). Ahrar al-Sham includes elements of the Free Syrian Army, the original group that launched the rebellion against the Assad government. It is the second largest rebel group in the Syrian war. Its strength is estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 fighters. Various militant groups associated with Ahrar al-Sham participated in the Turkish led invasion of north Syria in August 2016. That invasion was designed to clear out ISIS militants along the Turkish-Syrian border and more importantly, for Turkey, prevent the linkup of Syrian Kurdish forces west of the Euphrates River with those in Afrin canton further west. That linkup would have united the predominantly Kurdish areas in northern Syria. When the Turkish invasion began, Ankara demanded, and the U.S. acquiesced, that the American backed, Kurdish led, Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) immediately withdraw east of the Euphrates or they would be attacked. Disposition of forces in northern Syria as of mid-September 2016. Green is Turkish/Syrian rebel controlled zone, tan is Kurdish zone, red is Syrian government zone and black is Islamic State zone. Russia, Syria and Egypt have designated Ahrar al-Sham as a terrorist organization. Surprisingly, according to a report in the Gulf News, the United Arab Emirates, a close Saudi ally, have also designated Ahrar al-Sham as a terrorist organization. The group's stated intention is the overthrow of the Assad government and the creation of an Islamic State under Sharia law. Jaish al-Islam is the largest rebel group fighting in Syria. Its strength is estimated at between 20,000 and 25,000 militants. Unlike Ahrar-al Sham, Jaish al-Islam specifically rejects the participation of the Free Syrian Army. The group consists of about 50 different jihadist factions. There are an additional 150 to 200 other rebel groups that collaborate with Jaish al-Islam or which have, at different times, been affiliated with it. The group is largely funded by Saudi Arabia. Training programs, under Pakistani Army officers, have also been underwritten by the Saudis. Russia, Syria and Egypt have designated Jaish al-Islam as a terrorist organization. Like Ahrar al-Sham, Jaish al-Islam is committed to the overthrow of the Assad regime and to the establishment of an Islamic state under Sharia law.Neither the United States nor its European allies have formally designated either group as a terrorist organization. Both groups are predominantly Sunni Muslim-based, and both groups have denounced any kind of secular democratic government as un-Islamic and vowed to expel Shiite Muslims, including Syria's Alawite minority, from Syria. In at least one instance, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry verbally referred to both organizations as terrorist groups but a State Department spokesman later walked back his comments. Both the U.S. and various European governments have continued to try to engage both organizations and, in particular, to identify ""moderate"" elements within both organizations, which they could support.The ceasefire agreement calls for the U.S. and Russia to establish ""a joint integration center"" in Geneva, possibly as early as September 19, where American and Russian military officials could decide on ""shared targets"" and ""coordinated military strikes."" The last time Americans and Russians had such discussions was when the Army Air Force based approximately 250 B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-25 Liberator bombers and their escort fighters in three Soviet airfields in the Ukraine during World War II. As part of this ""military cooperation,"" the U.S. is tasked with separating ""moderate"" elements within both Ahrar al-Sham and Jaish al-Islam from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham militants and other radical jihadists. Given the fluidity of these organizations base of support, how readily militants switch from one organization to another, and how frequently ""opportunistic"" battlefield alliances of convenience are formed by the different jihadist organizations, the U.S. has no effective means to identify, much less verify, who are the ""good jihadists"" and who are the ""bad"" ones. Syrian Democratic Forces militia Many of the so-called ""moderate groups"" that the U.S. is trying to support also cooperate with more radical jihadist organizations, including Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, and are also part of either Ahrar al-Sham or Jaish al-Islam. The risk for the United States, is that they will be blamed for Russian attacks against American sponsored rebel groups. As one unnamed U.S. official, quoted in a Reuters news dispatch, put it, ""the Russians aren't using precision guided munitions in Syria, which gives them a perfect excuse to say, sorry, we weren't aiming for your guys.""When the Kremlin intervened in the Syrian Civil War, its principal aim was to shore up the Assad regime and to transform the ""political reality"" in Syria by making the government of Bashar al-Assad the only realistic alternative that the U.S. and its European allies could support. It has largely accomplished thisAlthough the U.S. has stopped short of declaring its support for the continuation of the Assad government, by allowing its proxies on the ground, the Kurdish led SDF in north Syria and the so-called ""moderate groups,"" to be attacked and marginalized, it has effectively accepted Bashar al-Assad as the best of the worst alternatives. More significantly, the steady Islamization and radicalization of the rebel groups means that even if the U.S. succeeds in rolling back the Islamic State, the civil war in Syria will simply continue as a conflict between the un-democratic, but secular, Russian and Iranian supported, Assad government, and one or more rebel alliances, supported by Turkey and Saudi Arabia, committed to the establishment of a theocratic Islamic state under Sharia law. Should the rebels prevail, it's possible that there will be an additional civil war between the various Sunni groups to determine who will dominate the new Islamic state, or its equally possible that the other groups will coalesce around one of the larger jihadist factions. If that group turns out to be al-Qaeda inspired, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, then the U.S. led effort in Syria will have accomplished little more than replacing the original Islamic State with a far larger, al-Qaeda linked version. The most likely scenario is a combination of the two possible outcomes: some fighting among the Sunni rebel groups while others coalesce around the strongest of those groups. Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly al-Nusra Front, fighters in SyriaThis is a no-win situation for the United States. Either it accepts the continuation of a pro-Russian and pro-Iranian regime, one that will expand Moscow's and Tehran's influence in the region and further strengthen the Iranian led, ""Shiite arc of influence"" and pit Washington against its traditional Turkish and Saudi allies, or it will find that it has conducted its military effort to destroy the Islamic State just to pave the way for the creation of another, potentially equally dangerous, Sharia-based Islamic state. It is not a foregone conclusion that such a state would be anti-Western in its orientation. It depends on which of the rebel groups ultimately ends up controlling the new government. It certainly won't be pro-Western. At best, it might prove to be neutral or ideologically anti-Western, but not violently so. The odds, however, make it more likely that it will be militantly anti-Western than not. The legacy of five years of the Obama administration's Syrian policy is that it has severely damaged American credibility in the region. The willingness with which it has abandoned its proxies in the Syrian ground war will not be easily forgotten neither will the complete ineffectiveness of its foreign policy in Syria. The United States remains the world's only superpower. In the Syrian Civil War, however, the White House has allowed Russia and Turkey to manipulate it for their own ends, and in the process financed a war whose ultimate outcomes are all likely to prove equally disagreeable for American interests. It has allowed the Kremlin to largely set the agenda for Russian-American engagement in the Syrian war, and it has consistently failed to set out a coherent strategy for how to deal with the violence in Syria. The United States may ultimately succeed in defeating the Islamic State. What will follow, however, will likely be just as inimical to America's long-term interests in the region. This is not how a great power is supposed to behave or conduct its foreign policy. That lesson will not be lost on either America's friends or its ever growing list of enemies in the Middle East."

""A View From the Bridge"" and ""The Crucible"" opened on Broadway. A staging of ""Incident at Vichy"" took place Off-Broadway. The New Yiddish Rep staged a Yiddish version of his most famous work, ""Death of a Salesman"" (with English subtitles). Miller's lesser-known play ""Broken Glass"" opened at the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut.Ivo van Hove's production of ""A View From the Bridge"" generated the most interest because of the unusual staging. It got rave reviews in London (winning the Olivier award) and had a similar reception last year in New York (winning the Tony award). That production recently opened at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles and I saw it on Thursday night. I've seen the play at least five times and it is my third favorite among Miller's plays, after ""The Price"" and ""All My Sons."" I wasn't crazy about some aspects of van Hove's version. The set was too spare and the performances were too stylized. Even so, I was impressed with all the actors, especially Frederick Weller as Eddie Carbone, with the exception of Thomas Jay Ryan's characterization of Alfieri, the lawyer who serves as the play's narrator and one-person Greek chorus, whose voice and posture lacked the moral gravitas that the role requires. Miller intended the character of 18-year old Catherine to be sexually innocent and naive, but the director's insistence that Catherine (played extremely well by Catherine Combs) constantly jump into her uncle Eddie's arms and wrap her legs around him strains credulity. I was also disturbed by the low-level music constantly humming during the play, and the occassional drum sounds, which all seemed designed to alert the audience to various turning points in the play and the overall theme of doom and tragedy. In other versions I've seen, the director trusts the actors and audience to get the point.The play centers on Eddie Carbone, a longshoreman who lives in Brooklyn's Red Hook working class and mostly Italian neighborhood in the 1950s with his wife Beatrice and his 18-year old niece, Catherine. From the start we see that Carbone has too much affection for the niece, who has lived with the Carbones since her parents died when she was very young. Beatrice is clearly jealous of Catherine, who has finished high school and is enrolled in a secretarial school. When she's offered a job as a secretary in a nearby business, Catherine encourages her to take the job and move out, but Eddie wants her to stay in school and stay in their home. The Carbones' lives are disrupted when two of their relatives from Italy -- brothers Marco and Rodolpho -- arrive in the U.S. as illegal immigrants. Back then, Italian Americans were expected to welcome their relatives into their homes, help them find jobs, and protect them from immigration authorities, and Eddie pledges to do so. But when a relationship begins between Rodolpho and Catherine, Eddie becomes jealous, but tries to mask his feelings by expressing concern that Rodolpho only wants to marry Catherine so he can become a U.S. citizen. Catherine is in love with the good-looking and easy-going Rodolpho and doesn't buy Eddie's accusations. So Eddie tries to persuade her that Rodolpho is homosexual, although he never uses that word. (He says that Rodolpho ""ain't right"" and other euphemisms). Eddie can barely contain his lust for Catherine. At one point, Eddie and Rodolpho get into a heated argument in front of her. But instead of punching Rodolpho, Eddie kisses him on the lips in order to expose and shame him for what he perceives as his rival's homosexuality. The situation spirals out of control after that and, as we're led to feel from the very beginning of the play, ends in tragedy.Indeed, most critics have viewed ""A View From the Bridge"" as a story of personal and family tragedy, as it certainly is. But there's much more to the play, including a political undercurrent that is easily missed if one isn't familiar with Miller's biography, including his personal and political experiences. Indeed, the play's back story is as fascinating as the play itself.It begins in 1947, when Miller was doing research for a screenplay in Red Hook,which is near the Brooklyn docks and where a lot of longshoremen and their families lived. That screenplay eventually became ""The Hook,"" which was based on a true story about the battle within the longshoreman's union. Miller finished the screenplay in 1950 and wanted his friend Elia Kazan to direct the film. Kazan had directed Miller's first two blockbuster Broadway plays, ""All My Sons"" in 1947 and ""Death of a Salesman"" in 1949. In 1951, Miller and Kazan traveled to Los Angeles to try to get a Hollywood studio to finance the film. Harry Cohn, the president of Columbia Pictures, expressed an interest in making the film but insisted that the ""enemy"" in the film be changed from corrupted union leaders to Communists, which he viewed as a greater threat to the dock workers. This was the McCarthy era. All the major Hollywood studios were trying to demonstrate how patriotic and anti-Communist they were. But Miller refused to change the script and the project died. A few years later, Budd Schulberg, a novelist and screenwriter, worked with Kazan on a screenplay for ""On the Waterfront,"" which made Marlon Brando famous and earned an Academy Award. ""On the Waterfront,"" is a total rip-off of ""The Hook."" What had changed between Miller writing ""The Hook"" and Kazan directing ""On the Waterfront"" is part of Cold War and Hollywood lore. Kazan and Schulberg, both former Depression-era Communists, had become ""friendly witnesses"" before HUAC, informing on (""naming names"") their former friends and fellow Communists, for which both (especially Kazan) earned decades of hatred among liberals, progressives, and radicals in Hollywood. Miller, in contrast, was also called before HUAC but refused to name names. ""On the Waterfront,"" which came out in 1954, was clearly meant to justify Kazan's decision to name names and became an informer. The hero of the film, Terry Malloy, played by Brando, informs on his his friends (including his brother), who are corrupt leaders of the longshoreman's union. The film portrays Malloy as a brave and heroic figure, who (with the support of his girlfriend and a local priest) testifies before a government committee against the corrupt union bosses, who were clearly meant as a stand-in for corrupt Communists.   Meanwhile, Miller was writing his own play about the Red Hook neighborhood that he'd first visited in 1947. He wrote it in 10 days in 1955 as a one-act play (which was staged in New York that year), and the following year expanded it to a full-length play (which opened in London in 1956 before coming to New York City). He based it on a story he'd heard in 1947 that reminded him of the plot of a Greek tragedy. An Italian-American longshoreman had turned in to authorities two illegal immigrants, relatives he had been sheltering in his home, in order to stop one of them from marrying his niece. He was banished and later killed. In that neighborhood, there was a clear code of honor: one doesn't inform on illegal immigrants - most of whom were family members of the Italian Americans. If you inform on your fellow Italians, you will be disgraced and, some cases, killed for violating the code. That was the origin of ""View From the Bridge,"" which debuted on Broadway in 1955, a year after ""On the Waterfront"" opened in movie theaters. Although ""View from the Bridge"" has no explicit political references, when it opened in September 1955 many critics recognized Eddie Carbone as a stand-in for ""informants,"" ""rats"" and ""stool pigeons"" -- people who betrayed their friends during the Red Scare witchhunt. Carbone, however, is not a one-dimensional figure. He's not simply a ""rat."" He's also a tragic character, which means that despite Miller's antipathy toward Kazan (they were never friends again) and other informers, he had some empathy for the situation they were in. Toward the end of ""A View From the Bridge,"" Eddie tries to do the right thing by telling his niece to get the two immigrant brothers out of the house right away. He realized that he'd done the wrong thing by calling the immigration agents (to force Rudolpho to leave the country). He wanted Catherine to get them out of the house before the immigration agents arrived, but he couldn't tell her why, which would expose the fact that he'd called the immigration agents. By that point in the play, Katherine no longer trusted Eddie, so she didn't do as he asked. The result is that the immigration agent came to the house and told the older brother, Marco, that he'd be deported back to Italy. Ironically, Rodolpho could stay in the U.S. because he was going to marry Catherine. Schulberg and Kazan took different sides than Miller in the metaphorical battle during the McCarthy era. Miller's ""View from the Bridge"" portrays informing as evil, while Schulberg and Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"" portrays informing as virtuous.  Obviously ""A View from the Bridge"" isn't simply a metaphor about McCarthyism and informing. A few years earlier, Miller had an affair with Marilyn Monroe, which ruined his marriage. ""A View from the Bridge"" reflects Miller's recognition that sexual passion can become a self-destructive obsession. (He later married and then divorced Monroe). One can also view Eddie's feelings for Catherine as a version of incest. Eddie's antipathy toward Rodolpho is clearly due his jealousy due to his own passion for his niece, who is thus off-limits to him. But the argument he made to his wife Beatrice, and to Katherine, was that Rodolpho was homosexual. However, we also learn that Eddie had stopped having sex with his wife, about which she complains to him and which she suspects is due to his passion for Catherine. But it could also be possible that he stopped having sex with Beatrice was because he was a latent homosexual. When he kissed Rodolpho, we're supposed to think it was to shame him and to show the others that Rodolpho was gay. But he could simply have make that accession to his face, in front of others, to send that message. He didn't have to kiss him. So Miller might have been suggesting that he was not only angry at Rodolpho for ""stealing"" Catherine away from him, but also angry at himself for his suppressed homosexual feelings. That Eddie and Beatrice, both church-going Italian Catholics in the 1950s, have no children also suggests that their lack of sexual intimacy may have as much to do with his sexual orientation (or perhaps impotence -- sexual as well as social and political) as his lust for his niece.  Sidney Lumet directed a French-Italian film version of ""A View From The Bridge,"" which was released in 1962. It starred Raf Vallone as Eddie, Maureen Stapleton as Beatrice, and Carol Lawrence as Catherine. It didn't do well at the box office but it made a bit of film history. It was the first film screened in America that showed a kiss between men. In 2005, Barry Levinson announced that he would direct another film version of the play with Anthony LaPaglia as Eddie, Scarlett Johansson as Shannon, and Frances McDormand as Beatrice, but it was never made. So, whatever happened to ""The Hook,"" the screenplay that Miller wrote in 1950 but which was never made into a film? It was finally produced last year, not as a film but as a play, by a British theater company. The British production got a lot of attention, not only in England but also in the U.S., although it has not yet been staged in the U.S. Miller died in 2005, so the British producer and director got an American playwright to revise Miller's screenplay into a play. The review of ""The Hook"" in the New York Times provided some of the play's history, but didn't mention that ""On the Waterfront"" was a rip-off of ""The Hook"" years ago. Another review, in a British publication, said that the two were ""similarly plotted."" The reviewer can't quite bring himself to say the Kazan and Schulberg stole Miller's idea. Until the days they died, Schulberg and Kazan claimed that they wrote ""On the Waterfront"" independently from Miller's original version of ""The Hook,"" but that is obviously a lie. Some articles about the ""On the Waterfront"" take Schulberg and Kazan's side in this dispute, while others see the clear line between the two stories. What's remarkable is that Miller never publicly rebuked Kazan or Schulberg for the heist.   Both Kazan and Schulberg were already major figures, but ""On the Waterfront"" solidified their reputations. Prior to ""On the Waterfront,"" Kazan had won plaudits as both a Broadway director (""All My Sons,"" ""Death of a Salesman"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" among them) and a Hollywood director for such films as ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" (1947) about antisemitism, ""Pinky"" (1949) about racism, ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951), which gave Brando's his first big break in film, and ""Viva Zapata"" (1952). After ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), he directed ""East of Eden"" (1955), ""A Face in the Crowd"" (1957), ""Wild River"" (1960), ""Splendor in the Grass"" (1961), the autobiographical ""America America"" (1963), and ""The Arrangement "" (1969). During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director, won three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes.Schulberg was already well-known for two highly-acclaimed novels - ""What Makes Sammy Run?"" (1941) and ""The Harder They Fall"" (1947) -- before he joined forces with Kazan with ""On the Waterfront."" ""What Makes Sammy Run?"" about upward mobility among working class Jews, was turned into several TV dramas as well as a successful Broadway play and later a musical. ""The Harder They Fall"" was turned into a wonderful 1956 film noir about the moral bankruptcy of boxing, starring Humphrey Bogart, based on the life of heavyweight boxer Primo Carnera. Schulberg won the 1954 Academy Award for his ""On the Waterfront"" screenplay, while the film also captured the Oscars for Best Picture, best Director ( Kazan), Best Actor (Brando), Best Supporting Actress (Eva Marie Saint), and several others. Schulberg also wrote the screenplay for the 1957 film ""A Face in the Crowd,"" which is one of the greatest unsung films of all time, anticipating the political power of television. It Andy Griffith in a remarkable dramatic role as a country singer, radio, and TV star who uses his celebrity to influence the political views of his followers and whose support candidates for political office seek. Many people this year have rediscovered the film because the Griffith character is a lot like Donald Trump.Like Eddie Carbone, Kazan and Schulberg faced opprobrium from Hollywood liberals and progressives for naming names They may have suffered emotionally from the widespread hatred, but it didn't harm their careers. Nor did the fact that their best-known collaboration was based on an idea that they pilfered from Arthur Miller have any negative consequences on their fame and fortune. But perhaps if Kazan and Schulberg hadn't stolen ""The Hook"" from Miller, the great playwright would not have felt compelled to write another waterfront story, ""A View From the Bridge.""

This year, at the 14th edition of the world renowned fragrance fair, Etienne de Swardt made me fall in lust with perfume.Olfactory curator, former NY Times perfume critic, author and eighth art activist Burr was kind enough last year, when I attended my first Pitti Fragranze, to clarify that scent is a work of art. What I came away with was a quote that I now refer to every time I need to clear my head about perfume, smell and scent. Think of it as the written word equivalent of that little beaker of coffee beans one often finds at perfumeries around the world. Scent is something different from smell. Smell can invoke memories, like when you step into the Paris metro or off a plane in Bombay, but scent is an art form. And we lack the terminology to speak of it that way, we lack the right words but it doesn't mean it shouldn't be treated as such. So when I discovered a talk between Burr and self-proclaimed ""troublemaker and perfumer"" Etienne de Swardt, founder of Etat Libre d'Orange at Pitti Fragranze, I knew I had to listen in. I craved to listen to these two powerhouses of perfumes. Born in South Africa, sporting a lovely French accent and a rocking sense of humor, de Swardt talked about perfume with passion, simplicity and charisma. He described in particular a few of the scents included in his brand -- the name of which refers to a South African free state in the late 19th Century, a Boer utopia of sorts with its own currency and laws that came to an end in 1902. What attracted me to Etat Libre d'Orange is this idea of perfume, personal scent, as a story we tell to each person we meet, through our skin. Everything becomes much clearer this way, and suddenly the reason we love someone immediately, or despise someone else at that initial meeting, depends deeply from a subconscious decision our olfactory sense makes. It's very cinematic to me, this idea of falling in scent at first sight. Very rockstar too... And that makes sense in my world. During the fascinating talk, the perfumer described 'Jasmin et Cigarette' a combination of two familiar scents which he called, ""very Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich."" It was fascinating to hear from de Swardt the source of inspiration for the scent, which ranged from ""the film we discussed while making this was Blade Runner, the smoking scene,"" and the song ""Thanks for the Memory, by The Platters,"" which he admitted was also ""the code name for the scent.""Burr jumped in to give his own, colorful translation of the scent into words, by saying ""it could be a photograph, something that is done by a Cindy Sherman... It would be a woman, a young woman, a French woman or a New Yorker."" Burr also added, ""it's intentionally somewhat cheap jasmine, she sprays herself with this perfume and she has a date, so she goes down and sits at a cafe and she smokes."" 'Jasmin et Cigarette', he concluded, is ""a portrait of this woman, an image that is astonishingly clear and astonishingly realistic -- the cinematic story.""I can always get behind a cinematic story, and when it comes to perfume, it's a match made in heaven. Equally elusive to describe and yet so powerfully sensual. With the next fragrance presented, it was time for roses. 'Eau de Protection' is a fragrance inspired and created with the help of Rossy de Palma, the quirky Spanish actress best known for her work with Pedro Almodóvar in beauties like Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.While de Swardt described 'Eau de Protection' as ""dangerous and quite charming, possessing all the facets of the rose, and sweet chocolate,"" Burr found the hidden meaning of the fragrance. ""I smell desperation and violence and terrible suffering, there is nothing feminine about it,"" Burr said. He also added that there is a hint of metallic blood in the scent, and concluded that the fragrance itself ""is in a sense perverse because it takes violence and presents it to you as something beautiful.""With the next scent, 'Fat Electrician' came a backstory as outrageous as the title of a perfume which Burr called, ""easily, the most beautiful work of perfumery done in my life."" 'Fat Electrician' is vetiver scented and inspired by the lead of '70s arthouse film Pink Narcissus, gay porn star Bobby Kendall. One day, filmmaker James Bidgood said about Kendall ""oh, he now is a fat electrician in New Jersey,"" and the name stuck. Burr admitted he wears it all the time, because of its use of the main note, ""vetiver, one of the most beautiful materials around and this is the best description of vetivers around."" Instead, de Swardt provided the cinematic analogy for the scent, by saying that 'Fat Electrician' ""is a tragedy, we call it the curse of beauty, that's the definition of that perfume.""There is also a perfume, co-created with actress Tilda Swinton, called 'Like This' and inspired by Rumi's famous love poem by the same name. A mix of Moroccan Neroli, with roses, ginger, pumpkin and spices thrown in, it's the perfect interpretation of a poem by the one poet of the Middle East who could actually help us solve all our world problems -- if only we united in reading him. When describing his brand de Swardt said, ""we are a beautiful blend of confusion, we generate emotion; we are on the skin, we spray on, so we are superficial but we are fundamental."" Fundamental. It was perhaps that word by de Swardt -- along with this cinematic view I felt while listening to him talk with Burr -- which made me run to the Etat Libre d'Orange stand immediately afterward and spray on some 'Jasmin et Cigarette'. The fragrance smelled as perfectly wonderful as I expected it to, with a twist of course, and I now yearn to have a full bottle.

Thanks to guys like Larry Olmsted exposing the problems in labeling, and Michael Pollan addressing what should be recognized as food - we are starting to really think about what we eat. My arena has always been seafood, what we are doing to and for our oceans. We've had an over-fishing problem for a long time, and to combat that, we've seen the rise of farm-raised fish and aquaculture. It's a great idea, but it's brought its own set of issues.  Aquaculture may be fairly new, but what many consumers don't realize is that the practice has brought its own set of dangers. Many farming processes, specifically salmon, include the same types of antibiotics and overdosing problems we've been warned about with commercially raised cattle. Crowded pens, sea lice infestations, toxic chemicals used to eradicate weed and algae growth - all symptoms of irresponsible farming practices, all present in modern day aquaculture.   ©May WildmanWhile the message may be bleak, it's not all bad news. Similar to commercial cattle operations, I'm now seeing responsible, passionate, and thoughtful aquaculture operations come into their own. These types of operators, including Canada's True North Salmon, have taken a different approach, using environmentally friendly practices and vertical integration to provide our county's favorite fish in a better way. These companies have looked past profits, and are raising fish in their native environments, embracing their natural habits and using antibiotics when needed, not as a blanket or preventative solution.  Driving this positive change? I give the credit to consumers: you've asked the right questions; you care about where your food is coming from. I'm proud to be a part of a huge movement to protect our oceans, and every time a restaurant customer checks Monterrey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch app or site before ordering, we further that cause and that protection.  I've given my career to this cause, and to see change on a consumer level keeps me going. I encourage each and every consumer to continue until we have more responsible solutions than irresponsible ones. Keep asking questions when you dine out and at the grocery store, know which choices are responsible and which ones contribute to environmental damage - and frankly aren't good for your body.  The ball is rolling, but we can't stop now - thank you for helping me make a difference, and I won't stop if you don't.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post in partnership with Secretary of State John Kerry's Our Oceanconference and Ocean Unite, an initiative to unite and activate powerful voices for ocean-conservation action.

Entitled ""In Challenge Lies Opportunity: How the world must respond to refugees and mass migration"", it sets out four key principles that we believe must be at the heart of a coherent international response: better coordinated response mechanisms to large flows of people; enhanced assistance to major refugee-hosting countries; increased resettlement opportunities and additional pathways for refugees; and respect for human rights and protection.The heads of state meeting in New York this week have a responsibility to prove that they take these matters seriously, and reject the politics of prejudice and populism that are proving all too resonant on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond.As Kofi Annan, Chair of The Elders, said on his recent visit to Germany to discuss these issues with top government officials, the solution to increased numbers of refugees can never be walls, fences or militarised borders.Prosperous countries of the world must show genuine compassion and shoulder their fair share of the burden of hosting refugees. How can it be fair that a tiny country like Lebanon, with a population of only 4 million people, hosts at least 1.5 million refugees, when some much wealthier European countries quibble about even receiving a few thousand?But equally, states in the developing world need to assume their own responsibilities. Leaders need to be held to account for the dire social, economic and human rights situations that cause so many of their citizens to flee abroad, believing there is no prospect of peace or security in their homeland. Addressing the root causes of flight is the key, not treating the symptoms.Pakistan, my home country, has been host to over three million refugees from Afghanistan ever since the Soviet invasion nearly 40 years ago. Most of these poor people have been languishing in squalid urban camps for decades - as, I should add, have millions of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Gaza and of course Syria, where they now find themselves victims of yet another war.This week in New York, leaders at the United Nations - in particular, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council who have the heaviest responsibility - must demonstrate their willingness to prioritise saving lives over political rivalries, whether in Syria, Ukraine or other conflicts too often seen through the prism of realpolitik than that of protecting civilians.Only a concerted international approach guided by the principles of solidarity, human rights and respect can deliver a durable solution Failure to rise to the challenge will only exacerbate the plethora of refugee crises the world faces today which in turn will further worsen global stability.The founder of The Elders, Nelson Mandela, saw this all too clearly when discussing refugee problems in Africa in 1997. His words still resonate today and will continue to inform The Elders' engagement on refugees and migration in the months and years ahead:""Unresolved refugee problems become a source of instability, violence and further population displacements. Dealing with these problems is inextricably linked to achieving peace, upholding the rule of law and entrenching a human rights culture and democracy.""Hina Jilani is a member of The Elders, the independent group of former leaders founded by Nelson Mandela who work for peace and human rights. This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post to mark the occasion of two critical conferences at the UN on the Refugee and Migrant crisis: the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants (Sept. 19th, a UN conference) and the Leaders Summit on Refugees (Sept. 20th, hosted by U.S. Pres. Barack Obama, at the UN). To see all the posts in the series, visit here. To follow the conversation on Twitter, see #UN4RefugeesMigrants."

Johnson and Stein met two of the three criteria the commission sets for participation: Both are constitutionally eligible to serve as president and have achieved ballot access in enough states. But neither met the threshold of having 15 percent of support in national polls.Johnson averaged only 8.4 percent, and Stein came in at 3.2 percent, according to the commission. The exclusion from the debate delivers a heavy blow to two third-party presidential bids that had hoped to sell themselves as viable alternatives to Clinton and Trump, both of whom suffer from notoriously low favorability ratings.“I would say I am surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the first debate, but I’m not,” Johnson said in a statement Friday, adding, “Americans are tired of rigged systems, and the monopoly on debates created by the CPD is a prime and skillfully executed example.”Johnson was in the news recently after giving an MSNBC interview in which he appeared to have no idea what Aleppo was. (The city in Syria has become a center of that country’s civil war and its refugee crisis.)Meanwhile, Stein and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka, are facing charges after protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline last week. The Morton County sheriff’s office in North Dakota issued an arrest warrant for the two and charged them with criminal trespass and criminal mischief.The first of two presidential debates is set to take place Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, at 9 p.m. Eastern time."

Trump made the comments to The Washington Post in an article that came out just 20 minutes before Obama, the first black president, took the stage at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Gala, so Obama may not have seen them. But Clinton, who spoke next, clearly did. “He was asked one more time where was President Obama born, and he still wouldn’t say Hawaii. He still wouldn’t say America,” she said to the crowd of mostly Latinos. “This man wants to be our next president?” she asked. “When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry? Now, he’s tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is.” Clinton and Obama both spoke at the gala about the need to renounce Trump and his divisive rhetoric. Clinton pointed to not only Trump’s latest birther comments, but also his attacks on a pastor in Flint, Michigan, and numerous anti-Latino and anti-immigrant comments. The goal was to inspire Latinos, who support Clinton over Trump by large margins, to vote for both her and the down-ballot candidates who can help her enact her agenda, including the comprehensive immigration reform that she has promised.“We need to decide who we are,” Clinton said. “If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are? We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric. We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear.”Obama implored the crowd earlier in the evening to ensure that Trump’s brand of politics doesn’t win. “I know there are a lot of folks who have this notion of what the ‘real America’ looks like. Somehow it only includes a few of us,” Obama said. “But who’s going to decide who the real America is? Who’s to determine that in this nation of immigrants — in a nation where unless you are a Native American, you came here from someplace else — that you have a greater claim than anybody here?”He got an especially warm reception at an event where he was heckled over immigration just two years earlier. There were boos when he said it was his last time at the event as president, and someone interrupted him by yelling, “I love you,” earning them an “I love you, too” from the president. But the biggest applause was for Obama’s praise for immigrants.“It’s young people like that that keep me going,” Obama said. “Folks who prove that immigrants aren’t somehow changing the American character, immigrants are the American character.”The Trump campaign later released a statement saying the Republican nominee believes Obama was born in the United States, while still praising Trump’s past questions about the president’s citizenship.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
