Read Part One, ""A Rendez-Vous With History.""William Henry Hunt, president of Racing Club Stéphanois, bid adieu to his rugby players as they departed St. Étienne for the battlefields of northern France a century ago. He did not see most of them again as so many perished in the Great War's carnage. The esteemed president did, however, help their families and others through his leadership and position as U.S. Consul. As a result, Hunt's standing reached new heights during the war. His influence served to cement rugby's place amongst the Stéphanois. Hunt was the rare African American consul in Europe when war broke out in 1914. Since 1844, when William Leidesdorff was appointed Vice Consul at Yerba Buena (today's San Francisco), African Americans served at consular posts overseas. Strides towards expanding their opportunities and presence were made during the McKinley, Roosevelt, and Taft presidencies. Between 1880 and 1920, there were 50 African American consuls. The majority were assigned to posts in the Global South, particularly within the French Empire. Yet, a few served in France, such as Yale-trained doctor George H. Jackson (La Rochelle 1898-1908; Cognac 1908-1914), where attitudes about race were more welcoming than other parts of Europe and the United States.Hunt benefitted from this period of promotion. First appointed Vice Consul at Tamatave, Madagascar, in 1899, he succeeded his future father-in-law Mifflin Wistar Gibbs as U.S. Consul there in 1901. The island was remote, but Hunt developed a close personal relationship with Madagascar's then-governor, General Joseph Gallieni. This steadfast friendship deepened after Hunt was posted to France. Gallieni sent a warm welcoming post card shortly after the consul's January 1907 arrival at 5, Place de l'Hôtel de Ville in St. Étienne.The American quickly became a pillar of Stéphanois society. He gave speeches and lectures in fluent French, and joined several clubs. He easily blended in, perhaps aided by his appearance. While labelled ""colored"" in Department of State records of the era, Hunt was light enough to ""pass,"" a result of his white, black, and Native American ancestry. According to his biographer, Adele Logan Alexander, Hunt was an athletic man -- tall and good-looking -- who didn't outwardly fit into any one identifying category other than ""American."" William Henry Hunt, 1911 Credit: William H. Hunt, Official Personnel Folders-Department of State; Record Group 146: Records of the U.S. Civil Service Commission; National Archives, St. Louis, MOHunt led in other ways. He became involved in Racing Club Stéphanois shortly after his arrival. The consul was a self-styled sportsman and avid horseman rumored to have taught the Malagasy Queen how to ride. This was an era that idealized ""muscular Christianity,"" the Protestant belief that sports developed character and leadership traits as epitomized by Theodore Roosevelt. Hunt was thus very much a byproduct of the movement. Rugby held a privileged place in France at the time. It was esteemed by the elites as a true gentleman's game and regarded as ""modern"" thanks to its English roots. Moreover, the sport had a strong presence in the pre-war Loire region. Thus, it made sense that Hunt grew involved. When Racing fused with another local club, Stade Forézien, in 1915, Hunt was made president of the new team, which was eventually renamed Stade Forézien Universitaire (SFU). Hunt used his presidency to benefit the community throughout the war. On March 26, 1916, he presided over a journée sportive at the Hippodrome de Villars. The day's athletic competitions and entertainment raised much-needed funds for soldiers' families. The American helped in other ways. He visited relatives of the war's casualties and tried to ease their pain. The consul obtained information about loved ones missing in action behind enemy lines through the International Red Cross network. Accordingly, Hunt's influence and popularity amongst the Stéphanois skyrocketed. Such measures were conducted alongside his normal consular duties. Hunt helped evacuate U.S. citizens during the war's first weeks, issued emergency consular passports, and contended with left-behind luggage. He remained in frequent contact with the U.S. Embassy in Paris, and visited several times while Gallieni was charged with the capitol's September 1914 defense. As a representative of a neutral nation, Hunt acquired responsibility for German, Austro-Hungarian, and Turkish subjects. Thus, he visited and inspected internment and prisoner-of-war camps within the St. Etienne district. Hunt also facilitated trade between U.S. manufacturers and French consumers.After the war, the American consul used his high stature to help heal and mend the community through rugby. His standing and sponsorship drew more fans to SFU's matches, where the communal experience of cheering the team helped renew bonds. The local press noted that Hunt cemented the game into the city's social fabric through his sportsmanship, authority, kindness, and devotion.In the spring of 1927, as Hunt's departure for his onward assignment in Guadeloupe neared, SFU held a series of going-away celebrations. The long-serving president's farewell fête was held at Brasserie Januel on Saturday, April 23. Numerous toasts extolled Hunt's virtues and recalled how he helped St. Étienne during the war's darkest hours. Many diners noted the American's success in reinforcing rugby's stature, which as one local paper wrote, would be his lasting glory. A plaque to commemorate Stade Forézin's 32 war dead was laid at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in 1931. In some ways, perhaps it was also testament to the efforts and influence of one American consul during and after the war.To learn more, we invite you to read ""Views From the Embassy"" and visit U.S. Embassy Paris' World War One Centenary page."

We all have cabin fever and are dreaming of the beach. But here's a list of some ways to shake the cold. Before you know it, you'll find yourself complaining about the heat :) 1. Escape to an indoor water park for a day. The snow may be deep, but indoors, the water will make you forget that it's still winter. What kid doesn't love a trip to a hotel and when you bring a book and relax poolside, you'll be thinking its June. 2. Have an indoor picnic. Sometimes, my daughter enjoys when I throw a blanket down on the family room floor and we pretend we are at the beach. We bring in our lunch and play card games and watch summer-themed movies like Teenage Beach Movie, Soul Surfer or Dolphin Tale. We eat ice cream and she will even dress the part, putting on shorts or her swimsuit. 3. Get out of the house! Bundle up, venture out and break the cabin fever by trying a new place. Locally, we have a new Pacman-themed restaurant called 257 at Woodfield mall. I've seen many good reviews on it and what kid doesn't love a restaurant filled with video games and memorabilia? There's always a new hot spot in your neighborhood you've been meaning to try and it's a good way to beat the winter boredom. 4. Get smart. Sometimes when it's warm out and there is a lot to do, going to museums isn't an idea your kids jump for joy over. BUT when they've been trapped in the house during months of cold and they are stir-crazy, a museum is a fun local get away that will also get their minds moving. 5. Have an art party in the snow. I have filled squirt bottles with food coloring and let them go out and paint the snow. They love turning the mounds into rainbows and it's cheap and easy fun! 6. Bake yourself warm. Kids love to cook and there's no doubt you have pinned tons of recipes you still haven't tried! Let everyone pick one recipe and have a bake-off. My sister does a fun chopped family challenge that we have recreated at our house. Hey, this is a two-for-one -- it's fun plus you have to cook them dinner anyway, right?7. Have an '80s movie night. My daughter and I have this planned for this weekend. We are having a marathon of movies from my younger years like 16 candles, The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. It's all new to her and a trip down memory lane for me. Ahhhhh, Jake Ryan.8. Embrace the cold. Kids don't mind this weather half as much as we do. Bundle them up and hit the slopes. I've seen tons of great Groupons for winter sports. Teach them to ski or snowboard or just hit a local sledding hill. Rosy cheeks and giggling are a sure fire way to beat the blues."
2,POLITICS,Legal Experts Tell Congress Obama's New War Authorization Fails To Limit Power,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-aumf-congress_n_6764080.html,,2015-02-27,"U.S. President Barack Obama, arrives to deliver a statement on legislation he sent to Congress to authorize the use of military force (AUMF) against the Islamic State with John Kerry, U.S. secretary of state, background, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2015. Obama formally asked Congress to authorize military action against Islamic State, saying the extremist group has committed 'despicable acts of violence' and would threaten the U.S. if not confronted. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eafe1f00003d02257afa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- National security law experts, testifying before the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday, faulted President Barack Obama’s proposed authorization for the fight against the Islamic State, saying it adds more presidential authority for waging war. Obama offered the new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, as a conciliatory gesture to those who have criticized the administration's reliance on authorizations from 2001 and 2002 to fight an entirely different enemy. But rather than replacing the old authorizations, the new AUMF provides an additional legal tool for waging war. Robert Chesney, associate dean for academic affairs at the University of Texas School of Law, told the committee that concerns over the restrictiveness of the new authorization are misplaced as long as the 2001 AUMF remains active. “To summarize the matter bluntly, the administration’s draft fails -- and intentionally fails -- to address the relationship between this new authorization and the 2001 authorization,"" he said. ""The result is that its authorities are, optics notwithstanding, simply additive with respect to presidential authority.” Congress has split along unusual party lines on the AUMF debate. Democrats have criticized the authorization as overly broad for failing to specifically define the enemy or place geographic limitations on the fight against the Islamic State. Republicans say they see it as overly restrictive because it would expire after three years and would prohibit “enduring offensive ground operations.” The 2001 AUMF, passed by Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks, was intended to serve as the legal justification to fight the al Qaeda and Taliban threat in Afghanistan. The vagueness of its language has allowed two presidents to expand military operations into Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, and most recently, airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, without additional approval from Congress. Obama has long voiced his intention to repeal the 2001 AUMF and replace it with updated legislation. Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, testified that the new AUMF may offer “political constraints,” but emphasized that it “generates essentially no meaningful legal constraints” on the president’s ability to wage war. The political restraints Wittes mentioned were the three-year sunset clause and the limited use of U.S. ground troops. But even these are “intentionally fuzzy,” in their wording, as White House press secretary admitted two weeks ago. “The resolution does not define 'enduring,' which is a word ripe for elastic interpretation,” explained Wittes. “What’s more, as long as the president might reasonably characterize such operations as defensive, the restriction would not apply at all.”Top-level officials disagree about the definition of “enduring.” Secretary of State John Kerry told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, ""If you're going in for weeks and weeks of combat, that's enduring. If you're going in to assist somebody and fire control and you're embedded in an overnight deal, or you're in a rescue operation or whatever, that is not enduring.”The following day, retired Gen. John Allen, the presidential special envoy for the coalition fighting the Islamic State, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ""Enduring might only be two weeks. But enduring might be two years.” Similar ambiguity surrounds the definition of an “offensive” operation. Chesney pointed out that while the operation to retake Mosul from the Islamic State may appear obviously offensive, the administration could argue that it is, in fact, a defensive response to the Islamic State seizing the territory from the Iraqi government. To Chris Anders, senior legislative counsel at the ACLU, the new war authorization repeats several of the mistakes made in 2001. “I think the difference is that in 2001, members of Congress didn’t know that they would end up with those kinds of expanded interpretations by the executive branch,” he said. “At this point, given how the 2001 AUMF has been used over the past 13 years, all members of Congress should be going into this with their eyes wide open and realize that any place where there’s arguable ambiguity is going to be taken advantage of -- whether by this administration, or a future one.” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), an outspoken proponent of narrowing the president’s war authority, has called for an AUMF that repeals its 2001 and 2002 predecessors, confines the battle to Iraq and Syria, limits ground troops to training purposes, and requires Congress to revisit the authorization after 18 months. “We shouldn’t treat this as if it has to cover all contingencies,"" Schiff told The Huffington Post. ""It’s not like the president can never come back to Congress and ask for a new authorization. Unless the Congress wants to legislate itself into irrelevance in war-making power, we shouldn’t provide an open-ended war authority that may outlast all of us.”In his closing remarks, Chesney told the committee, “If I have one message for this committee, it is to think about this new authorization within the old one. Otherwise you end up talking about restrictions that really aren’t restrictions. You end up doing all kinds of things you don’t mean to be doing, or you don’t know you are doing.”  "

Now it's finally happened and it was awesome.Spoilers to follow for ""House of Cards"" Season 3, Episode 3.The third episode of the new season, ""Chapter 29"" -- which should more accurately be titled ""Frat Party"" as there's excessive shot taking and a game of beer pong between Claire and Catherine Durant -- was the beginning of Frank's dealings with Russia. In the episode, fictional Russian president Victor Petrov (Lars Mikkelsen) -- who is clearly modeled after Vladmir Putin -- pays a visit to the White House to talk business with President Underwood. There, during a state dinner, Petrov runs into Nadezhda ""Nadya"" Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, two of the members of feminist Russian punk rock band Pussy Riot. In real life, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were arrested in 2012 and imprisoned for almost two years by the Russian government for their protesting Putin's anti-gay regime. When Petrov gives the pair a rather mocking toast, the women stand up to share their own speech. Through their translator (Pyotr Verzilov, Tolokonnikova's husband) they say, ""To Victor Petrov, who's royalty runs so deep he's given his friends half of the country, who's so open to criticism that most of his critics are in prison, the commander-in-chief who is not afraid of anyone except gays."" (The last line but isn't translated in the episode, but Tolokonnikova described it to Russian opposition magazine New Times.) The three are quickly ushered out of the White House, but their mission was accomplished.In a recent interview with New Times, the band members said they didn't feel like Petrov totally captured the true essence of Putin. ""In the [show] Petrov is more of a little tsar,"" said Alyokhina. ""He is too jolly for Putin, of course."" Alyokhina said the character is more of a mix of Putin and former Russian president Boris Yeltsin.But the two do more than just make a speech. At the end of the episode Frank mentions the two Pussy Riot members during a press conference, calling them ""true Russian patriots who exhibit the very best their country has to offer."" Like them, Underwood declares that he stood up to Petrov in a effort to fight for peace (but we all know Frank could care less about peace and patriotism and just wants what's best for himself). The credits then roll over Pussy Riot performing a song they wrote for the series alongside Le Tigre. While ""House of Cards"" creator Beau Willimon wanted them to write a song against fictional Petrov, they decided to write ""Don't Cry Genocide,"" which they said is ""devoted to the militarization of society and to American drones in particular.""Season 3 of ""House of Cards"" Season 3 is available on Netflix."

Though she has a misdemeanor for attempted theft and a prior deportation, immigrant rights advocates are confident she would qualify for the deportation relief program announced last year by the Obama administration. The courts have blocked the implementation of that program, however, while a lawsuit against Obama's executive actions proceeds. When Castro went to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement this past Monday, as she has done regularly in the four years since her deportation case began, they told her she would have to wear an ankle monitor -- which advocates say could signal that authorities are thinking about removing her from the country. “It makes no sense that after four years of checking in they would put me in the ISAP program,” Castro said, referring to the Intensive Supervision and Appearance Program, an alternative to detention through which ankle monitors are administered. “For me, this is a humiliation.” Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for information about Castro’s case. Castro would appear to be the kind of person President Barack Obama had in mind when he said in November that his new policy would make it a priority to keep law-abiding families together. One part of that policy, a program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA, offers work authorization and deportation relief to undocumented parents of U.S. citizens who have lived in the country for five years and who pass a background check. Roughly 4.1 million people are believed to be eligible for DAPA.Castro, a 39-year-old mother of three, works cleaning homes in New Orleans, where she says she has lived since 2008. She says she moved there to join her husband, who went there shortly after Hurricane Katrina to work in construction. She has joined civic efforts to advocate for immigration reform, and appeared on MSNBC earlier this month to show her support for deportation relief. But with 26 states suing to overturn Obama’s executive actions on immigration, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction earlier this month to keep the Obama administration from implementing the executive actions announced in November. With DAPA blocked, people like Castro continue to face the risk of deportation, advocates say. “We know she’s not a priority and she would qualify for DAPA,” Fernando Lopez, an organizer with the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice, told The Huffington Post. “This is a pattern we’ve been seeing with our members -- even though these people qualify [for DAPA] and ICE should be reviewing these cases, it’s not something that is actually happening... They’re being asked to bring their plane tickets or another stay of removal.” Despite getting slapped with an ankle monitor, Castro says she’s confident DAPA will eventually triumph in the courts and she will win relief from deportation. “I qualify for DAPA,” Castro said. “I’m not afraid.” "

It passed the House 420-0 earlier this month. The only thing left is for President Barack Obama to sign it into law.""This bill, I believe, is a fitting honor that recognizes the courage and determination of the civil rights marchers at Selma 50 years ago,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) declared on the Senate floor. ""It was a very historic day, and it marked an alteration in the history of America. It changed an unacceptable abuse of American rights: the right to vote.""But the disconnect between the masses of lawmakers honoring the marchers and those trying to restore the Voting Rights Act is stunning. The Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the law in 2013. That section determined which states and localities that had a history of minority voter suppression had to get permission from the Justice Department to change their voting laws. In a 5-4 ruling, the court left it up to Congress to update that section with a new formula for designating which regions of the country need special scrutiny. Nothing has happened since, because Republicans won't support legislation to fix the law. A House bill introduced in the last Congress had just a handful of GOP co-sponsors. The Senate version had none.The prospects for action in this Congress look even worse. Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) and John Conyers (D-Mich.) reintroduced the House bill, with fewer GOP co-sponsors than before. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is expected to reintroduce the Senate bill soon, but he doesn't have a single Republican co-sponsor.In the meantime, states that previously required pre-clearance from the federal government -- Mississippi and Texas, to name two -- have been able to pass laws that make voting more difficult for people who are poor, disabled or a minority, through such means as requiring a government-issued photo ID in order to vote.With the approach of March 7, the 50th anniversary of the start of the Selma marches, it's worth noting amid the ceremonies which lawmakers are -- and aren't -- actually doing something to try to strengthen voting rights.Below is a handy list of the lawmakers who have signed onto this year's House bill and last year's Senate bill to restore the Voting Rights Act. Lawmakers don't have to co-sponsor the bill in order to support it, but The Huffington Post hasn't found any additional GOP supporters of these bills.Neither of Alabama's senators, Republicans Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby, responded when asked if they plan to sign onto Leahy's bill.House bill -- The Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015"

8,HEALTHY LIVING,A Monthlong Celebration of Our Yearlong Devotion,"Nancy Brown, ContributorCEO, American Heart Association",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-monthlong-celebration-f_b_6761712.html,"Throughout February, in communities across the country, millions of supporters have been coming together, wearing red, and reinforcing the critical message that we can overcome heart disease and stroke.",2015-02-27,2015-02-26-0130FeatureAmericanHeartMonthV2_Blog.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-26-0130FeatureAmericanHeartMonthV2_Blog-thumb.jpg,"As we come to the close of American Heart Month 2015, I'm reminded of how much every second counts.Throughout February, in communities across the country, millions of supporters have been coming together, wearing red, and reinforcing the critical message that we can overcome heart disease and stroke. They've shared this message with an energy and passion that make it clear that time is of the essence.Although American Heart Month comes to a close Saturday night, I know the fight will continue in our race against the No. 1 and No. 5 causes of death in our nation.Just like a birthday or anniversary is really just a reminder to tap the brakes on our busy lives and pay extra attention to someone or something that matters to us each and every day, American Heart Month offers the same opportunity. It's our time to stop and thanks the legions of people who've taken it upon themselves to improve cardiovascular health.There are so many to thank: researchers who are striving to develop new treatments. Physicians and nurses who provide the highest level of care. Survivors who inspire us with their courage and give hope to others by sharing their personal story. Loved ones who play crucial roles as home caregivers. And the countless volunteers and advocates who are helping to raise awareness and educate others about prevention, risk factors and warning signs. We give thanks to all of them because they will continue to make a difference, regardless of the month or season.In February 2004, we launched our Go Red For Women movement to build awareness that heart disease is not just a ""man's disease,"" but in fact kills more women than men each year in the U.S. and claims more women's lives than all forms of cancer combined. For this reason, over the past 11 years, American Heart Month also has been a time to focus on how far we've come and the challenges that remain in addressing women's leading health threat.Since Go Red For Women was launched, more than 1.9 million have gotten involved, and we're pleased that nine out of 10 go on to make meaningful, healthy lifestyle changes after joining, such as adopting a regular exercise routine or making healthy adjustments to their diets. Go Red For Women is a true community that encourages women to have open conversations about their experiences, their concerns and their goals for improving their cardiovascular health.We officially celebrate the anniversary of Go Red For Women on the first Friday of each February, National Wear Red Day, and more and more people have been taking part each year. Among this year's highlights were more than 400 news anchors and TV personalities wearing red; more than 550 buildings and landmarks illuminated in red, including Niagara Falls, Graceland and Pikes Place Market; and countless events held in homes and workplaces.Something else that struck me during this month was the depth of our discussions about women's heart health. The more we discuss the issues, the more provocative our conversations become. Another telling detail was the diversity of our audiences. Beyond traditional measures like age and ethnicity, there was a wider breadth of how people came to us -- such as organizations and companies that are either new to our team, or who have become more committed. For instance, one luncheon I hosted featured leaders from three organizations that are newly involved. It was so moving to hear those women describe why they've become involved.Most events feature personal stories told by survivors, sometimes more than one. I'm always awed by the bravery of women who have suffered from the disease or lost someone close to them. Their willingness to show us their pain in hopes of lessening the suffering of others is the purest form of charity.The Woman's Day Red Dress Awards was a perfect example, with powerful speeches from actress-model Andie MacDowell and several other women. Andie spoke about her mother's death at age 53, explaining what it's like to endure such a loss and the disappointment of not being able to share her successful career with her mom. This 12th annual event was a beautiful night recognizing icons who are helping further the cause of women's heart health, such as FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg and CVS Health.Red dresses were popular this month -- especially on the runway at the Red Dress Collection Fashion Show, an event that's kicked off Fashion Week in New York annually since 2003. Go Red For Women and the National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute's (NHLBI) awareness campaign, The Heart Truth, both use a red dress as an iconic symbol. We took the lead on this shortly before last year's event, and were excited to have a full year to plan this year's event along with Macy's and NHLBI. Rosie O'Donnell opened the event and Fifth Harmony closed it, with more than 20 celebrity models strutting the latest styles in between. This gathering of celebrities and fashion was enjoyed by everyone who was there or who watched online.While those two events are in their second decade, two more prominent celebrations have been going strong since the middle of the last century. Pioneering events such as these types, and the loyal volunteers behind them, have turned us into the organization we are today.On Valentine's Day 1956, several months after President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack, folks in Florida showed their appreciation for his lifesaving care by holding their first Palm Beach Heart Ball. We celebrated the 60th anniversary of this event on Feb. 13. This milestone occasion for our longest-standing Heart Ball was a wonderful tribute to the event's heritage, anchored by its legendary chairwomen.In Washington, D.C., we enjoyed an even longer-running event, the 67th Affair of the Heart Luncheon and Fashion Show, which is focused on raising money to research the mysteries of heart disease. I was honored to recognize seven researchers whose studies were funded by this group... and I enjoyed the fashion show, which showed off wide-leg pants for women and floral patterns for spring.As great as these events are, their primary objective is helping us continue funding lifesaving research into cardiovascular diseases and stroke. We've invested more than $3.7 billion, including more than $100 million annually since 1996, totals topped only by the federal government. The answers are out there, and we're determined to find them. So it's only fitting that we held three key scientific conferences this month.Our International Stroke Conference was the largest ever, bringing together more than 5,000 people from around the world. Observers described the presentations as the best they've seen in 20 years, offering hope for breakthroughs in stroke prevention and treatment. We are honored that these presentations were made at our event. We also hosted the International Consensus on CPR and ECC Science Conference (ILCOR), which is held every five years, and the Kawasaki Disease Symposium, which is held every three years. At ILCOR, leaders of resuscitation research came together to work toward the next guidelines for how CPR is to be administered; results will be published in October. The Kawasaki event brought together people around the world for the latest science developments in this rare disease, and how to reduce patient suffering. What made these two events so memorable was the presence of their pioneers: Guy Knickerbocker, one of the founders of CPR as a lifesaving technique, and Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki, the namesake of the rare disease. This put quite an exclamation point on the theme building our promising future atop the shoulders of our proud past. These are just some of the incredible events that are so important because of the awareness they generate. Whether people attend or just read about them, the more we can engage, the better we can fight heart disease. Our reason for doing this is simple. As you may have seen in our new tagline, Life is Why."

The summit is hosting a group of potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates to discuss core conservative principles ahead of the January 2016 Iowa Caucuses. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ea94260000360083c0f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) used her speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday to focus on veterans' issues, a sharp departure from the more relentless Obama bashing she has delivered at CPACs past.Palin spoke about the numerous challenges that many veterans face once they return home from war, including post-traumatic stress disorder, unemployment, divorce and suicide. ""As we gather here, we're safe, we're secure, we're having fun, four days together at a conference. In those four days, 92 of our veterans will have taken their lives,"" she told her audience in National Harbor, Maryland.The former vice presidential candidate also said that veterans weren't receiving the care that they needed from the Veterans Affairs Department and alluded to the scandal over long waiting times for appointments at VA hospitals.""America hands over her sons and her daughters with the promise that they're going to be taken care of,"" Palin said. ""We can't wait for D.C. to fix their bureaucratic blunders. This bureaucracy is killing our vets. They wait for months, they wait for years to get treatment at the VA, and they're losing hope.""""Just because one guy at the top resigned, well, the problems didn't resign,"" Palin said, referring to former Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, who resigned last spring after reports about waiting times and falsified records emerged.Palin didn't just criticize; she offered her own policy suggestions for improving veterans' lives. She suggested, for instance, that Congress should pass legislation to secure veterans' benefits permanently. She also said that the government should provide vouchers to veterans to pay for health care outside the VA system.Her latest remarks were certainly clearer than a confusing speech she gave last month at the Iowa Freedom Summit, which was criticized by conservatives and cheekily applauded by Democrats. The focus of her Tuesday speech was also a contrast to her previous two CPAC speeches in which she focused more on lobbing zingers at President Barack Obama.Still, Palin offered a few one-liners on Thursday. She criticized Obama's foreign policy, called for a more muscular approach to fighting the Islamic State and took issue with recent comments by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf that the United States could not beat those militants simply by killing them.""Oh, the naive Obama State Department. They say we can't kill our way out of war. Really? Tell that to the Nazis. Oh wait, you can't. They're dead. We killed 'em,"" Palin said."
10,HEALTHY LIVING,Surprising Racial Disparities Found In Flu Vaccine Rates,Anna Almendrala,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flu-vaccination-racial-disparity_n_6756204.html,,2015-02-27,"FILE-This Thursday, Jan. 10, 2013 file photo shows vials of flu vaccine in Philadelphia. As the flu season winds down, health officials say it wasn't as bad as last year and the vaccine worked better. But younger adults were hit harder because of a surge of swine flu. Overall, hospitalization rates for the flu are only about half what they were last winter. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e94ee3c000032000a9ae4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This year's flu strain was particularly brutal, disproportionately affecting children and the elderly. A record-breaking rate of 217 of every 100,000 people over the age of 65 have been hospitalized for the flu, while 80 children so far have died from the disease, reports AP. And while flu season is officially in retreat as of Feb. 14, researchers are hoping to take lessons from this year that can be applied to the 2015-2016 season. A small survey presented on Feb. 23 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology in Houston illustrated one area of concern: racial disparities in flu vaccine rates. The survey, conducted in the suburbs around Detroit, found that black people are less likely to get vaccinated for the flu than either white or Asian people. The survey data shed light on an opportunity to improve the communication around vaccines -- especially when it comes to dispelling myths about the injections in some communities, according to lead researcher Dr. Melissa Skupin of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.“There’s a lot of misinformation out there about vaccines in general, but particularly the flu vaccine,” said Skupin in a phone interview with The Huffington Post. “People don’t think it works, and when they don’t think it works, they’re less likely to get it.”Skupin sent anonymous surveys to six outpatient clinics in the suburbs of Detroit in 2013. The survey asked patients whether they had received a flu vaccine the previous year. It also asked them about demographic information and their perceptions of the flu vaccine. She received 472 responses and found that 93 percent of people who identified as white had gotten a flu vaccine, 84 percent who identified as Asian got one, but only 62 percent of people who identified as black got one.However, Skupin did find that a doctor’s recommendation could significantly influence a person’s decision to get vaccinated; 90 percent of people got the shot if their doctor recommended it, but only 58 percent of people did so if their doctors didn’t recommend it. Unsurprisingly, Skupin's survey also revealed that people who believed the flu vaccine would help them were more likely to get one (90 percent), as opposed to the people who got a flu vaccine despite not believing in their benefit (58 percent).Skupin didn’t break down the different reasons people gave for not getting the flu vaccine by race, so she can’t say for sure why the racial disparity in vaccine rates exists in suburban Detroit. But doctor recommendations depend on trust and communication, and previous research has shown it can be notoriously lacking between medical professionals and some communities of color. As a result, people of color sometimes suffer the most when it comes to vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, as the 1989-1991 resurgence in the U.S. showed; Black, Native American and Latino children were three to sixteen times at greater risk for contracting measles than white children during that epidemic, according to a 2014 CDC report. Skupin's survey wasn't nationally representative, but she hopes that her data inspire doctors to be more pro-active about recommending vaccines, as opposed to simply offering them to patients. “A lot of doctors do recommend the flu shot, but for some reason the message is not getting through to patients -- that we want them to get it, and that we think it’s beneficial to them,” said Skupin.“Some of it may have to do with the approach -- saying, ‘Would you like the flu shot today?' as opposed to 'I recommend you get the flu shot, and here’s why,'"" she suggested. ""Maybe physicians should be a little bit more proactive and interactive with their patients on vaccines.""The flu affects an estimated five to 20 percent of all Americans and puts more than 200,000 in the hospital every year, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The flu caused 3,697 deaths in 2013. Health authorities recommend the flu vaccine to anyone over six months old. However, only about 45 percent of adults get vaccinated for the flu every year, according to CDC numbers from the 2011-2012 flu season. There is a silver lining, however. While there are disparities among different races, vaccine rates for all race groups have inched upward since 1989.Skupin hopes that trend continues, as more people bring questions about vaccines to their doctors. ""We want people to ask questions and bring in any concerns they have about vaccines, rather than just not getting vaccinated.” "

The son of a New York City real estate tycoon, Durst is accused of murder for killing a neighbor at a low-rent Galveston apartment house where they both lived, then dismembering the victim and throwing the body parts into Galveston Bay. (AP Photo/Pat Sullivan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4a717210000e700c81579.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An heir to his family's billion-dollar New York real-estate fortune, Robert Durst almost witnessed his mother's suicide as a child, emerged as the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance years later, became estranged from his family after his brother secured the chief position in their business, was accused of dismembering his neighbor's body, began cross-dressing to disguise himself and urinated on a cash register at a Texas CVS. Enticed? You should be watching ""The Jinx."" HBO's miniseries, currently halfway through its six-episode run, is more gripping than whatever else you're watching on television right now. The genre-bending show is catnip for anyone who spent the final months of 2014 obsessing over the podcast ""Serial."" Replace Adnan Syed with 71-year-old Durst, and give host Sarah Koenig's role to Andrew Jarecki, the filmmaker at the helm. Jarecki directed 2010's ""All Good Things,"" a fictionalized take in which Ryan Gosling portrays a Durst analog. An elusive presence for years while the New York media gobbled up his scandal like a midnight snack, Durst, for reasons not quite clear, volunteered to discuss his case with Jarecki. Out of that, ""The Jinx"" was born.Bringing true-crime reenactments to prestige TV, ""The Jinx"" employs newspaper headlines, diary excerpts, investigative footage and interviews with Durst's affiliates (including family members, attorneys, friends of his wife and others) to piece together a mystery that has no probable solution. The framing device of ""Serial"" stemmed from Syed's skepticism over Koenig's interest in his 15-year-old case; ""The Jinx"" contains the opposite DNA, yet, because Durst was never convicted of murder, packs even more allure. It's ""Serial"" for the rich and privileged. Durst's willingness to discuss the case gives him a certain ownership, but the whodunnit makes him a performer, as though he's cast himself in his life story. The labyrinthine tentacles -- divorce proceedings that immediately predate his wife's disappearance, a mobster's daughter who becomes a player, mysterious collect calls, questionable investigations -- rely on Durst's alibis, which are often airtight enough that he almost comes off as a victim. You will be flabbergasted by the narrative's developments, compounded by the visual medium they inhabit. Sure, this could be a podcast or book, but then you wouldn't get to witness Durst's dry cadence and uncanny tics. ""The Jinx"" is a new achievement for HBO, whose longstanding highbrow crown has not yielded much in the way of unique programming formats. Here is a presentation seemingly fit for Investigation Discovery earning the glamour of the network's sleek production values. The Errol Morris parallels don't shy from frothy gossip, but it has a polish that suits both the eccentric plutocrat at its center and the lofty platform that houses it (along with an opening-credit sequence that feels like a blatant ""True Detective"" ripoff). Tune in now. Besides, what else are you going to watch?""The Jinx"" airs Sunday at 8:00 p.m. ET on HBO."

The former oil executive with experience in conflict resolution has been chosen to lead a global Anglican Communion riven by sharply divided views on gay people and their place in the church. Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron announced Friday that Justin Welby, 56, a fast-rising priest with only a year's experience as a bishop, had been picked to succeed Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual leader of the world's 77 million Anglicans. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fbcb210000d601c91e1f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ever wanted to kick it with the Archbishop of Canterbury? Here’s your chance. Justin Welby, the senior bishop of the worldwide Anglican Communion and a self-described “spiritual magpie,” is looking for a few good young men and women (aged 20 - 35) to live with him in London’s Lambeth Palace. The one-year residency comes with a pretty choice digs -- Lambeth Palace has been the residence of the Archbishops of Canterbury since the 13th century. The 16 young people will be living in cottages on the leafy grounds of the palace, which is located right on the River Thames in central London. Forty commuters from the London area are also invited to participate in evening and weekend programs. But the invitation comes with a challenge. The residents will be asked to step away from the “busyness of contemporary life” and establish a “daily rhythm of silence, study and prayer.” They’ll also be required to commit to volunteering with their local community.The Archbishop is calling his social experiment The Community of St. Anselm. It invites people to a new sort of monastic life, one that mixes the ancient with the post-modern and upends the traditional view of monks and nuns closeted away from the world. Welby wants his newly forming crew to be very much involved in life outside Lambeth Palace.And since the residency ends after a year, there's no expectation that these young people will go on to join a religious order.Swedish Anglican priest Rev. Anders Litzell has been chosen as the community’s prior. He says the program is not meant to be a getaway for rest and relaxation. ""There will be sacrifices required. People will need to leave things behind,"" Litzell told HuffPost. Litzell says the church is drawing on ancient traditions, such as those set by St. Benedict, St. Francis, and St. Ignatius, with an eye toward balancing monastic life with actively serving in the world. ""This is a question of how we can model a life of prayer and deep commitment shaped in the likeness of Christ for people who aren't going to be monks and nuns, but who want to embody the monastic traditions, who want to draw from those deep wells and live a lifestyle influenced by that spirituality,"" Litzell said.Applications will be accepted on the Community of St. Anselm website starting on Friday, February 27, and candidates will have to go through a formal interview process. The residency will begin in September. "

Gov. Pat Quinn announced Monday, Jan. 13, 2014, that emergency rules for the storage and handling of petroleum coke are being filed this week with the Illinois Secretary of State. ""Petcoke"" is a byproduct of oil refining that's been accumulating along shipping channels and has sparked health and environmental concerns. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb165002200003501db4c6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s not easy to take on a wealthy, multi-national corporation and win. Especially for residents of Chicago’s struggling southeast side.But that’s exactly what's happening on the banks of the Calumet River, where the steel plants that used to give residents of a mostly Hispanic neighborhood access to a middle-class lifestyle were replaced, nearly two years ago, with black dust called petroleum coke (“petcoke”) piled five or six stories tall. The piles of petcoke -- a byproduct of the oil refining process -- belong to KCBX Terminals, owned by the conservative billionaire Koch Brothers. The piles have been roiling area residents ever since the black dust of mostly carbon and sulfur began blowing into the backyards, playgrounds and neighborhood parks. It blackens skies and leaves behind a sticky residue, raising concerns about aggravated asthma and other health issues. This Aug. 30, 2013 cell phone image provided by Anthony Martinez, shows a dust cloud rising from piles of petroleum coke during a storm near residences on the southeast side of Chicago. (AP Photo/Courtesy of Anthony Martinez)A small but energetic coalition of residents have stepped up to fight the blight, holding protests and marches, educating their neighbors about the issue and pressuring elected officials. They've made incredible progress in a relatively short time.Last week, as the Chicago Tribune reported, BP, one of KCBX’s largest customers, abruptly announced it would discontinue sending its petcoke to the site beginning this summer. In addition, the city of Chicago announced it had denied KCBX’s request for a deadline extension to enclose its petcoke piles via multi-million dollar structure. Shortly thereafter, KCBX announced it would “consolidate” its two petcoke storage and handling sites into one, removing the piles but continuing to operate as a site where petcoke would be transferred between trains and barges.The third petcoke site in the area, owned by Beemsterboer, shuttered its facility and removed all of its petcoke last year.Still, area residents believe their battle against some of the most influential players in one of the nation’s most powerful industries, is very much ongoing -- and they are digging in for more. In this Oct. 25, 2013 photo, a large mound of petroleum coke, or petcoke, is seen in the background near a residential neighborhood on Chicago's southeast side. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)Tom Shepherd, president of the Southeast Environmental Task Force, one of the organizations on the front lines of the petcoke battle in Chicago, said his group is “waiting for the next shoe to drop.” “It remains to be seen whether it will be a foolproof operation over there [at the consolidated south terminal],” Shepherd said. “We’re in a wait-and-see pattern right now.”Shepherd and others have been have been working to get petcoke out of the neighborhood ever since the piles started to appear in the summer of 2013.It is Shepherd who spearheaded a bus tour for individuals interested in getting a closer look at the petcoke facilities and the communities surrounding them. His organization, as well as the Southeast Side Coalition to Ban Petcoke and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), have also led demonstrations calling for petcoke to be banned from their community. In addition, they’ve gone door to door in the neighborhood, talking to the community about the facilities and collecting information about how the petcoke has impacted residents' day-to-day lives.The groups’ efforts have also attracted the attention of political leaders, including U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, former Gov. Pat Quinn and Mayor Rahm Emanuel — all of whom have made appearances in the neighborhood to address the issue. Legislation has also followed at the federal, state and city level. However, only the city’s efforts — Emanuel reportedly told KCBX to “clean up or shut down” — have gained traction to date.Petcoke also became the leading campaign issue in the ward's aldermanic election Tuesday. Alderman John Pope, the neighborhood’s City Council representative and an Emanuel loyalist, faced criticism from a crowded field of challengers that he was too slow to address the issue. (Pope will be heading to a runoff election against Susan Sadlowski Garza on April 7.) In a non-binding referendum, 85 percent of voters in the ward voted to support banning petcoke from the district altogether.But Olga Bautista, an activist with the Southeast Side Coalition to Ban Petcoke, believes there is good reason for the neighborhood to remain skeptical despite the recent progress.Of particular concern is the possibility that transferring petcoke at the KCBX site will simply pose a different environmental issue. A group of area residents and activists poses with the weather balloon rig they are using to monitor petcoke operations in their neighborhood.She says she and other activists will continue to collect data on the sites using a balloon mapping technique they learned through a partnership with Public Lab, an organization that works to democratize environmental monitoring and assessments. Using a 5-foot weather balloon with a camera attached to it, as well as an open-source software program called MapKnitter, they can document what is happening at the sites and ensure the company is obeying regulations concerning the height of the petcoke piles (nothing higher than 30 feet is now allowed).Bautista's group is also working to develop curriculum to teach students at schools in the area how petcoke connects to larger climate change issues.She remains focused on getting the city to give KCBX the boot, despite company officials saying last week they ""remain committed to Chicago"" and plan to work within the city's regulations.“We don’t know of any community who’s been able to successfully kick out the Koch brothers and that’s what we’re calling for,” Bautista said. “We’re not going to back down from our original demand to ban the stuff. It’s going to be us, moms and dads like me, who hold them accountable. We’re not going to stand by and watch these companies make millions and billions of dollars and at the same time they make us sick.” An aerial image of the petcoke piles attained using the balloon mapping technique.Another lingering question is where BP will send its petcoke now that it's no longer shipping it to Chicago. “A final decision has not yet been made on where this material will be stored in the future,” BP spokesman Scott Dean told HuffPost in a statement.That answer is not a comfort to activists, like Josh Mogerman, who fear the dangerous material could be heading just across the border to Indiana.“Just shifting this blight to another community or down the river is good for folks on the southeast side, but not a win,” Mogerman, spokesman for the NRDC, said. “They produce a lot of this stuff, and it has to go somewhere.”"

Second, thank you for breathing new life to a volatile political issue at an event that has become as safe as glitter. It was wonderful to see you reading from a note instead of reciting from memory, so that no message would be lost for the short amount of time you were allowed to deliver an acceptance speech. After all, your message was urgent and you had the whole world for an audience, millions all over the world, many of whom were gays and people of color. Like me and my friend, both gay, both men of color, both immigrants, you know, the ones you claimed to have ""fought for:""""It's our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the United States of America.""It's time for all the women in America -- and all the men that love women and all the gay people and all the people of color that we've all fought for to fight for us now.I understood your intentions. I grew up in a household full of women. You were speaking for my mother, my sister, my aunts, my niece, and all the other women around me. They taught me early on about feminism, without having to sit me down and push for a political agendum with a placard or a t-shirt, but instead, by letting me be witness to their struggle for crumbs that fall their way. I saw gender inequality growing up in Manila, watching my mother juggle several low paying jobs to raise a family. I saw gender inequality working in New York, as many women around me hit the glass ceiling of organizations I worked for. I owe my life, my way of thinking, my activism, my political perspective to all the women who raised and taught me. I learned to understand the core of equal rights and equal pay. I understand the need to remind people that such inequality still exists. There is nothing I want more than the women of my life, especially those who have had children and are aging, to have the same opportunities as their male counterparts.   But I also know and understand, in my years of living in America, that equal rights for men and women don't necessarily translate to equal rights for gay people and people of color. In this fight for justice, there are many bandwagons of issues, all of them connected while the human rights music plays until they break apart like years of rusty chains once certain rights are achieved for some people. The question becomes, whose bandwagons are left, and who is going to fight for the rest? This is when your statement -- ""and all the gay people and all the people of color that we've all fought for to fight for us now"" becomes the rust the breaks the chains. The fight for human rights for all shouldn't be mutually exclusive. You don't have to call on us separately to fight for gender equality. We are not in the corner of the room waiting to be brought into the fight. We sit front row, us -- gay people and people of color -- because gender inequality is our problem too, perhaps more of our problem as it can't be separated from the weight of racism and homophobia. Many of us, like my friend and I, sit in multiple bandwagons where all the other ISMs splinter most. It is difficult to prioritize one issue over the other, even if it seems, for instance, for the undocumented, that the fight for immigration legalization precedes all other fight for equal rights.Honestly, I waited for someone to make a political statement at Oscars night. I am grateful for your courage, despite the possible backlash of making one's political agenda public. We live in such an imperfect world run by a few white men. Thus, it's hard not to see white privilege while watching the Oscars, its movies about white lives, and the awards that go to whiteness. It's hard not to interpret your statement as a white feminist remark. It's hard not see Sean Penn's ""greencard"" joke as offensively racist. The institution that gave you the award is in itself the fire breathing dragon that needs slaying, if not tamed soon enough. At the very least, you can make a movie next year about white women and gender inequality and have the Oscars rally around you. It is never the same for gay people and people of color, as evidenced by the lack of color in this year's Oscar movies. The bandwagon in which you sit are miles away from the rest of us. Perhaps this is where the real conversation about social justice begins, how we can all sit in the same bandwagon so we can travel together to fight for our many causes. There will be no need to insinuate indebtedness, or who goes first, next, or last. We can't help you break the chain of oppression, if the rest of us will be left behind. Not now, not anymore.

The point of travel is often to escape our fellow humans and get in touch with ourselves, not to schmooze and booze with a mashup of noisy others we've only just met. Enter the Sacred Introvert Retreat, where quiet folk can travel, well, quietly. But with other people. The 10-day tour takes place in and around Glastonbury, England, a small market town known for its proximity to ancient and mystical sites. Introverts will stay in a 36-acre abbey estate with orchards, ponds and a bee colony. They'll take guided tours of Stonehenge, a neolithic tomb, ancient Roman baths and trees said to inspire Tolkien's tales.But all this, of course, will be done with an introvert's needs in mind. During tours, there will be ""no rushing from place to place and no tour guide barking over your thoughts,"" the tour's site promises. For every day spent adventuring, travelers will have a quiet ""local day,"" where they can cruise around their estate in silence or venture to nearby healing springs, churches and inns. There will be yoga and meditation sessions, a bonfire, a pub night and a workshop on the merits of being an introvert. The whole point is to foster a sense of ""quality intimacy"" with self, others and nature by avoiding the bustle that comes with other group trips. Sounds like a true vacation."
19,POLITICS,Wisconsin Lawmakers Pass Right-To-Work Bill As Thousands Protest,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wisconsin-right-to-work-bill_n_6752750.html,,2015-02-26,"WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 30: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker speaks at the American Action Forum January 30, 2015 in Washington, DC. Earlier in the week Walker announced the formation of 'Our American Revival', a new committee designed to explore the option of a presidential bid in 2016. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ea6e24000032005778a1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MADISON, Wis. -- Spelling more trouble for organized labor in the U.S., Republican legislators in the Wisconsin state Senate approved a right-to-work bill here on Wednesday, sending the measure to a GOP-controlled Assembly where it's also expected to pass. Republican leaders chose to fast-track the bill in what's known as an extraordinary legislative session, allowing for less debate than usual.Debate over the bill drew an estimated 2,000 protesters to the state Capitol on both Tuesday and Wednesday, reminiscent of the passionate labor demonstrations surrounding Act 10 in 2011, though vastly smaller in scope. As with that earlier legislation, which stripped most collective bargaining rights from public-sector employees, vocal opposition from the state's unions wasn't enough to stop the right-to-work bill in its tracks.Legislators are expected to take up the measure early next week in the state Assembly, where Republicans enjoy a comfortable majority. The office of Gov. Scott Walker (R) has already said he will sign the bill if it reaches his desk.The fight in Madison is just the latest indication of how state Republican leaders, often controlling both the statehouse and the governor's mansion in their respective states, are managing to enact laws that weaken the clout of organized labor. If the Wisconsin measure is approved, the Badger State will become the 25th right-to-work state in the country, following two other Midwestern states, Michigan and Indiana, that passed such laws in 2012. ""It is a symbolic tipping point, or an inflection point,"" Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, said of potentially half the states in the country being right-to-work. ""For the longest time there were 22 right-to-work states. Now the right-to-work people have the momentum.""Under U.S. labor law, a union that wins an election in a workplace must represent all the workers in the bargaining unit, even the ones who may have voted against the union. Unions, therefore, prefer contracts in which all the workers have to support the union financially. Right-to-work laws make such arrangements illegal.Under right-to-work, no employee can be required to pay fees to the union. Once provided with an out, many workers inevitably stop paying, leading to what unions derisively call ""free-riding."" With less money in the coffers, unions can't bargain as well or recruit new members as effectively.The fallout from Michigan's passage of right-to-work is already visible. Last year, the estimated number of union members dropped by 48,000, despite the fact that the state added 44,000 more workers to its economy, according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the halls of the Wisconsin Capitol, union members voiced their own fears about what the legislation could mean for their wages, their benefits and their unions' long-term viability.""We're going to have free-riders and free-loaders,"" said Steve Buffalo, district manager for International Union of Operating Engineers Local 139, which represents heavy-equipment operators. ""But these guys are so strong that I think we'll stay intact. We've been here a hundred years and we plan on being around for another hundred.""Conor Kuzdas, an apprentice with the operating engineers, said he worries what a loss of funding could mean for the training and safety of workers who come up behind him. ""I know everyone is worried about wages and pensions, but that's a big thing for me,"" Kuzdas explained. ""There's just a lot of dangerous stuff that we do ... We want to make sure that the people around us are trained.""On Tuesday, members of the Senate's labor committee listened to a stream of testimony from experts, business owners, business lobbies and unions about their predictions if Wisconsin became right-to-work. Backers of the legislation promised more business would come to the state, while detractors assured it would result in lower wages with no additional jobs. In the end, all that testimony did little to sway the expected outcome, as Republicans cut the session short and moved the bill out of committee, while many union members were still waiting to testify. As expected, the bill then survived hours of debate Wednesday in the full Senate, with Republicans beating back a host of amendments put forth by Democrats, including one that would have raised the state's minimum wage. The final vote split mostly along party lines.One Republican, Sen. Jerry Petrowski, said he was not voting for the measure because he wasn't convinced of the purported benefits advanced by backers of the bill.""I’m a Ronald Reagan Republican, and like President Reagan I was a union member for many years,"" Petrowski said in a statement. ""Under the law as it stands, unions are formed by a majority vote and everyone gets to choose where they work."" Petrowski, however, was alone among Republicans.Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, said Republicans fast-tracked the bill to avoid discussion. ""They do that for a reason,” Neuenfeldt said. ""The reason they do fast-track is they don’t want to have a public debate. They don’t want people to understand what they’re doing.""The bill's fast-tracking presents another problem for unions. If the law is quickly enacted, unions won't have much time to extend their current contracts before the state becomes right-to-work. (Many unions in Michigan managed to do just that, likely delaying a loss of dues-paying members for a matter years.) Democrats proposed an amendment that would have put off the bill's enactment for three months, but Republicans voted it down. Just as discussion of the bill by lawmakers began Wednesday, union members and other protesters filled the balconies in the Capitol, shouting “shame” at the closed doors of the Senate floor, which was cordoned off by police.Randy Bryce, a former Democratic state Senate candidate and member of the Ironworkers Local 8 union, was removed from the gallery for disrupting the proceedings just as Scott Fitzgerald, the Senate’s GOP leader, began reading the bill. Bryce told The Huffington Post afterward that he spoke out because he never had a chance to testify the previous day, even though he was listed on the schedule.“I told them they’re turning Wisconsin into a banana republic,” Bryce said. “The way they’re passing this bill is wrong -- it’s not democratic.”Bryce said he and many of his union colleagues had given up a day’s pay from their construction jobs to join the protests on Tuesday and Wednesday. Ultimately, they never got a chance to put their comments into the record. ""I don’t think what I did is nearly as disruptive as what [lawmakers] are doing in there,” Bryce said.Much of the language in the right-to-work legislation was drawn from similar bills in other states. Business lobbies, in general, tend to push right-to-work bills, since they have a way of weakening unions in already-unionized workplaces. By extension, the bills also hurt the Democratic Party, since unions tend to back Democratic candidates.Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, a state trade group, is one of the leading proponents of the measure in Madison. Wisconsin still has above-average union density when compared with other states, with 11.7 percent of wage and salary earners belonging to a labor union. The national average is 11.1 percent, and just 6.6 percent in the private sector.But overall, union membership in Wisconsin has dropped sharply since Act 10 rendered most public-sector unions unable to bargain; the state's overall rate of union membership fell by more than half a point last year alone, likely driven by more public-sector workers dropping out of their unions. If passed, a right-to-work bill would similarly depress membership in the private sector.""Membership always dwindles after right-to-work legislation passes,"" said Secunda. ""And at the end of the day, this is going to go through."""

The farm, the largest potato from in Greenland, has seen an extended crop growing season due to climate change.

'Were used to change, said Greenlander Pilu Neilsen. 'We learn to adapt to whatever comes. If all the glaciers melt, well just get more land. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1647d260000cf00818ae5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"No, climate change is not experiencing a hiatus. No, there is not currently a ""pause"" in global warming.Despite widespread such claims in contrarian circles, human-caused warming of the globe proceeds unabated. Indeed, as reported here at The Huffington Post just last month, the most recent year (2014) was likely the warmest year on record.It is true that Earth's surface warmed a bit less than models predicted it to over the past decade-and-a-half or so. This doesn't mean that the models are flawed. Instead, it points to a discrepancy that likely arose from a combination of three main factors (see the discussion my piece last year in Scientific American). These factors include the likely underestimation of the actual warming that has occurred, due to gaps in the observational data. Secondly, scientists have failed to include in model simulations some natural factors (low-level but persistent volcanic eruptions and a small dip in solar output) that had a slight cooling influence on Earth's climate. Finally, there is the possibility that internal, natural oscillations in temperature may have masked some surface warming in recent decades, much as an outbreak of Arctic air can mask the seasonal warming of spring during a late season cold snap. One could call it a global warming ""speed bump."" In fact, I have.Some have argued that these oscillations contributed substantially to the warming of the globe in recent decades. In an article my colleagues Byron Steinman, Sonya Miller and I have in the latest issue of Science magazine, we show that internal climate variability instead partially offset global warming. We focused on the Northern Hemisphere and the role played by two climate oscillations known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or ""AMO"" (a term I coined back in 2000, as recounted in my book The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars) and the so-called Pacific Decadal Oscillation or ""PDO"" (we a use a slightly different term--Pacific Multidecadal Oscillation or ""PMO"" to refer to the longer-term features of this apparent oscillation). The oscillation in Northern Hemisphere average temperatures (which we term the Northern Hemisphere Multidecadal Oscillation or ""NMO"") is found to result from a combination of the AMO and PMO. In numerous previous studies, these oscillations have been linked to everything from global warming, to drought in the Sahel region of Africa, to increased Atlantic hurricane activity. In our article, we show that the methods used in most if not all of these previous studies have been flawed. They fail to give the correct answer when applied to a situation (a climate model simulation) where the true answer is known. We propose and test an alternative method for identifying these oscillations, which makes use of the climate simulations used in the most recent IPCC report (the so-called ""CMIP5"" simulations). These simulations are used to estimate the component of temperature changes due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and other human impacts plus the effects of volcanic eruptions and observed changes in solar output. When all those influences are removed, the only thing remaining should be internal oscillations. We show that our method gives the correct answer when tested with climate model simulations. Estimated history of the ""AMO"" (blue), the ""PMO (green) and the ""NMO"" (black). Uncertainties are indicated by shading. Note how the AMO (blue) has reached a shallow peak recently, while the PMO is plummeting quite dramatically. The latter accounts for the precipitous recent drop in the NMO.Applying our method to the actual climate observations (see figure above) we find that the NMO is currently trending downward. In other words, the internal oscillatory component is currently offsetting some of the Northern Hemisphere warming that we would otherwise be experiencing. This finding expands upon our previous work coming to a similar conclusion, but in the current study we better pinpoint the source of the downturn. The much-vaunted AMO appears to have made relatively little contribution to large-scale temperature changes over the past couple decades. Its amplitude has been small, and it is currently relatively flat, approaching the crest of a very shallow upward peak. That contrasts with the PMO, which is trending sharply downward. It is that decline in the PMO (which is tied to the predominance of cold La Niña-like conditions in the tropical Pacific over the past decade) that appears responsible for the declining NMO, i.e. the slowdown in warming or ""faux pause"" as some have termed it.Our conclusion that natural cooling in the Pacific is a principal contributor to the recent slowdown in large-scale warming is consistent with some other recent studies, including a study I commented on previously showing that stronger-than-normal winds in the tropical Pacific during the past decade have lead to increased upwelling of cold deep water in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Other work by Kevin Trenberth and John Fasullo of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) shows that the there has been increased sub-surface heat burial in the Pacific ocean over this time frame, while yet another study by James Risbey and colleagues demonstrates that model simulations that most closely follow the observed sequence of El Niño and La Niña events over the past decade tend to reproduce the warming slowdown.It is possible that the downturn in the PMO itself reflects a ""dynamical response"" of the climate to global warming. Indeed, I have suggested this possibility before. But the state-of-the-art climate model simulations analyzed in our current study suggest that this phenomenon is a manifestation of purely random, internal oscillations in the climate system.This finding has potential ramifications for the climate changes we will see in the decades ahead. As we note in the last line of our article, Given the pattern of past historical variation, this trend will likely reverse with internal variability, instead adding to anthropogenic warming in the coming decades. That is perhaps the most worrying implication of our study, for it implies that the ""false pause"" may simply have been a cause for false complacency, when it comes to averting dangerous climate change.This commentary is a cross-post with RealClimate.__________Michael Mann is Distinguished Professor of Meteorology at Pennsylvania State University and author of  The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines (now available in paperback with a guest foreword by Bill Nye ""The Science Guy"")"
