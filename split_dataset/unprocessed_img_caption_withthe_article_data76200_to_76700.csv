3,POLITICS,Craft Beer Stars In New White House Trade Deal Push,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trade-deal-craft-beer_us_5616d1bce4b0dbb8000db936,"Cool tariff reductions, bro.",2015-10-08,"Kevin Selvy, CEO of Crazy Mountain Brewing Company, told reporters on Wednesday that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would boost his company's exports.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5616d49a1400002a00c79827.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you like American craft beer, you will like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, according to the White House.The White House is pushing back on claims that the trade deal it just negotiated with 11 Pacific nations will cost the U.S. manufacturing jobs, promoting the accord as a massive tax cut for businesses that will boost U.S. exports and generate more high-paying jobs. And they want you to know that this is especially true for the hip, resurgent American craft beer industry.Kevin Selvy, CEO of Crazy Mountain Brewing Company in Colorado, joined an Obama administration press call on Wednesday to talk up the trade agreement’s benefits for the beer industry. The call was held to promote an Obama administration study published Thursday that claims the TPP will cut 18,000 tariffs on American goods and services.Selvy, who is featured in the report, said foreign demand for Crazy Mountain beer is rising, noting that the company began exporting beer in 2013 and foreign sales now account for 20 percent of its revenue. “Pretty early on we realized the demand for American beer abroad was reaching a fever pitch,” he said. “It is going through what French wine went through in the '70s, where folks all over the world decided it was the best” and began drinking it en masse.But Selvy said high tariffs on beer in TPP nations like Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Australia doomed the company's attempts to sell to those potentially lucrative markets.U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman told reporters on the call that tariffs on beer can reach 47 percent in some TPP nations, and that the deal will eliminate them.Selvy said he anticipates hiring several people within the first few months of the trade deal taking effect.The decision to feature the brewing company appears to be part of a strategy to highlight how the deal benefits young, stylish companies -- rather than, for example, the mammoth drug companies critics of the deal fear have the most to gain.On Wednesday, the White House sent out an email featuring a letter from Sam Franklin, the founder of Greenvelope, a Seattle-based company that makes “elegant electronic invitations.” The message's subject line -- “This is a pretty cool trade deal. Here’s why:” -- made its goal of appealing to young people comically explicit, and its body explained why the TPP will help Franklin's business. But the Obama administration’s insistence that TPP benefits exporters will do little to assuage many economists and activists who believe it will still harm larger and more consequential manufacturing exports like automobiles.“If you talk about a few million dollars in craft beer or cherries” -- another White House favorite -- “it pales in comparison in terms of auto jobs and parts, which are extremely vulnerable” under the terms of TPP, said Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing research for the progressive Economic Policy Institute.In addition to concerns about American job losses, TPP opponents argue the deal will weaken corporate regulations, increase prescription drug prices, endanger the environment and limit Internet freedom. The Obama administration announced on Monday that it had completed negotiations over TPP with the leaders of 11 Pacific nations. The deal still faces a steep climb before it becomes law, however, since it will need the support of congressional Republicans to pass and they have been voicing skepticism of the latest version of the agreement.Braden Goyette contributed reporting."
4,POLITICS,"Progressive Activists Protest For A Cause You Should Hear More About, But Won't",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/activists-protest-philadelphia-fed_us_56159463e4b0cf9984d84fc9,You say monetary policy isn't your thing. Maybe it should be.,2015-10-08,"Members of the Philadelphia community group ACTION United protest outside the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Tuesday, October 6.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5615984f1600002d0003857c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than a dozen community activists picketed the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia this week, protesting what they say is the bank president’s refusal to meet with them to discuss how Fed monetary policy affects real people. The roughly 15 activists are members of ACTION United, an organization representing low-income people of color in Philadelphia. ACTION United is affiliated with the national Fed Up campaign, a coalition of progressive groups advocating Fed monetary policies that prioritize full employment and shared economic prosperity.Fed Up and ACTION United planned Tuesday's protest because they say that Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker reneged on a promise to meet, and allow group members to give him a tour of low-income neighborhoods where they are active. The activists point to a video in which Harker appears to commit to the meeting in a conversation with ACTION United organizer Kendra Brooks at the annual Jackson Hole symposium in August. When Brooks followed up, Theresa Singleton, the Philadelphia Fed’s vice president and community affairs officer, said in an email obtained by HuffPost that a meeting was not in the cards, because the bank is reluctant to work with “just one organization."" Instead, Singleton invited Brooks to Tuesday’s community development briefing for low- and moderate-income community stakeholders. Singleton also said Fed staff would “design and organize” their own community tour.That response rankled Fed Up and ACTION United members. The Federal Reserve has a dozen regional banks, and the activists have met or have planned meetings with all of the regional Fed leaders except Philadelphia's since the campaign began in August 2014. They want a meeting -- and they want it to take place in an economically distressed community of color -- not in the Fed’s offices.So they decided to pressure the Philadelphia Fed with a protest, featuring Fed Up’s trademark “What recovery?” signs and green ""Whose Recovery?"" T-shirts.ACTION United also sent Brooks to the community development briefing, where she and several nonprofit executives and bankers who work with low- and moderate-income earners spoke with Harker and Singleton.Brooks said she was mostly pleased with what she heard from Harker and other Fed officials, who she said sounded genuinely committed to researching the conditions in communities the Fed serves and finding ways to improve “economic autonomy” in the Philadelphia region. “The outcome of the meeting was much better than we anticipated, but going in, we did not know the information that we knew coming out.” Brooks said. “We hope he will continue to keep the doors open for organizations like ours and our coalition. And that we will continue to be a part of that conversation and not excluded.”But Brooks noted that the Fed officials did not discuss how monetary policy and the Fed’s adjustment of interest rates disproportionately affects low-income workers and communities of color.For the Fed Up campaign, the exclusion of monetary policy reaffirms that nothing short of a meeting between Harker and activists will suffice.“We appreciate and accept the invitation to discuss community development and research, but this is not a substitute for the promise President Harker made to Fed Up,” said Shawn Sebastian, a policy advocate and staff attorney for the Fed Up campaign. “President Harker promised to speak with working families in the black neighborhoods of Philadelphia about their experiences -- where unemployment is double white unemployment. Harker promised to discuss how his monetary policy decisions can build a true full employment economy that works for everyone.”Philadelphia Fed spokeswoman Marilyn Wimp, in an email to HuffPost, didn't address a question about whether Harker reneged on his promise to meet with protesters. She instead pointed to Tuesday's briefing as evidence of Harker's interest in reaching out to diverse parts of the community. But the list of the Tuesday briefing’s attendees reveals that Brooks was the only stakeholder from a group with a position on Fed interest rates.Crafting monetary policy is a main responsibility of the Federal Reserve regional banks. Regional Fed presidents occupy five of the 12 seats on the Federal Open Market Committee, responsible for adjusting the Fed’s benchmark interest rates. Lately, they have accounted for half of the committee’s votes, because the Senate has failed to approve presidential nominees for two of the seven seats reserved for members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington.The FOMC keeps its benchmark interest rates low when it is more concerned about full employment, and raises them to curb excessive inflation when the economy has grown enough to drive up prices.Fed Up wants the central bank to maintain current low interest rates for the near term, which will allow economic demand to continue to grow, benefitting workers with more jobs and higher wages. The campaign applauded the Fed’s decision to leave rates unchanged in September.But Fed Up leaders said they're worried about the Philadelphia Fed and the role its president may play in future monetary policy decisions. The Philadelphia region's previous Fed president, Charles Plosser, who left the post in March, was an outspoken inflation hawk.Harker, who will serve a one-year term on the FOMC in 2017, was a member of the Philadelphia Fed board’s search committee for a new president, recusing himself once he became a candidate.Harker’s views on monetary policy are not yet known. He is a former trustee of the Goldman Sachs Trust, which Sebastian and other Fed Up critics said they worry will make him more sympathetic to financial institutions' concerns about inflation."

With poor quarterback play and a consistently undisciplined team, the team's ownership and front office hired Todd Bowles, another defensive guru and a first-time head coach.A football team's record just one month into the season isn't exactly the definitive measure of its success, but at 3-1, with a stunning Week 2 Monday night road win over quarterback Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts, Bowles appears to have the Jets in prime position to finally challenge the New England Patriots in the AFC East.In fact, it's the best start Gang Green has had since 2010 -- which just so happens to be the last time they took a trip to the conference title game.Perhaps part of Bowles' charm is his straight arrow, no-nonsense approach. In other words, he's the antithesis of Ryan. ""We understand that we've only played one quarter of the season, and all we did was get off to a good start,"" Bowles said on Monday. ""We haven't accomplished anything.""Oh, but they have.After a strange start to training camp -- where a teammate broke starting quarterback Geno Smith's jaw -- the Jets were once again the talk of the league, and for all the wrong reasons.

To be sure, this is not a quick-strike, explosive offense, nor is Fitzpatrick headed toward the Pro Bowl. What the Jets offense has become, however, is a steady blend of long, sustainable drives and a dominant running attack. Despite missing one game, running back Chris Ivory ranks third in the NFL in rushing, with a healthy 5-yard average behind a productive offensive line.All of that melds perfectly with a fantastic defense that continually forces three-and-outs and turnovers. The return of cornerbacks Antonio Cromartie and Darrelle Revis in the secondary has also allowed Bowles to do what perhaps nobody in this league does better: create highly confusing and productive blitz and coverage packages that even the most dominant quarterbacks tend to struggle with.In the win over Indy, Luck endured one of the worst games of his career, totaling a measly 21 of 37 through the air to go along with three interceptions and a lost fumble. Through four games, the Jets boast the second-best total defense in pro football -- and maybe just as impressively, they have already matched last season's forced turnovers total with 13. It's one key reason why they've also outscored opponents by 40 points, the sixth-best clip in the league.""I think we're growing together,"" Bowles added after the win in London over Miami. ""I think everybody is starting to realize that we can become a good team, but we’ve got to cut out a lot of mistakes ahead and we have a long haul to go. It’s not going to happen overnight. But the guys are getting a lot more confident.""Confidence never seemed to be lacking during Ryan's regime, but that didn't yield results in his last four seasons with the Jets. For a 51-year-old rookie head coach, Bowles is tamer and less bombastic than Ryan was on his quietest days, and maybe that's precisely what this team needed.There's more good news ahead, too. An early bye week allows Bowles to make crucial adjustments, and Pro Bowl defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson's return from suspension will bolster an already dominant front seven.

One of the proposals involves dropping a spacecraft, dubbed DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging), through Venus' atmosphere to study its composition. Another proposal would send a craft to map the surface of the planet in detail, to see how similar Venus’ surface is to Earth's and whether Venus was ever capable of habitation.The other three projects would focus on the study of asteroids and near-earth objects -- a term for anything floating in orbit around our planet, including meteoroids and old satellites.The investigations were selected from a pool of 27 submitted proposals for their ability to reveal new insights about the universe around us.“Dynamic and exciting missions like these hold promise to unravel the mysteries of our solar system and inspire future generations of explorers,” John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a statement. NASA's Discovery Program originally solicited proposals for its 13th mission in February 2014. NASA will give the team behind each project $3 million for research. The agency will then evaluate what the teams come up with and decide by September 2016 which mission to carry out. Whichever mission it selects is expected to cost about $500 million, not including the expense of post-launch operations. "

The medical examination he got after the encounter uncovered a tumor on his kidney.Finney was swimming off Huntington Beach when he felt something crash into his back, he told CBS Boston.“I’d never been hit like that before,” he said. “It was pretty jarring. It kind of gave me an instant whiplash.”Finney had no idea what it was at the time, but it left him “pretty much instantly in pain,” he told local news station WHDH.His daughter noticed his back was covered in blood when he got out of the water. As he was rinsing it off, lifeguards started evacuating the beach after spotting shark fins in the water. The next day a surfer at the same beach was attacked by a great white shark, according to the San Jose Mercury News.Finney was still experiencing severe pain in his upper body back home in Massachusetts days later. He went to a hospital, where doctors determined he had interior bruising caused by blunt-force trauma. But while conducting a CAT scan to help determine the source of Finney’s pain, doctors also noticed a small growth on his kidney. The growth turned out to be stage 1 cancer.Surgeons removed the tumor two weeks ago and say Finney is now completely cancer-free. But this might not have been the case if the shark bump hadn’t prompted him to seek medical attention.“If they hadn’t made this incidental find, I wouldn’t have known until it was too late,” he told the Mercury News.H/T: The DodoContact the author of this article at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.com"
9,POLITICS,This Ranking System Is Increasing Corporate Political Disclosure,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cpa-zicklin-index-2015_us_56159b37e4b021e856d3833e,Corporations are increasingly disclosing their contributions to dark money nonprofits and corporate lobbying groups.,2015-10-08,The 2015 CPA-Zicklin Index ranks the entire S&P 500 for the first time and reveals that companies are continuing to improve their transparency and accountability.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56166aef1200002e007e4a20.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Corporations are increasingly adopting policies that govern their participation in the political process, acting to voluntarily disclose political contributions and impose restrictions on donations.The findings come from the 2015 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, released Thursday by the Center for Political Accountability and The Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The index ranks corporations on a scale of zero to 100, based on their adoption and execution of political spending policies.Corporate political spending has become a hot button issue across the country ever since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision opened the door to unlimited corporate political spending, provided it remains independent from candidates themselves. While numerous campaign finance reform groups aim to push a variety of responses to the decision, from disclosure to amending the Constitution, the Center for Political Accountability directly engages corporations through shareholders to convince them to adopt political spending rules as part of their corporate social responsibility platform.The center has been pushing businesses to adopt political spending and transparency policies since 2003, and launched the index with the Zicklin Center in 2011. The 2015 CPA-Zicklin Index covers the entire Standard & Poor's 500 index for the first time. This is significant, because advocates believe the index has a critical role in driving corporations to adopt political spending policies, particularly transparency policies.“The S&P 500 companies are the most influential, biggest companies,” Center for Political Accountability President Bruce Freed said. “They have the wherewithal to spend and some of them have accepted, in principle, the fact that they need to address political spending.”The inclusion of the full S&P 500 means that companies rated for the first time can now see the index as a competitive measure of good corporate governance practices. Companies that have been included in the index for some time show significant improvement. Since the first index came out, the scores of the original 83 companies it examined rose from an average of 45.2 in 2011 to 71.3 in 2015. Scores for the 186 companies the index has tracked since 2012 have risen from an average of 38.1 to 59.4 this year.“I, quite honestly, think [the index] has helped drive behavior,” said Dan Bross, the senior director of corporate citizenship at Microsoft. “There is an increasing race to the top here.”Each company's score is an aggregate based on how well it has adopted and executed a range of policies, from simply having a stated policy and web page expressing a public sentiment on political spending to the disclosure of political and lobbying expenses.Medical technology company Becton, Dickinson and Company, transport company CSX Corporation and Noble Energy tied for the top score in 2015. ""Noble Energy is committed to conducting its business with integrity and transparency and applies this commitment to its stakeholder interactions and public disclosures,” Arnold Johnson, senior vice president of corporate affairs, general counsel and secretary of Noble Energy, said in a statement. “We are pleased that these efforts continue to be recognized in the Center for Political Accountability-Zicklin Index.”Edison International, Microsoft Corp. and Unum Group, a newcomer to the index, tied for second with a score of 95.7. Another 22 corporations received a score of at least 90, including Monsanto Co., Exelon Corp., Aflac Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and General Mills Inc.Whether or not shareholders have engaged a company on political spending appears to be a key factor in how well the company scores. Overall, shareholders have engaged 211 S&P 500 companies on the issue, and those companies have an average score of 60.7. The other 286 companies examined in the index had an average score of 24.4.One way companies receive a high score on the index is by adopting disclosure or restriction policies for contributions to trade associations and politically active 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofits. These types of groups have increased their spending on elections since the Citizens United decision, and are not being bound by campaign finance disclosure rules.The Center for Political Accountability's push to get corporations to disclose these contributions created a backlash from corporate trade associations led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers. These corporate lobbying groups have publicly and privately attacked the center and the index as a left-wing tool to silence corporations.Freed, however, looks at the continued uptick in corporate scores on the index and sees that these arguments are not resonating. “Companies are really not responding [to the attacks],” Freed said. “They’re ignoring it.”So far, 204 companies have adopted some kind of policy to fully or partially disclose trade association contributions. Currently, 124 companies disclose full or partial contributions to social welfare nonprofits.Bross said that he could not comment on positions of the Chamber and other trade associations attacking the index, but added, “I’m hard-pressed to think of a company who has stepped back and said, 'Because of this ranking and rating and because of this disclosure, we’re no longer going to engage in the political process.' I don’t know that that’s necessarily the case.”Read the whole report below:"

14,SPORTS,"Katie Nolan Challenges Greg Hardy, Media And The NFL To Do Better",Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/katie-nolan-greg-hardy-garbage-time_us_56169a52e4b0dbb8000d6bbb,"""It’s just like what are we f***ing doing? What matters to you?""",2015-10-08,Fox Sports 1 reporter Katie Nolan spoke out against Dallas Cowboy Greg Hardy's comments on Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56169b2712000026007e4aba.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the Dallas Cowboys take the field on Sunday for their fifth game of the year, they’ll be joined by Greg Hardy, the 27-year-old defensive end who was suspended for the first quarter of the season after he was convicted of assaulting and threatening to kill a former girlfriend.When speaking to reporters after his first practice Wednesday, Hardy did little to nothing to make it seem he was remorseful for his actions. Tired of the defensive end's attitude and what she sees as the media, Cowboys and NFL's implicit support for him, Fox Sports 1 television host Katie Nolan decided she's had enough on Wednesday. In a blistering monologue, Nolan called out all parties involved for how they have repeatedly mishandled Hardy's situation.  ""Greg Hardy had to pretend to respect women for 12 minutes. Just 12 minutes. And he couldn’t even do that,"" she said at one point. Nolan stressed the unseemliness of Hardy using the phrase “I hope I come out guns blazing” to describe his excitement for Sunday’s contest, citing the reported incident of Hardy throwing his girlfriend onto “a couch covered in assault rifles” as proof of the statement’s impropriety. Hardy -- just months removed from the domestic violence charges -- delivered the comments with a chuckle.""That [response] is baffling to me, and not just as a woman, but as a person who majored in public relations,” Nolan said on her show Wednesday. “How do you let that comment happen? Oh, I’m sorry, not just let it happen, publish it on the league’s official website, endorsing it with your precious shield, which, oh, I noticed has a pink ribbon on it this month because you care about women. That’s cool, thanks.”In a similar vein, when Hardy was asked by media members about facing the New England Patriots’ Tom Brady on Sunday, he spun the question on its head, electing to discuss Tom Brady’s supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen rather than on-field strategy for stopping the quarterback.“I love seeing Tom Brady, he’s cool as crap,” Hardy answered. “Have you seen his wife? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game, all her friends come to the game. One of my favorite games of the year, guys.” Nolan fired back with this, some of which is aforementioned:Greg Hardy had to pretend to respect women for 12 minutes. Just 12 minutes. And he couldn’t even do that. And what’s worse, no one stopped him. They let him go on about girlfriends and guns, and posted a video of it on DallasCowboys.com, because who f***ing cares -- women won’t see it, women only care about football during those events … where they [get told] what to cook on game day.""Finally, at the close of her monologue, Nolan took issue with a reporter asking Hardy whether he considers Jacksonville Jaguars’ “quarterback Blake Bortles’ significant other attractive” -- a comment that not only places ostensible value on Hardy’s opinion of women, but also seemingly condones his continual objectification of the opposite sex.Christ, guys. Enough. Enough. … It’s just like what are we f***ing doing, what matters to you? Seriously, what matters to you? Because expecting a garbage human, who has been punished for being garbage, to come back from his suspension and not immediately resume being garbage is asking the bare minimum. And if me asking that the league and the Cowboys and their PR people and the media could act with just a shred of human decency is ruining football for you, then I’m disappointed I guess in how much we’re willing to accept in order to protect our precious Sundays.It’s hard to argue with that.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said that Hardy is a defensive back, when he is actually a defensive end.

15,POLITICS,California Moves To Crack Down On Super PAC Coordination,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-super-pac_us_56156780e4b0cf9984d80b16,A state regulator steps up while federal action remains out of reach.,2015-10-07,"California's election regulator proposed new rules to crack down on coordination between political candidates and the outside groups, like super PACs, that have proliferated since the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5615684a1400008600bfc5e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Update: Oct. 15 -- The California Fair Political Practices Commission approved the new regulations governing coordination between campaigns and independent groups.Previously: WASHINGTON -- California’s election agency will vote at its upcoming meeting on new rules to crack down on coordination between candidates and outside groups like super PACs and non-disclosing nonprofits.New rules proposed by the Fair Political Practices Commission would redefine illegal coordination between candidates and outside groups supporting them to include: the operation of an outside group by former staff of the candidate, the employment of similar vendors across primary and general elections by both the candidate and group, the appearance of a candidate at a fundraising event for the group, the reliance of the group on significant contributions from the candidate’s family, and the republication of candidate materials obtained directly or indirectly by an outside group.The election regulator’s move to change the rules governing coordination is a major step toward limiting the most egregious examples of candidate and outside group collaboration that have been raised by campaign finance reformers and watchdogs. It also comes as federal election regulators have been incapable of adopting new rules to govern the increased spending by supposedly independent groups.As with federal races, ""independent"" spending in California elections has also skyrocketed. In 2014, the state’s race for school superintendent saw super PACs spend more than $26 million. Most of this money came from billionaire supporters of charter schools to back like-minded superintendent candidate Marshall Tuck. The rise of independent spending prompted the FPPC to get ahead of potential coordination problems before the issues plaguing federal elections metastasized within state elections.This rise in independent spending occurred after the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision opened the door to unlimited corporate and union independent spending. A subsequent lower court decision opened the door to unlimited individual spending and led to the creation of super PACs. These two decisions were predicated on the notion that the spending of these groups could not lead to the corruption or appearance of corruption for the supported candidates due to their “independence.”That independence, however, is based on an incredibly limited legal definition that the FPPC hopes to fix for the state of California.At both the federal and state levels, the supposed independence of groups has been tested. Candidates including Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Bobby Jindal personally raised millions of dollars for super PACs. Party leaders like Barack Obama, Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner appear at fundraising events for these groups. Most super PACs are run by former aides to the candidates they seek to support or, in the case of groups focused on congressional elections, former aides to party leadership. In a number of cases, family members have donated to or created their own super PACs to support kin running for office.These same trends toward collaboration and coordination at the national level play out in California, too. The FPPC has already fined a super PAC that supported the 2010 state legislative campaign of Luis Alejo for illegal campaign coordination after Alejo's campaign manager approved supportive mailers sent by a super PAC where the manager also held a principal position. Alejo's campaign was forced to pay back the cost of the mailers.The FPPC has also received at least one request for a ruling on whether an elected official can appear at a fundraiser for a group planning to spend money to attack the official’s opponents. Another request to the FPPC asked whether a district attorney candidate’s spouse could contribute $10,000 to a supposedly independent group supporting the candidate’s election.Among the new presumptions of coordination considered by the FPPC, the operation of an outside group by former staff would apply to staff who had worked in senior or advisory roles for the candidate “within 12 months prior to the date of the election in which the expenditure is made.”The commission will vote on the new rules at its next meeting on Oct. 15.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that the FPPC fined the legislative campaign of Luis Alejo. In fact the FPPC fined a super PAC that supported Alejo’s campaign."

How does anybody prepare for that? You can’t.""",2015-10-07,"LaBrasca's Pizza in Columbia, South Carolina, was surrounded by 4 feet of water during the flood on Oct. 4.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561558151400002900bfc5c6.jpeg?cache=IhkktTDC1U&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, LaBrasca's Pizza in Columbia, South Carolina, was gearing up to throw its 50th anniversary party. Today, it's facing the possibility of a going-out-of-business party. The restaurant is one of many local establishments ravaged by the deadly flooding that has ripped through the state since Sunday after record amounts of rainfall pummeled the region. Like most other small businesses and homeowners, the owners didn't have flood insurance.“This restaurant has been here for 50 years and nothing has ever happened where we’d ever consider needing flood insurance,"" said Milly Knuckley, who runs LaBrasca's Pizza in Columbia with her fiancé and restaurant owner Brett Wilson. ""We knew there was going to be rain and flash floods, but we didn’t know that [the dam at Fort Jackson] was going to burst and come wash our restaurant away. How do you prepare for that? How does anybody prepare for that? You can’t.""The disaster, characterized by Gov. Nikki Haley (R) as a once-in-1,000-year disaster, is something few small-business owners in the state were insured against, said Frank Knapp Jr., president and CEO of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce. Flood damage is usually only covered by a separate policy that businesses and homeowners must purchase through the National Flood Insurance Program, which reports fewer than 200,000 policies exist in South Carolina. Knuckley said she'd be surprised if any of the other businesses in her shopping center were insured. Like her, she said, they didn't think flooding this destructive was possible in that location.""It was like a nightmare. First you’re hit with denial, and you’re like, ‘Well, it can’t be that bad,'"" she said, describing when she first realized the flooding would hit the restaurant. The reality didn't hit until her fiancé made his way there on Sunday. ""He’s 6 foot, 3 inches and he was in waist-deep water trying to get into our restaurant.""On the first day of sunshine on Tuesday, Knuckley, Wilson and friends were trying to save anything they could. ""Right now we’re just trying to clean up the mud,"" she said. ""We had to rip everything up; our carpet’s all laid out in the back of the restaurant right now ... We have booths and tables that were under water. We have them out in the sun right now hoping we can salvage them. We had to throw out food. All our paper goods, boxes, all had to be thrown away because it was contaminated. We’ve lost some equipment ... Our ceiling tiles are starting to fall in right now.”She's grateful that the water didn't reach high enough to destroy their gas pizza oven and that several staffers and customers have showed up to help. “I even had an employee’s 8-year-old daughter here bleaching booths and stuff for me out back in the sun trying to stop mold from forming on everything so that we could try to save it,” she said, adding that many patrons have stopped by to help with cleanup efforts. “I’ve had so many in here that I’ve had to turn customers away and told them that I would call them when I could.”Knuckley said she has no idea what will happen next, but they're exploring different options. ""One of our customers said she was going to start a fund for us,"" she said. ""That’s pretty much what it’s come to. We’re depending on the generosity of others because we’re not a big franchise.""It wouldn't be an easy goodbye; the restaurant has been part of the family for a long time. Her fiancé worked for the original owner at LaBrasca's when he was in high school and bought the restaurant from him 20 years ago. ""We’re just a small mom-and-pop shop that’s praying this doesn’t put us out of business,"" she said. Cynthia McHale, the director of insurance at the sustainability nonprofit Ceres, emphasized that experts are warning that climate change will exacerbate the frequency and intensity of these types of storms, so businesses need to start preparing for a changing reality. ""It's really gargantuan, it really is,"" McHale told The Huffington Post earlier this week of climate risks. ""I understand that businesses confront a lot of challenges and have a wide range of risks, but this is large and it is growing. It's just one you can't ignore."" "

Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) is set to back Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential bid on Friday, giving the independent a boost in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The Los Angeles Times first reported Wednesday that Grijalva would announce his support for Sanders' campaign at a rally in Tucson, Arizona. It will be Sanders' first endorsement from a member of Congress. Grijalva is the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which Sanders helped found in 1991. He is also a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Endorsements tend to be an excellent predictor of who will win in a party primary. In that regard, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is crushing her competition, with more than 100 endorsements from members of the House and Senate. Since Sanders has said that Democrats need ""a movement which takes on the economic and political establishment, not one which is part of it,"" it is perhaps not surprising that the Democratic establishment he often rails against isn't on board. Sanders now matches former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley in endorsement numbers. California Rep. Eric Swalwell (D) endorsed O'Malley in July. Vice President Joe Biden, who is rumored to be close to announcing whether he will enter the primary, has endorsements from two members of Congress from his home state of Delaware, plus the state's governor. In Sanders' home state, Peter Shumlin, Vermont's Democratic governor, and Patrick Leahy (D), the state's other senator, have both endorsed Clinton. HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates all publicly available polling data, has Clinton leading the field with 43.5 percent of the vote, to Sanders' 25.3 percent and Biden's 20 percent."
18,SPORTS,It's Time For The Eagles To Cut Ties With Chip Kelly,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chip-kelly-eagles_us_56141d54e4b0368a1a615cf9,"Philadelphia, at 1-3, ranks 30th in offense and 30th on third down.",2015-10-07,Chip Kelly's Eagles missed the playoffs last year and his team has stumbled to a disappointing 1-3 start in 2015.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561438b11600002d00038368.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The leash on the Philadelphia Eagles' Chip Kelly has run out of slack. Amid a 1-3 start to the season, one of the offseason's busiest and most anticipated teams has been snakebitten by Kelly's ineptitude as both a head coach and de facto general manager. For those who don't know just how poor Kelly's football acumen has been, let us go over the basic facts.He didn't want LeSean McCoy anymore, even though McCoy seems like the ideal fit for everything Kelly wants to run and once told The Huffington Post how much he believed in his coach. Kelly didn't think Jeremy Maclin's 1,300-plus yards and 10 touchdowns were necessary for his offense, nor did he think that Nick Foles -- 14-4 as a starter -- was good enough to run his system. Then came the trade for Sam Bradford -- 18-30-1 as a starter -- despite Bradford having a quarterback rating nearly 20 points less. Kelly also thought second-year wideout Jordan Matthews (with 281 yards and one touchdown so far this season) could instantly develop into a No. 1 receiver and that Nelson Agholor (seven catches this season) -- whom he nabbed 20th overall in the draft -- would become a playmaking burner. Maybe both will live up to such promise. But if they don't, Kelly will be at fault because they were his guys and he assumed plugging both in to his system would work immediately and seamlessly.Bradford has been a colossal disappointment for a multitude of reasons, perhaps most glaringly in the sense that his calling card of being an accurate quarterback -- according to Kelly, at least -- hasn't rung true. Completing just 60.7 percent of his passes, Bradford has looked extremely uncomfortable in the pocket and hasn't been able to read coverages. He has had little success throwing the ball down the field and he's been far too indecisive for a guy running a quick strike, spread offense. The 27-year-old ranks 19th in yards and 24th in quarterback rating. Kelly, who was given total control by ownership last January, may be most at fault for his arrogance and insistence that his system make the player and not the other way around. It's the reason both McCoy and Maclin are gone, and it's the reason he committed nearly $55 million to two running backs without seeming to have a legitimate plan in mind for how to actually use either one.DeMarco Murray, last year's rushing leader and a first-team All-Pro with Dallas, was on the field for fewer than half of the Eagles offensive plays during a Week 4 loss to Washington. In fact, his 47 rushing yards -- for the season -- rank 81st in the league, behind 12 quarterbacks, including pocket statues like Ryan Fitzpatrick, Jameis Winston and Jay Cutler. That's right: Jay Cutler -- who, by the way, has played in only three games.""Do I think I'm touching the ball [enough]?"" Murray said following the loss to Washington. ""No, I'm not. I don't think I am. But it's the plays that are being called.""Ryan Mathews would have every right to take same tone, as he's been on the field even less than Murray. He has a measly 33 carries despite being known as a workhorse back. (He had 285 carries during his last full season of health in 2013 with San Diego.)Following highly productive offensive stints at both New Hampshire and Oregon, along with a record-setting first NFL season, the 51-year-old Kelly has always been known as an innovative mind and offensive guru. And while there's no denying that, it's also hard to argue that he has not been putting the Eagles in a losing position this season. In fact, his offense has failed to score in half of the quarters played during the four games this season. The Eagles are 30th in the NFL in offense, 29th in yards per play and 30th on third down. Moreover, they averaged nearly 420 yards in Kelly’s first season and just under 400 last year. In four games thus far, Kelly's offense is producing fewer than 300 yards.Kelly, to his credit, hasn't thrown his players -- even the ones that are underperforming -- under the bus. And it's not as if the NFC East is a stockpile of dangerous teams. ""We know we have the right players here,"" he said following the Washington game. ""I’m really not worried about this group."" That may be true, but what's also true is this: Kelly is not the right man to lead this franchise. Firing him won't fix all of Philly's problems, but it will fix one of its biggest ones.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.
