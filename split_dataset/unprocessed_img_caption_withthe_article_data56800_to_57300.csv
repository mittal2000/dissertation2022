0,MEDIA,New York Times In 'Final Stage' Of Selecting Next Public Editor,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-public-editor_us_5739d5c1e4b060aa781ab91a,Veteran journalists Debra Adams Simmons and Elizabeth Spayd are said to be among the finalists.,2016-05-16,The New York Times is close to selecting its next public editor. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_12_2000_1042%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- The New York Times is close to selecting its next public editor, nearly three months after Margaret Sullivan announced she was leaving the publication for The Washington Post.Details of the selection process, led by standards editor Phil Corbett, have been closely held within the Times. A spokeswoman for the paper told The Huffington Post that the Times is in the “final stage” of its search, but declined to comment on the number of candidates in the mix. Veteran journalists Debra Adams Simmons and Elizabeth Spayd are among those still being considered, sources familiar with the process told HuffPost. Simmons is the former editor of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and most recently served as vice president of Advance Local, a division of Advance Publications. She has spent the past academic year studying the “impact of the digital news transformation on newsroom leadership and diversity, media ethics and local communities” as a fellow at Harvard University's Nieman Foundation for Journalism. Spayd spent 25 years at The Washington Post, beginning as an editor on the business desk and ascending to managing editor, the No. 2 position in the newsroom. In November 2013, she was named editor-in-chief and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, which has looked critically at the media for more than half a century. Neither Simmons nor Spayd responded to a request for comment. The Times' search committee cast a wide net for this influential perch and approached a number of prominent journalists. One candidate was Greg Moore, who led The Denver Post for 14 years before resigning in March. He withdrew early in the process, and told HuffPost recently that he was flattered to be considered but plans to remain in Colorado.Times chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. will make the final decision on candidates chosen by the search committee. Sulzberger said in February that it would be a “difficult task” to replace Sullivan and that the process was “already well underway.” A former top editor of the Buffalo News, Sullivan in 2012 became the Times' fifth public editor, a position created in the wake of the Jayson Blair plagiarism scandal. She took the role into the digital age by responding quickly to Times controversies in her blog and on Twitter, in addition to writing a print column. She was also the first woman to hold the position.Sullivan was slated to leave the Times in August at the end of a four-year term, but joined the Post ahead of schedule as a media columnist. Sullivan left the Times in April and started at the Post on Monday."
1,POLITICS,A Notorious Washington Lobbyist Wants To Raise Money For Trump,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-lobbyist_us_573a36cee4b060aa781b04c8,Jack Burkman admits it's about getting business during a Trump administration.,2016-05-16,Donald Trump doesn't like K Street. But K Street wants to raise some cash for him anyway.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573a396d130000d605381be6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What do you do if you're a Republican lobbyist and your party's presumptive presidential nominee thinks your industry is abominable? If you're an enterprising influence-peddler like the semi-notorious Jack Burkman, you throw a fundraiser without the candidate's consent, raise as much as possible, and hope it gets you in the door if the nominee becomes desperate for cash.Burkman will host what he calls ""The First General Election Fundraiser for Donald J. Trump for President"" on June 1. He hopes to raise as much as $300,000.Burkman has a penchant for pursuing headlines with as much vigor as he chases clients. He is, among other things, infamous for spearheading a quixotic congressional effort to ban gay players from the NFL -- a campaign made even odder by the facts that, one, his own brother is gay, and, two, lobbyists don't get to openly introduce legislation. When it comes to Burkman's support of Trump, skepticism seems warranted. Burkman, after all, supported Jeb Bush early in the Republican primary -- a candidate whose humiliation at the hands of Trump was so severe that Bush refuses to back him. Burkman even took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Daily News calling Trump a joke. But there's politics, and there's political business. And Burkman isn't one to let emotional hang-ups get in the way of things like access. Asked if he was hosting the fundraiser as a means of opening doors during a Trump administration, he was refreshingly frank. ""Of course,"" Burkman said in an interview. ""You bet. Of course we do. That's my business."" Apparently, enough people are of the same mindset to form a minyan. Burkman said he expects 150 to 200 government affairs professionals and about 100 defense contractors for his soiree. Ralph Palmieri, a defense contractor (formerly of Lockheed and Sytex), was one name Burkman's spokesman sent as proof that others were indeed attending. Palmieri didn't immediately return a request for comment. As presidential candidates go, Trump is a tricky one for lobbyists to get behind. For starters, he publicly admonishes them and their ilk. He spent the primary calling his GOP opponents puppets of influence-peddlers and made a big show of how he self-funded his candidacy (which wasn't actually true, of course, since many donations were coming into his campaign). Burkman is betting that the demands of a general election will make the real estate tycoon reconsider. Trump is, after all, notoriously thrifty. Perhaps he will change his views -- shocking as that may be -- when it becomes clear that he may have to liquidate a building or two to win the presidency. ""He needs to start,"" said Burkman. ""It is already going into June and, as a good Republican, I know this has to get moving or there is not going to be enough time to compete with Clinton. ... Trump has to, he has to get moving.""Trump could, of course, simply refuse to take Burkman's cash; or, more realistically, refund it should he not want to partake in the kind of influence-peddling scheme that he once denounced. But Burkman said he didn't expect a rebuke like that. And he has good reason not to. After all, Trump went from lashing out at casino magnate Sheldon Adelson for funding Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to praising Adelson when he announced he'd put $100 million behind Trump's bid. Even if Trump said no, Burkman said he'd consider launching a super PAC with money from lobbyists and defense contractors to aid the nominee. Trump, he admitted, was a potential meal ticket. But Burkman stressed that there were elements to the candidate that attracted him, too. There was the fact that Trump reminded Burkman of, well, himself (""He's kind of like a lobbyist""). And then there was one of Trump's most controversial moments during the campaign, which shocked most people, but apparently was inspiring to others. ""I really liked him on the issue when he took on Megyn Kelly in the first debate,"" said Burkman. ""I think he came very close to winning the Republican nomination the first time he spoke on the stage. You remember, Megyn Kelly hit him with a long litany of feminist stuff and he used three words. He said, 'Only Rosie O'Donnell.'""I think the whole Republican base stood up in unison in that moment and said, 'We have a leader.' That's what did it for me.""Oh, and for the record, Burkman still believes gay football players should be banned from the NFL.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Schonberg, who is the editor-in-chief of the theater website, Center on the Aisle, praised Benanti as “an incredible talent and one of the kindest and most giving people in the industry” and called the collaboration “an honor.” The show quickly sold out, but segments will be streamed live on the venue's official Facebook page and Center on the Aisle's official Facebook page.

Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) to the House appropriations committee.It urged the committee to remove a provision requiring the Library of Congress to use the terms “aliens” and “illegal aliens” in its subject headings.“Terms and how they are defined by society change with time. As meanings of words evolve with the times, so should our usage of those terms,” the letter reads.The letter went on to say that “dated and dehumanizing terms such as ‘illegal alien’ and ‘alien’ have taken on a highly negative connotation and perpetuate the denigration of immigrant communities.""This March, the Library of Congress made the decision to use the term “noncitizens” in place of “aliens” in subject headings and to replace “illegal alien” with “noncitizen” and “unauthorized immigration.” Some Republicans balked at that change.House appropriations committee chairman Tom Graves (R-Ga.) argued that the subcommittee was not making a political statement surrounding the terminology, but rather attempting to ensure the language chosen by the Library of Congress matches that of the U.S. legal code.Despite the Library of Congress' decision to eliminate the language, the appropriators included a provision in the legislative branch funding proposal for the 2017 fiscal year that would force the Library of Congress to use the term.“In the past, as society has come to understand the pain certain words can cause communities, we’ve done the right thing and eliminated those terms from our acceptable vocabulary,” Castro said in a press statement. “The Appropriations Committee should continue that progress now, not move our nation backwards and unnecessarily perpetuate a negative stigma.”"

Trump also tenderly cups the back of Putin's neck with his hand.The eatery's co-owner, Dominykas Čečkauskas, unveiled the piece on Thursday. Images of the graffiti are going viral, with dozens of locals showing up to pose in front of the multi-colored picture.Bonanu's satirical piece is a riff on ""My God, Help Me To Survive This Deadly Love"" graffiti, which Dmitri Vrubel painted on the side of the Berlin Wall in 1990:It depicts former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev kissing East German leader Erich Honecker, and is itself a take on the ""Socialist Fraternal Kiss"" photograph, taken some 11 years earlier, which showed the pair embracing and kissing each other on the lips.Despite receiving an avalanche of global attention for his latest work, Bonanu told CNN that nothing in his life had changed -- ""except that now I have full pocket of food coupons to eat in Keule Ruke.""Čečkauskas and Bonanu said they both saw ""similarities between Trump and Putin."" ""They both have an ego that is too big, and it is funny that they get along well,"" Čečkauskas told the Baltic News Service. ""We are in a sort of a Cold War again, and America may get a president who will want to be friends with Russia.""Although Bonanu's work is not strictly an anti-Trump piece, multiple street artists, such as the London-based Pegasus, have protested the billionaire real estate magnate's presidential campaign in recent months.Pegasus, originally from Chicago, claimed his piece likening The Donald to Adolf Hitler led to him receiving numerous death threats from Trump supporters.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

His view is especially popular among Americans skeptical of the elites who shape U.S. foreign policy. That's why American politicians generally try to distance themselves from the most widely condemned product of that policy, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Hillary Clinton’s vote in favor of the war is a big reason she lost the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. And this year, as Clinton again tries to play defense on that vote, political hopefuls wanting to show they are different from the establishment are making the same argument Putin did back in September. Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the anti-establishment stars of 2016, have both bashed U.S. policies for enabling the rise of the self-styled Islamic State. Trump has directly accused President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Clinton of ""creating ISIS,"" implying the group grew from Obama's policy of supporting nationalist Syrian rebels opposed to dictator Bashar Assad. Though Sanders has stopped short of that claim, the Democratic hopeful has associated Clinton with ISIS by talking about the militant group as a product of the Iraq war and U.S. military intervention in Libya in 2011. Bush's Iraq war and Obama's disastrous political mismanagement of the Iraqi state did offer radical militants space to operate, thousands of unhappy potential recruits, and weak targets to attack to gain advanced American weaponry. But by focusing on only those reasons for ISIS's success, critics of American foreign policy are adopting the same view they ascribe to Clinton and other interventionists: that the U.S. is responsible for everything. Putin's particular style of disinformation relies heavily on that assumption to sow international distrust of American actions. Now a fascinating report from Reuters challenges it. It turns Putin's question back at him: Do you realize what you have done?The news agency revealed on Friday that the Russian government has had a deliberate policy of sending radicalized Islamists out of Russia -- which means they inevitably end up in the central hub of militant extremism, Syria. In one case, officials allowed a militant placed under house arrest to make it to Moscow's international airport and start a journey that would end in his joining ISIS's ranks. In five of the instances Reuters tracked, ""Russian authorities had reason to deny [radicals] travel documents and prevent them from leaving the country. But according to relatives and local officials, in each case the authorities made their passage possible.""Putin's government adopted this policy in the run-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi because of its fear that radical Islamists would target the marquee event. The scheme ran at least until then, Reuters reported. But it had important consequences regardless of when it ended: A local police officer told the news agency that dozens more Russian radicals left the country after their fellow extremists reached Syria and encouraged them to make the same journey. Again, the militants were able to leave even though Russian authorities had flagged them as individuals of concern.Thousands of terrorists of Russian origin are now thought to be operating in Syria.Putin's spokesman denied the revelations. ""Terrorists get annihilated in Russia,"" he told Reuters. ""It has always been like that, it is like that and it will be in the future.”But the findings aren't surprising given Russia's general approach in Syria and its policies toward radical Islamists at home. Putin and Russia-friendly Assad have long described the Syrian conflict as a fight between a government and an irredeemably extreme foreign-funded opposition, rather than the product of millions of Syrians' frustration with violent authoritarian rule.Assad has done his best to make that false binary a reality. His forces have avoided attacking ISIS-controlled areas, even concluding land swaps with the militant group, as they have targeted more moderate groups in the opposition who present a viable alternative to Assad or ISIS for Syria's future. He has repeatedly released hardcore prisoners, including extremists once nurtured by his own security agencies. And his government has boosted ISIS coffers by buying oil from the radical group.Reuters' new report shows that Putin adopted the same approach -- likely making a similar calculation that allowing extremists to gain power was acceptable if it would make the Assad regime look like the best option in Syria. For Russia, the policy had the added benefit of moving potential threats far away.

8,THE WORLDPOST,Vladimir Putin's America-Friendly Propaganda About Fighting Terror Just Suffered A Big Blow,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russias-propaganda-about-fighting-terror-just-suffered-a-big-blow_us_57364919e4b077d4d6f32cbd,"Putin tries to present himself as the best bet against ISIS. In reality, he's helped it thrive.",2016-05-16,Putin made headlines worldwide by blaming the U.S. for Middle East chaos in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The last time he visited the U.S., in September of 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin brought the ideal message for war-weary observers of U.S. foreign policy.At the United Nations' annual General Assembly, he indicated he wanted to address international players involved in the Middle East -- the most prominent of which, of course, is the U.S. In the region now, Putin said, ""nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.""""I cannot help asking those who have caused the situation: Do you realize now what you have done?""Putin's message resonates in an America that believes most of the chaos in the Middle East is a result of U.S. actions. His view is especially popular among Americans skeptical of the elites who shape U.S. foreign policy. That's why American politicians generally try to distance themselves from the most widely condemned product of that policy, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Hillary Clinton’s vote in favor of the war is a big reason she lost the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. And this year, as Clinton again tries to play defense on that vote, political hopefuls wanting to show they are different from the establishment are making the same argument Putin did back in September. Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the anti-establishment stars of 2016, have both bashed U.S. policies for enabling the rise of the self-styled Islamic State. Trump has directly accused President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Clinton of ""creating ISIS,"" implying the group grew from Obama's policy of supporting nationalist Syrian rebels opposed to dictator Bashar Assad. Though Sanders has stopped short of that claim, the Democratic hopeful has associated Clinton with ISIS by talking about the militant group as a product of the Iraq war and U.S. military intervention in Libya in 2011. Bush's Iraq war and Obama's disastrous political mismanagement of the Iraqi state did offer radical militants space to operate, thousands of unhappy potential recruits, and weak targets to attack to gain advanced American weaponry. But by focusing on only those reasons for ISIS's success, critics of American foreign policy are adopting the same view they ascribe to Clinton and other interventionists: that the U.S. is responsible for everything. Putin's particular style of disinformation relies heavily on that assumption to sow international distrust of American actions. Now a fascinating report from Reuters challenges it. It turns Putin's question back at him: Do you realize what you have done?The news agency revealed on Friday that the Russian government has had a deliberate policy of sending radicalized Islamists out of Russia -- which means they inevitably end up in the central hub of militant extremism, Syria. In one case, officials allowed a militant placed under house arrest to make it to Moscow's international airport and start a journey that would end in his joining ISIS's ranks. In five of the instances Reuters tracked, ""Russian authorities had reason to deny [radicals] travel documents and prevent them from leaving the country. But according to relatives and local officials, in each case the authorities made their passage possible.""Putin's government adopted this policy in the run-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi because of its fear that radical Islamists would target the marquee event. The scheme ran at least until then, Reuters reported. But it had important consequences regardless of when it ended: A local police officer told the news agency that dozens more Russian radicals left the country after their fellow extremists reached Syria and encouraged them to make the same journey. Again, the militants were able to leave even though Russian authorities had flagged them as individuals of concern.Thousands of terrorists of Russian origin are now thought to be operating in Syria.Putin's spokesman denied the revelations. ""Terrorists get annihilated in Russia,"" he told Reuters. ""It has always been like that, it is like that and it will be in the future.”But the findings aren't surprising given Russia's general approach in Syria and its policies toward radical Islamists at home. Putin and Russia-friendly Assad have long described the Syrian conflict as a fight between a government and an irredeemably extreme foreign-funded opposition, rather than the product of millions of Syrians' frustration with violent authoritarian rule.Assad has done his best to make that false binary a reality. His forces have avoided attacking ISIS-controlled areas, even concluding land swaps with the militant group, as they have targeted more moderate groups in the opposition who present a viable alternative to Assad or ISIS for Syria's future. He has repeatedly released hardcore prisoners, including extremists once nurtured by his own security agencies. And his government has boosted ISIS coffers by buying oil from the radical group.Reuters' new report shows that Putin adopted the same approach -- likely making a similar calculation that allowing extremists to gain power was acceptable if it would make the Assad regime look like the best option in Syria. For Russia, the policy had the added benefit of moving potential threats far away. Putin's government has struggled with how to handle radicalization among Russia's millions-strong Muslim population, and its primary response -- severe crackdowns and violations of human rights -- has simply encouraged more radicalization. This means that in spite of Moscow's slick #RussiaVsISIL propaganda campaign, designed to present its military intervention in Syria as a fight against the best-known radical group there, there's growing evidence that Putin is helping ISIS thrive.The new reporting doesn’t even account for how Putin has helped the group recruit fighters worldwide by supporting Assad's butchery.

9,POLITICS,Trey Gowdy's Former Top Lawyer Undercuts The Benghazi Committee,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trey-gowdy-dana-chipman-benghazi-committee_us_5738db52e4b08f96c18373e2,The former general said he believed military officials did everything they could to save four Americans.,2016-05-16,"Leon Panetta, center, testified to the Benghazi Committee on Jan. 8, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_28_84_4660_1706%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Shortly before the House Benghazi committee ramped up its battles with the Department of Defense in its probe of the 2012 terrorist attack, the committee's own top lawyer admitted at least four times in interviews with military officials that there was no more they could have done on that tragic night.That's according to a letter obtained by The Huffington Post that was sent Sunday to the chairman of the committee, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), from the top Democrats on the Benghazi panel and the House Armed Services Committee, Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Adam Smith (D-Wash.).The Democrats are sending the letter after relations between the GOP-led Benghazi committee and military officials recently took a turn for the worse. The military accused the committee late last month of demanding increasingly frivolous interviews from irrelevant service members; Gowdy responded by calling that charge a ""partisan attack.""But in Monday's letter, which includes four separate comments from Gowdy's recently departed chief counsel, Democrats say Gowdy's own staffer agreed with the military.According to the letter, that staffer, former Gen. Dana Chipman, said in interviews with former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and former Defense Department Chief of Staff Jeremy Bash that the department did all it could on that night when Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.""I think you ordered exactly the right forces to move out and to head toward a position where they could reinforce what was occurring in Benghazi or in Tripoli or elsewhere in the region,"" Chipman told Panetta in the committee's January interview with the former defense secretary, according to transcribed excerpts. ""And, sir, I don’t disagree with the actions you took, the recommendations you made, and the decisions you directed.”Chipman was similarly deferential to Bash.""I would posit that from my perspective, having looked at all the materials over the last 18 months, we could not have affected the response to what occurred by 5:15 in the morning on the 12th of September in Benghazi, Libya,"" said Chipman, who himself served 33 years in the Army. “I don’t see any way to influence what occurred there,"" he told Bash at another point. ""But what I am worried about is we’re caught by surprise on 9/11, we’ve got nothing postured to respond in a timely manner — and you can debate what’s timely, what’s untimely, but nothing could have affected what occurred in Benghazi.”That interview was also in January. Chipman left the committee not long after. His statements appear to confirm the general findings of the eight previous investigations into Benghazi, which found flaws in readiness and coordination but no signs of wrongdoing. Those reports also repeatedly debunked rumors that the military was ordered to stand down.But after Chipman's departure, the Defense Department noted in its recent complaint, requests to interview people based on things such as Facebook posts and allegations on talk radio shows started to spike. Those commenters, on the air and online, generally seek to revive some sort of stand-down scenario. Gowdy has said that it's his obligation to seek out all sources of information, including from rank-and-file service members, not just the people who gave the orders that night.In a statement provided by the committee, Chipman said he backed Gowdy's dogged pursuit of fresh witnesses, although he did not contradict his comments mentioned in the Democrats' letter.""I agree with Chairman Gowdy. If some witnesses refer the committee to other witnesses, the responsible thing to do is interview them,"" Chipman said. ""The committee has an obligation to the American people to determine what can and cannot be substantiated, so if an individual makes public allegations about Benghazi, the committee should interview that person.”A spokesman for the committee, Matt Wolking, added that the letter and the excerpted statements from the general were more examples of the Democrats' partisan attempts to curb the real progress the probe is making.“No matter how many dishonest letters Democrats waste time writing, Republicans will continue conducting a thorough, fact-centered investigation that includes all relevant witnesses, regardless of rank,"" Wolking said.He also argued that the committee has made progress, despite the minority party's efforts.""Democrats have peddled the same politically motivated, predetermined conclusions from the very beginning, so it’s no surprise they’re still clinging to their false claim everything has been ‘asked and answered,’ even after the Pentagon admitted the map it previously provided to the committee showing the forces available on the night of the attacks was incomplete,"" Wolking said. ""Democrats’ false attacks on legitimate congressional oversight are proof they’re nervous about the new information committee investigators have uncovered.”Chipman is not the first former staffer to cause heartburn for Gowdy. A military investigator who was fired from the committee accused it of running a ""partisan investigation.""The Benghazi committee has been working for more than two years and has cost about $7 million and counting. Democrats estimate that other government entities have spent about $13 million more responding to the committee's requests.And while it's interviewed some 100 witnesses, its most notable revelation has been that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton conducted her State Department business on her personal email server. The FBI is investigating whether she violated any laws.This story was updated to include comments from Chipman and the committee."

It was the first time a Swedish court had awarded damages to victims of genocide.An estimated 800,000 people, mostly of the Tutsi ethnic minority but also moderates of the ethnic group Hutu, were killed by Hutus over three months in 1994 after years of civil war. The massacres raised questions about the ability or will of international organizations or states to intervene to halt mass killings of civilians.According to the Stockholm court verdict, Berinkindi, who arrived in Sweden in 2002 and became a Swedish citizen in 2012, was convicted in absentia of genocide-related crimes by a Rwandan Gacaca community court in 2007.He was charged in Sweden in September 2015.The district court ruling can be appealed.A number of Rwandan genocide-related crimes have been tried in recent years in Rwanda and other countries.In 2013, a Swedish court sentenced another man to life in prison for genocide in Rwanda in 1994. It was the first time a person in Sweden had been convicted of genocide.Last month, a Rwandan court handed a life sentence to a former senior politician for hate speech aimed at stirring up killings of Tutsis during the genocide."

""It would be interesting to look him in the eye as he explains and a win for all voices if we can come to a place of real trust with this powerful tool,"" Beck wrote on Facebook. A Facebook spokesman confirmed the meeting to The Huffington Post. Dana Perino, former White House press secretary under George W. Bush and current Fox News co-host, and Zac Moffatt, former digital director for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and co-founder of digital strategy firm Targeted Victory, are also confirmed to attend, according to the spokesman.Gizmodo reported Monday that Facebook news curators ""routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers"" by not including them in its trending news feed. The small group of editors was also said to have injected topics such as Black Lives Matter into the module even if they were not popular enough to enter the module organically through the site's algorithms.The allegations of bias sparked a firestorm in conservative media. They also raised broader questions about how little is publicly known about the way in which Facebook distributes news -- even as the site has emerged as the world's most influential news source and increasingly partners with major media outlets. Though Facebook doesn't identify its editors, like a traditional news organization might on a public masthead, the Guardian reported last week that these workers play a key role in selecting trending stories potentially seen by millions. Facebook disputed the bias allegations coming from former workers. ""We take these reports extremely seriously, and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true,"" the company's vice president of search, Tom Stocky, wrote Tuesday on Facebook. Stocky specifically said the claim that curators improperly pushed Black Lives Matter into the trending news feed was untrue. ""We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so,"" he wrote.Zuckerberg on Thursday wrote that Facebook was ""conducting a full investigation to ensure our teams upheld the integrity of this product."" He said no evidence of bias had so far been discovered. Zuckerberg also announced plans to invite ""leading conservatives and people from across the political spectrum to talk with me about this and share their points of view.""""I want to have a direct conversation about what Facebook stands for and how we can be sure our platform stays as open as possible,"" he wrote.

On Sunday, the actress addressed past accusations of sexual abuse against the director in a discussion with Geena Davis during Variety and Kering's Women in Motion talk at the Cannes Film festival. ""I think he sexually assaulted a child and I don’t think that’s right,” Sarandon said. ""I have nothing good to say about him. I don’t want to go there.”Sarandon's comments come just after Blake Lively, star of Allen's latest film, ""Café Society,"" called the director ""empowering to women."" ""It’s amazing what Woody has written for women,” Lively told the Los Angeles Times, noting that the accusations against the director had no influence on her decision to work with him. “It’s very dangerous to factor in things you don’t know anything about. I could [only] know my experience. And my experience with Woody is he’s empowering to women,” she said. The controversy surrounding Allen's past made the news again last week after his son, Ronan Farrow, published a piece in The Hollywood Reporter. Farrow criticized the media for ignoring allegations against the director and choosing not to ask him tough questions.Allen's estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow, maintains he sexually assaulted her when she was a child. She went public with her story for the first time in a 2014 op-ed in the New York Times. No charges were ever pursued, and Allen has consistently denied the allegations.During the Cannes opening ceremony Wednesday, French comedian Laurent Lafitte also referenced Allen's past by making a rape joke at the director's expense. And while the joke offended Lively, Allen seemed unfazed. “I’m completely in favor of comedians making any jokes they want,” Allen said at a luncheon during the festival. “I am a nonjudgmental, non-censorship person on jokes. I’m a comic myself, and I feel they should be free to make whatever jokes they want.”“I’m never offended,” he added. “It would take a lot to offend me.”"

He won't release his tax returns. Reince Priebus: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,2016-05-15,RNC Chairman Reince Priebus doesn't think people will care about reports of Donald Trump mistreating women.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Sunday said voters don't care about reports that the party’s presumptive presidential nominee has disrespected women and made unwelcome advances toward them in the workplace.A New York Times investigation published Saturday included dozens of interviews with women and men who worked with Donald Trump over decades, detailing crude comments about the female form, disturbing workplace conduct and more. ""All these stories that come out -- and they come out every couple weeks -- people just don't care,"" Priebus said when questioned about the NYT report on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I think people look at Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and say, 'Who's going to bring an earthquake to D.C.?'""Fox anchor Chris Wallace took another stab at the question, appearing flummoxed that Priebus assumed no one cares.""The question is whether or not he mistreated women, made unwanted advances, whether he humiliated women in the workplace -- I don't know why you say people don't care about that,"" Wallace said.Priebus backtracked a bit, explaining that given Trump's rise, he's not sure it will impact the candidate one way or another. ""All I'm saying is that after a year of different stories, nothing applies,"" Priebus said. ""The bigger question is: Between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, who represents somebody who is going to bring a more efficient, accountable, effective government here in Washington?""According to Gallup tracking, 70 percent of women had an unfavorable opinion of Trump as of March. The same poll showed that 58 percent of men have unfavorable views of the business mogul.Asked how Republicans would be able to convince female voters to back Trump given his misogynist comments, and history, Priebus said each individual will have to evaluate Trump based on the answers he gives about his past, but again quickly pivoted to focus on Clinton.“But also look at what’s at stake in this country and whether or not Hillary Clinton represents someone that’s going to bring the needed change,"" Priebus said when pressed on Trump's character.Priebus reasoned that the ""same old analysis"" and vetting of candidates just doesn't apply to Trump. ""Look, a story of 30 years ago and whether Donald Trump impersonated someone or not, that he denies, is really not the most important thing for us to talk about,"" he said, referring to reports that Trump pretended to be his publicist. Does Trump need to release his tax returns? Again, Priebus assumed it wasn't a real concern for voters: ""I'm not sure whether Americans actually care or not whether Donald Trump releases his tax returns or not.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

The ship was about 200 miles southeast of Galveston.Broberg's traveling companions reported her missing to the ship's personnel around noon Friday, a Carnival spokeswoman said on Sunday. About five hours later, ship officials confirmed her fall with video and contacted the Coast Guard, rescue officials said.""The camera footage indicates that the guest was sitting on a deck railing and fell backwards into the water,"" the spokeswoman told The Huffington Post in an email. ""Carnival’s CareTeam is providing support to the guest’s traveling companions and family. We are keeping our guest and her loved ones in our thoughts during this difficult time.""The woman's family told the Houston Chronicle she was a stay-at-home mother to four children in Arlington. Her husband told the New York Daily News he was not on the ship and was traveling home to be with family.Fellow passengers expressed shock and sadness upon hearing of Broberg's disappearance. The news spread with cruise employees searching the ship room by room. “Our steward came into our room, checked the closets, checked the bathroom, looked under the bed, looked out on our balcony. I mean, they did a very thorough search,” passenger Jo Trizila of Dallas told NBC. “We knew it wasn’t going to end well when the last few updates, the announcer said, ‘Would you please just keep this family in your thoughts and prayers.'”Search crews resumed efforts upon first light Sunday morning. They’ve combed more than 3,000 square miles of the Gulf since Friday.An investigation into how Broberg fell is ongoing, a Coast Guard spokesman told The Huffington Post Sunday.According to the website Cruise Junkie, which compiles information from news reports, 271 passengers and crew have fallen off a cruise ship or ferry since 1995.Carnival Cruise Lines holds the record for the most overboard passengers at 56, while Royal Caribbean International comes in second with 40.

Mind you, the audience had already witnessed Lee Daniels pay tribute to Carey's work as an ally, Connie Britton rock her magic hair and Caitlyn Jenner announce that she is ""in the house"" while onstage with Diane Sawyer. But Lawrence, who was there to honor Robert De Niro with the Excellence in Media Award, still found a way to charm the crowd. The Oscar winner delivered a touching and perfectly JLaw-esque speech to celebrate De Niro's decades-long advocacy for the LGBT community, while somehow managing not to trip, fall or stumble. After gushing about how pretty the audience looked (no, you're prettier, Jennifer), she opened her remarks with a line only Lawrence could pull off: ""Robert De Niro is not gay, so I don't know why we're here.""But she eventually got down to business, honoring his efforts to encourage acceptance of LGBT people within the entertainment industry. De Niro's father was gay and much of the actor's work within the community, like founding the Tribeca Film Festival to help amplify the voices of diverse filmmakers, is done to honor his father's legacy. In 2014, De Niro contributed to ""Remembering the Artist: Robert De Niro Sr.,"" an HBO documentary about his father, a painter who remained closeted for much of his life. ""As one of the greatest actors who's ever lived,"" Lawrence said, ""I can learn a lot from him, but the most important thing that he's taught all of us is acceptance. Bob is the kindest person I've ever met.""""His heart is so giving -- I don't know what to do if you clap,"" she riffed as the audience broke out in applause. ""Do I just keep going?""""All right. Everyone sit in stark silence,"" she continued. ""His heart is so giving and with his own quiet strength it's no wonder that this man, and the incredible organization that is GLAAD, would come together tonight.""Jennifer Lawrence wouldn't be JLaw if she didn't go a little off script, so immediately after her sincere remarks, she jokingly retracted her earlier statement about De Niro's heterosexuality. ""GLAAD and Bob have a lot in common. They're both gay,"" Lawrence deadpanned. ""Just kidding. I was told by five different people to cut that and I was like, 'Hell no.'""Watch her full introduction and De Niro's acceptance speech below. "

Though there are thousands of island destinations to choose from all over the world, there is one island that expert travelers do not want to share with you.",2016-05-15,2016-05-15-1463286462-8057743-FullSizeRender10.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-15-1463286462-8057743-FullSizeRender10-thumb.jpg,"There is something enticing about the idea of an island getaway. Though there are thousands of island destinations to choose from all over the world, there is one island that expert travelers do not want to share with you. Why? Because it is way too amazing to share! Sound intriguing? Well, lucky for you, I'm terrible at keeping secrets, and I'm about to spill the beans. As one of the over 7,000 islands that make up the Philippines, the island of Palawan is home to one special, unspoiled tiny town called El Nido.El Nido manages to be the most unattractive, and yet most beautiful, place all at once. It is a destination that can be both coarse and glamorous in the same moment thanks to its natural beauty and lack of amenities (such as fail-proof electricity). The lack of some creature comforts makes a great deal of tourists steer clear, but leaves the island free for real travelers and adventurers, like me, who seek this authenticity. Still, the journey to El Nido is far from easy. After traveling for nearly 24 hours, (two delayed flights and an 8 hour bus ride) I was dropped off where it was pitch dark, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. With almost no one around at 3am, I thought to myself ""What the hell did I get myself into this time?"" I also frantically wondered if there was a miscommunication with my bus driver and if he dropped me in some other neighboring town.As I pulled into town the next morning by tricycle (imagine a semi-homemade vehicle with three wheels attached to a motorbike), I still was in disbelief that I was in the right place. It was extremely overwhelming, as stores and restaurants were unrecognizable from one another, and every business was seemingly a shack with a sign. However, as time went on and I became visually adjusted, the shops looked more like shops and the restaurants more like restaurants, and everything began to distinguish itself from one another. I met the wonderful people that worked in these places, and in each place the workers and owners were generous and eager to please. El Nido is different from other places in the Philippines such as Boracay, thanks to the people that live there. Unlike most tourist destinations where the people conducting business are looking to rip off thousands of tourists, everyone in El Nido is incredibly honest and just so happy to have you there in their small town. For example, on my last day in El Nido I had planned an island hopping tour and our boat broke down mid-way, so instead of island hopping we went island limping. We were able to slowly make it to a few nearby islands, but not all of the ones on our list. Though the owner still had to pay the boat captain and crew for their time and for the meals prepared, he still gave me a full refund saying it was the least that he could do, despite that we were out on the boat for the full day. Or take Palawan Divers, the dive shop that was extremely accommodating and arranged for me to have a one-on-one with a dive master after I blew all 3 of my dives due to nerves on day one. The people of El Nido work incredibly hard and will do just about anything to ensure that your stay is memorable. Additionally, El Nido does not have people trying to hustle travelers, and almost no one tries to sell you things on the beach or scam you out of money in this town. The people of El Nido are among the most kind, generous and welcoming people that I have ever met.I have had many favorite places over the years during my world travels, but I have never traveled to a place quite as lovely as El Nido. In El Nido, my days were spent island hopping (my favorite island hopping experience was with the company Hello El Nido), snorkeling, and SCUBA diving, and my evenings were spent watching the most sensational sunsets that I have ever seen at Republica, a beachside sunset bar in a nearby town. I was making new friends from all over the world at every turn. Not all destinations lend themselves to be as welcoming to solo travelers as El Nido, which is probably why there were so many of us.No one wants to tell you about El Nido because adventurous travelers love El Nido just the way it is, flaws and all, and don't want it to become overrun by tourists like you. El Nido is a traveler's heaven, currently lacking the obnoxious and change-demanding tourists that destroy beautiful destinations. Unfortunately, over the next decade, El Nido certainly has the potential to become the next Phuket or Cancun where travelers flock by the thousands to get tan and drink for cheap. That's a scary thought for real travelers who seek destinations with unique character and quirks.If you love the all-inclusive resort Atlantis type resorts that I personally find to be a living hell, then El Nido is not the place for you. El Nido is difficult. It is difficult to get to and difficult to exist in if you aren't low maintenance. Roads are made of dirt and there aren't a whole heck of a lot of ways to get around. The access to wi-fi is awful, there is basically no ATM, transportation is unreliable, and power outages (including your air conditioning when it's over 100 degrees) happen multiple times a day. For me this is part of the charm and part of the fun. When the wi-fi is touch & go, or there is a blackout, it forces you to disconnect and enjoy the people around you. The sunsets are remarkable, but they are much more beautiful when you enjoy them with new friends from all over the world while sharing stories of the incredible creatures you all saw on your dives. When you share your bar food with someone who is running out of money because they decided to stay longer and there is no money in the one and only ATM in town, that adds to the adventure. These are the experiences that make a destination memorable and enjoyable, not how many whiskey buckets you drank at your all-inclusive resort, or how many times you ordered room service. On my final morning, I packed up my suitcase, said goodbye to my new friends and staff at my little hotel, and hopped in my shuttle back to Puerto Princesa. Over the next 5 hours as we zoomed past motorbikes overfilled with passengers, ox drawn carts, trikes carrying giant pigs, and kids playing in the streets, I couldn't help but have a heartache for how much I would miss the simplicity of the lifestyle and warmth of the people in Palawan. If you decide to visit El Nido, my suggestion is run, don't walk. Thanks to the beauty of the islands, it's only a matter of time until this special place is overrun with every tourist on the planet.Quick Tips for Travel to El Nido:Getting there: From Puerto Princesa, take a shuttle instead of the bus--it's faster and more reliable, as the bus does not run on time and stops for anyone standing on the street. It is not direct.  From Manila, book early and spend a little more money to skip the long bus ride to instead fly in and out of El Nido. Money: Bring as much cash (Philippine Pesos) as you will need for the length of your stay. The first ATM was installed at the end of 2015 and is only filled once a week. It generally runs out of money within a day. Health: There is a small amount of malaria on the island, so consult with your physician to see if you should bring anti-malaria meds with you. Additionally, the nearest hospital is 6 hours away in Puerto Princesa and the nearest decompression chamber (for scuba divers) is on another island in Coron, so plan accordingly if you have health conditions.Also on HuffPost:"

Everything should have a price, especially education--which is worthless.""Delivered with cold fury by actress Portia di Rossi, the words are like a chisel chopping into a block of ice.If that attitude doesn't perfectly sum up the kind of cruel Alice in Wonderland BS you hear from Republican state legislators and even members of Congress, what does?Lev Raphael is the author of The Vampyre of Gotham and 24 other books in genres from mystery to memoir that you can find on Amazon."

Not to worry though, your interviews can still be entertaining.",2016-05-15,2016-05-15-1463272431-8832889-joel_pei_effect6.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-15-1463272431-8832889-joel_pei_effect6-thumb.jpg,"How to Remind Your Guest to Send Over Their Info Give your guests a gentle reminder of by when they need to send you their info for the show, including - social media links, a headshot, a 50-75 word bio/intro, and titles of their book(s) or programs.Good language to use in the email: ""So we can keep you on schedule, please shoot over..."" or ""So I don't miss anything, what's the best way to bring you in the conversation?""Don't do what I did early on, and catch yourself grasping for straws at the last minute. Generally, I request info at least 48 hours before the show.If they're not able to, we generally take them off the schedule temporarily. (If you don't respect your own time, you can't expect others to either.)Need a little help emailing and inviting on high profile, A-list guests? Try these two emails. Before You Push ""Record"" Do These Two Things With Your Guest Depending on your show's focus, many of your guests may not have the ""chops"" that seasoned speakers and media pros have for being interviewed.Not to worry though, your interviews can still be entertaining (that needs to come first), enlightening, and educational. All it takes is some guest prep on your side. Remember, the guest, experienced or not, will typically look to you for guidance. Make sure you set them up for success, by being a great guide.1. Before the show starts, remind your interviewee not to tell their whole story in the first two minutes. Believe me, it is way tough to recover from that, when they do.2. Give your guest a frame of reference for where to start. Be sure to let them know this ahead of time. This gives you flexibility and a place to go with the conversation.EX: ""When you got out of high school..."" ""Right before your accident..."" ""The day before you quit your job...""Unfortunately, many interviewers forget to do this. Instead, they ask broad, open-ended questions, that are hard to answer and aren't relevant to the show or audience. Ex: ""Can you share with our listeners a little about yourself?"" or ""Can you give us a little background on how you got to where you are today?"" These types of questions lack focus, direction and can make for a rough start to the conversation.Don't assume your guest knows the best place to begin their story. Walk them to it.Your audience and guests will thank you.The Best Way to Handle your Guest Introductions We've all heard shows where the host would read out a 1-3 paragraph intro before bringing the guest into the show. And, while it's usually done out of respect for the guest, to give him or her kudos for their accomplishments and to set them up for a killer interview, it's not necessarily the best use of the guest or listener's time, and from a radio veteran's perspective, it's not good radio.Don't tell us about the guest's three best-selling books, or about how they overcame failure, an injury, or a business collapse. instead, get into the conversation and have them tell us.Don't script out and read a long and detailed intro for your guest. Involve them in their own intro. My intros are 1-3 sentences max.Here's a quick course to brush up on your interviewing skills - 5 Steps to a Fantastic Interview.It takes the right mix of art and science to pull off a great interview and show.

The invasion will come through new cruise line stops, new commercial flights from the US, and the general increased interest of Americans as relationships between the two nations begin to improve.Some of the key challenges include: preserving ecosystems, coastal habitats, and marine environments, clean marinas and sustainable ports, need for rapid development of new infrastructure, need for sustainable food supplies to meet increased demand, development of sustainable tourism and coastal sustainability master plans and management strategies. Perhaps one of the most important challenges is finding ways to involve the people of Cuba in the solutions to these challenges in such a way that they will also share in the benefits.Our first meeting was with Fernando Bretos, Executive Director of Cubamar, a program of the Ocean Foundation. Cubamar has been promoting exchanges related to marine science for a couple of decades in areas such as coral reefs, coastal habitat, and sea turtles. From this meeting we are pleased to report that the Patel College of Global Sustainability and Cubamar plan to sponsor a turtle from Cuba in this years Tour de Turtle race. Our turtle will be racing for the cause of Sustainable Tourism.Fernando stated: ""CubaMar, a Project of The Ocean Foundation, looks forward to this new collaboration with USF and our Cuban partners with home we have been collaborating since 1998. Cuba is facing major changes, particularly in terms of impacts from tourism. Cruise traffic, coastal development and overfishing present challenges that will require strong collaboration and creativity. Cuba is our last chance in the Caribbean to do things right and avoid the fate of many other destinations such as Cancun. USF brings a formidable team with experience working around the world on sustainable tourism development.""We also met with Commodore Diaz Escrich of the Hemingway Yacht Club. We discussed the challenges of the infrastructure not in place to handle the large number of tourists who will soon be arriving in ports and marinas from both cruise ships and private yachts. We discussed possible solutions such as the Florida and NOAA Clean Marina initiatives, port sustainability strategies developed by the USF College of Marine Science (CMS), and pump out stations that would go to biodigester that could convert both sewage and food waste to biogas energy.A biodigester can easily converts 5000 tons of waste into 3000 CF/Ton or of biogas which can used or 100 KW of of electrical energy. Converting the food and sewage waste in the harbor could provide for all the harbor energy needs with additional energy available for the city of Havana.We then met with Dr. Patricia Gonzalez where we discussed possible collaboration for enhancing and protecting coastal habitat and marine environments through the Blue Community strategies, ocean policy models developed by the USF CMS, and joint education programs that share and teach best practices.Finally, we met with a University of Havana tourism faculty expert who expressed an interest in the expertise PCGS offers in both coastal sustainability and sustainable tourism that he stated were both so closely integrated. Discussions included the need to better manage coastal habitat, including fishery management and the development of new fishery initiatives, such as our partners at the Anna Maria Fish Co. & Healthy Earth have begun in Florida. Dr. Salinas stated that two key challenges from his perspective are to develop funding mechanisms to rapidly improve and build needed infrastructure, and to develop business models that will provide the people of Cuba both a living wage and the opportunity to occasionally enjoy the Cuba tourism resources that they provide for others.Building new infrastructure, if done sustainably, will go a long way toward providing the economy development that will allow Cubans to participate in this new resource development.Cuba does have many challenges and it also has many gifts that other tourism destinations around the world might do well to examine. Some of the key gifts that we observed include deliberate policy promoting sustainable tourism, cleanliness, pedestrian friendly, local food emphasis, people who are interested in and working to protect and conserve natural resources, and friendly people to welcome guests.In 1997, following tourism development that seemed to pay little attention to environmental or cultural impacts, the Cuban government specifically defined sustainable tourism in a new law (Ley 81). In a recent update on the ""Current State of Sustainable Tourism in Cuba"", Swen Waterers reports, ""According to this law (also known as Ley del Medio Ambiente de la República de Cuba), the focus is on mitigating negative impacts through strict regulations regarding power usage and import of produce, and focusing on ecotourism as a way to leverage from its rich natural heritage consisting of six UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, six Ramsar sites and nine World Heritage Sites.""We were impressed that a city of over 2 million people seemed to have relatively clean streets. We also noticed that there were no fast food restaurants to be seen. While Cuba may have better street cleaning services than other places in the world, we couldn't help put wonder how much the lack of fast food restaurants was contributing to less pollution, as well.The orientation toward pedestrians was impressive. For example, The Malecon is a five mile (8 KM) sea walk that stretches form the Havana Harbor to Old Havana. The Malecón continues to be popular among Cubans, especially among those of lesser means whose other means of entertainment are limited. It is also a place where new private businesses are springing up and a place where poorer families can create small street businesses and individual fishermen can cast their lures.Old Havana is a UNESCO world heritage site and the 2 square mile areas is accessed primarily by walking.  The lack of fast food also means that people are more likely to experience local food. Cuban agriculture accounts for less than 10% of the GDP, but employs 20% of the nations workforce and utilizes about 30% of the countries land. Urban farming is also promoted. In Havana for example 90% of the city's produce comes from local urban farms and gardens.These are all strengths that if kept intact and protected will draw tourists to the unique Caribbean experience unlike many other tourist destinations. There is much for other destinations to learn from the way Havana has developed. We now hope to move forward with new sharing, collaboration, and co-creation for sustainable tourism. We hope you may wish to join us in this effort.As Richard Berman, director of the USF Patel College of Global Sustainability said, ""We share a great opportunity using sustainability as a common goal to share our experience, research, and interest with their culture research and history at a crucial time in their country's civil society. We look forward to a long term, active partnership of exchange, research, and collaborative projects!""We look forward to our next visit to Cuba where I hope to share some best practices from our own local areas as well as around the world.

They're those things that seem to hold us back from charging our worth, feeling like we're enough and unapologetically announcing to the world who we are. It keeps us from attracting clients who easily say, ""Yes!"" and it keeps us from making the kind of money we want to impact the world and live freely in our daily lives.So how can you create a mindset that makes you indestructible? Here are 5 Elements to a Winning Mindset:  1. Do not deny your intuition a role in your life.Your intuition serves you more than you know. Sometimes the best decisions are made intuitively rather than logically. Does your price feel good to you? Does working with a particular client feel good to you? Does saying, ""No"" to a given situation feel good to you? You don't need any more justification than that when you're creating your life by your rules.2. Invite The Universe in on the actionWhen we worry about all the how's for getting from point A to point B, we limit the ways in which The Universe can help us out. On the other hand, when we do our part, taking inspired action, and let The Universe in on the party, we allow for chance happening, magical moments and accidental meetings. The Universe knows ALL the people in the world. Don't you think that he can bring you all the clients you could ever wish for?  3. Be careful who you allow to talk in your earLetting others affect our vibe is a sure-fire way to lose momentum. I've been there and I'm sure you've been there too. Whether it's mom, dad, sibling, friend or even foe, making sure you surround yourself with the right people really matters! Get a mastermind partner if you don't have one and make sure you limit your exposure to naysayer and other people who don't understand or support your vision.4. Convince your mind with positive repetitionYour mind doesn't know fact from fiction. So when you repeatedly tell it something, it becomes more and more ingrained. That's why if you have an old story you want to let go of or something someone said that you don't want to keep believing, it's best not to repeat it out loud or inside your head. Say your mantras and manifestations, along with visualizing with feeling right before bed. Then your subconscious mind can get a hold of it and make it a reality.5. Don't let overwhelm be an optionAs entrepreneurs, it's easy to create project after project and task after task until you're burning the midnight oil for days on end. While taking inspired action is good, going on overdrive and overwhelm is not. When you start to feel that anxiety level increase, take a step back, take a soak in the tub, promise to get to bed early that night (or a few in a row) and let the craziness die down. Overwhelm is never an option for success."
33,EDUCATION,Honoring Our Past and Inspiring Our Future,"Randi Weingarten, ContributorPresident, American Federation of Teachers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/honoring-our-past-and-ins_b_9976430.html,"The American Federation of Teachers reached a significant milestone this week: the centennial of our founding.

As I've pored over historical documents from our archives, it's clear that, from generation to generation, our union has been a vehicle to fight for positive change both in public schools and in society. As we enter our second century, we remain fiercely committed to creating educational opportunity, building professional voice and agency, and advancing economic, racial and social justice for all. The seeds of teacher unionism were sown in the late 19th century, with teachers like Henrietta Rodman, who helped found a teachers union in New York City and led the fight to allow women teachers to keep their jobs when they married or had children. In Chicago, Margaret Haley worked through her local union to challenge pervasive poverty, teachers' lack of resources and low pay, and a curriculum imposed by bureaucrats. Recognizing the strength they would have as affiliates of a national union in a larger labor movement, in 1916 both women's unions joined with five other local unions to form the American Federation of Teachers. Then, as now, working people had many reasons to be angry. The AFT has worked to channel the aspirations underlying that anger into positive action. From the start, our leaders have known that power is necessary to bring about change, and that working people build power through their collective action at the ballot box and the bargaining table and through their skills, knowledge and ideas. For 100 years, the AFT has worked to build power and use it for good. In the 1920s, the AFT lobbied Congress for children's rights, improved teacher salaries and programs to combat adult illiteracy. We have continued that work. For example, in 2015, as Congress worked to reauthorize the primary federal education law, AFT members took more than 120,000 online actions and met face to face with legislators to help shape the law so it could have the potential to give educators the voice and resources they need to give children the education they deserve.The AFT has grown to include other school employees, professors, government workers, nurses and healthcare professionals, and early childhood educators. While the AFT and the larger labor movement grew, so did America's middle-class and working families' standard of living. The labor movement helped ensure that working people, not simply special interests, had power in our democracy. Collective bargaining provided AFT affiliates leverage to advocate for quality, agency and voice on the job--the embodiment of our motto: ""A union of professionals."" The AFT has also used collective action to advance racial and social justice. As early as 1918, the AFT demanded equal pay for African-American teachers and lobbied for equal educational opportunities for African-American children. In 1953, the AFT filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs in the Brown v. Board of Education case before the Supreme Court, the only educational organization and union to do so. Hundreds of AFT members traveled south in the 1960s to register new African-American voters and teach in AFT-run Freedom Schools. Today, the AFT is working to attract and retain teachers of color and to promote racial equity in education, the economy and criminal justice. And we stand up against bigotry in all its forms. The AFT's greatest strength has always been our members, professionals whose skills, knowledge and ideas both strengthen, and are strengthened by, their union. The AFT's Share My Lesson is the fastest-growing free digital collection of resources for educators. The AFT Innovation Fund cultivates promising union-led ideas to strengthen public education. Our student debt clinics have helped members sharply reduce crushing college debt. And AFT members--from registered nurses and adjunct professors to paraprofessionals and parole officers--practice solution-driven unionism, using our expertise to improve the quality of our work. You don't hit 100 without some setbacks. Austerity has caused harmful cuts to public education and services throughout our history. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and other governors intent on destroying any curb on their power have waged war on public sector unions. Many elected officials have sought to destabilize public schools and services in order to promote flawed privatization schemes.It's all the more reason to honor the example of the AFT's founding mothers and fathers, to take our anger, build on our aspirations, and channel them into action--for our cause, our country and our members, and for those we serve and those who will follow. From one generation to the next, we are honoring our past and inspiring our future. Weingarten, right, with Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers (AFT Local 2), and Karen Lewis, president of the Chicago Teachers Union (AFT Local 1)."
34,WORLDPOST,Is al-Qaeda Poised to Declare Its First Emirate in the Middle East?,"Joseph V. Micallef, ContributorBest Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Key...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-al-qaeda-poised-to-dec_b_9976450.html,"On May 7, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the head of al-Qaeda, released an audio recording in which he announced that he had given his permission for the al-Qaeda affiliated Syrian jihadist group, al-Nusra Front, to create ""a new emirate"" in Syria.",2016-05-15,2016-05-15-1463281890-8974794-EmirateZawahiriandBaghdadi.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-15-1463281890-8974794-EmirateZawahiriandBaghdadi-thumb.png," Ayman al-Zawahiri (left) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (right)On May 7, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the head of al-Qaeda, released an audio recording in which he announced that he had given his permission for the al-Qaeda affiliated Syrian jihadist group, al-Nusra Front, to create ""a new emirate"" in Syria. Currently, al-Nusra Front has militants scattered throughout western Syria and directly controls a region of approximately 2,000 square miles in Idlib Province. This was not the first al-Qaeda linked emirate. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had declared an emirate in Yemen back in 2012. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) announced the creation of the ""Sahara Emirate"" in 2010, although technically the emirate was created by a splinter group from al-Qaeda that later rejoined AQIM. The proposed ""Syrian Emirate"" is, however, the first emirate in which al-Qaeda's senior leadership has taken the lead in organizing. As such, it represents a direct challenge to the Islamic State (IS) Caliphate announced by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in June 2014, further underscoring the increasingly bitter and oftentimes violent rivalry between the two organizations.In the Islamic world an emirate is a political organization and the emir who governs it is a political leader. A caliphate is both a political and religious organization, and the caliph who governs it is simultaneously both a political and a religious leader. The caliph represents the highest political and religious authority within the Islamic world. Typically, in Islamic history, emirates have been subdivisions within a caliphate and emirs local leaders subordinate to the caliph.Under Sharia law there can only be one caliphate and only one Amir al-Mu'minin--leader of the faithful. The last official caliphate ended in 1922 with the abolishment of the Ottoman Sultanate. The leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared the establishment of a new caliphate in June 2014, assuming for himself the title of caliph and ""leader of the faithful.""Zawahiri's announcement stopped short of calling for the establishment of a rival caliphate. He did, however, lay the foundation for declaring a caliphate at a later date by characterizing the Islamic State as ""Kharijites."" The term is used by Salafists who agree with Islamic States' religious doctrines but disagree with the organization's political views and agenda.  AL-Nusra Front fighters in SyriaThe Kharijites were a radical sect in the early history of Islam that was noted for its extremist views on takfir, the excommunication and killing of Muslims considered insufficiently devout or accused of having abandoned Islam. The term Kharijite or neo-Kharijite is often used as a synonym for extremist Islamic views.The announcement, although not wholly unprecedented, capped a sharp change from previous al-Qaeda policy, and has been in process since at least 2012. Bin-Laden had always opposed the creation of either an emirate or a caliphate in the Middle East until the United States was ""defeated,"" in other words, until it either voluntarily withdrew from the Middle East, or was forcibly ejected, and its protection of the Western leaning Gulf monarchies was ended. Bin Laden believed that the announcement of an emirate or caliphate prior to ""defeating"" America would result in the United States and its allies bringing overwhelming force against the new state and destroying it. There are at least three reasons that explain the shift in strategy on the part of al-Qaeda and Zawahiri over the last several years.First, it is clear that Islamic State has garnered a lot of prestige and influence in the jihadist world by proclaiming itself a caliphate. Since June 2014, IS has drawn over three dozen jihadist movements into its orbit and it has expanded its ""geographic reach"" to include 30 different provinces or wilayas. In some cases, like the three Libyan wilayas (Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan), Islamic State is heavily involved from an operational standpoint and has supplied fighters, arms and financial assistance. Others, like the Nigerian Boko Haram or the Philippine Abu Sayyaf, have adopted some of the imagery and sophisticated media techniques of Islamic State, but do not maintain any direct operational links with IS nor does it appear that they are subject to Baghdadi's direct control. Of the 30 different wilayas organized by Islamic State, 20 are in Syria and Iraq, and 10 are outside of its core territory. Not all of the wilayas in Iraq and Syria, however, are under its control. Some like the wilaya of Baghdad or Damascus, it has proclaimed but never actually governed. Moreover, outside of the city of Sirte in Libya, all the cities it controls are in its core Syrian-Iraqi territory.Many of Islamic State's affiliates and provinces outside of its core territory are simply existing jihadist organizations, or splinters of those organizations, that have attempted to leverage Islamic State's prestige by rebranding themselves as affiliates. The Wilaya al Sudan al Gharbi (West Africa Province) is simply a repackaged Boko Haram. The Wilaya Sinai was the Sinai branch of the Egyptian jihadist group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem) that broke away from the pro al-Qaeda parent organization and declared its allegiance to IS. By declaring its own official ""emirate"", al-Qaeda is leveling the playing field and trying to win back for itself some of the legitimacy and jihadist credentials that Islamic State obtained by declaring itself a caliphate.Disposition of forces in the Syrian civil war as of May 1, 2016Secondly, it is also possible that al-Qaeda is anticipating the imminent destruction, or the severe curtailment, of Islamic State and is positioning itself to inherit the remains of IS. Many of the Islamic State's foreign affiliates are either splinter groups, which emerged from existing pro al-Qaeda organizations, or former al-Qaeda affiliates that turned away to join IS. By positioning itself to absorb any remnants of Islamic State, al-Qaeda is creating the means for reintegrating those pro-IS splinter groups back into their pro-al-Qaeda parent.It's not entirely clear why Zawahiri chose al-Nusra Front as the vehicle for al-Qaeda's first official emirate. The al-Nusra Front leadership is openly loyal to Zawahiri. It shows far less independence, and historically has been more willing to follow Zawahiri's lead, than the powerful al-Qaeda affiliates like the North African based al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) or the South Arabian based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). It may also reflect the fact that al-Nusra Front's close proximity to IS means it is more likely to inherit, or be able to seize control, of major urban centers currently controlled by Islamic State militants. Finally, Zawahiri's announcement also probably signifies a reassessment of the threat that the US and its allies pose to the new emirate. Given how anemic the US response has been to the emergence of Islamic State, Zawahiri may have concluded that Bin Laden was mistaken in arguing that the US must first be ""defeated"" before an emirate or a caliphate could be established. He may now feel it is safe to declare al-Qaeda's first official emirate in the heart of the historic Middle East, even if the US continues to remain engaged in Middle Eastern affairs. Will an official al-Qaeda caliphate be far behind?Regardless of the combination of reasons that may have prompted Zawahiri to approve the creation of an official al-Qaeda sponsored emirate, the emergence of two competing state organizations in close proximity to each other in the historic center of the Middle East further underscores the rivalry between al-Qaeda and Islamic State for the leadership of the international jihadist movement. This rivalry will only add to the rising violence in the Islamic world, further stoke the sectarianism that characterizes it and further polarize Middle East politics."

Currently, al-Nusra Front has militants scattered throughout western Syria and directly controls a region of approximately 2,000 square miles in Idlib Province. This was not the first al-Qaeda linked emirate. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had declared an emirate in Yemen back in 2012. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) announced the creation of the ""Sahara Emirate"" in 2010, although technically the emirate was created by a splinter group from al-Qaeda that later rejoined AQIM. The proposed ""Syrian Emirate"" is, however, the first emirate in which al-Qaeda's senior leadership has taken the lead in organizing. As such, it represents a direct challenge to the Islamic State (IS) Caliphate announced by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in June 2014, further underscoring the increasingly bitter and oftentimes violent rivalry between the two organizations.In the Islamic world an emirate is a political organization and the emir who governs it is a political leader. A caliphate is both a political and religious organization, and the caliph who governs it is simultaneously both a political and a religious leader. The caliph represents the highest political and religious authority within the Islamic world. Typically, in Islamic history, emirates have been subdivisions within a caliphate and emirs local leaders subordinate to the caliph.Under Sharia law there can only be one caliphate and only one Amir al-Mu'minin--leader of the faithful. The last official caliphate ended in 1922 with the abolishment of the Ottoman Sultanate. The leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared the establishment of a new caliphate in June 2014, assuming for himself the title of caliph and ""leader of the faithful.""Zawahiri's announcement stopped short of calling for the establishment of a rival caliphate. He did, however, lay the foundation for declaring a caliphate at a later date by characterizing the Islamic State as ""Kharijites."" The term is used by Salafists who agree with Islamic States' religious doctrines but disagree with the organization's political views and agenda.  AL-Nusra Front fighters in SyriaThe Kharijites were a radical sect in the early history of Islam that was noted for its extremist views on takfir, the excommunication and killing of Muslims considered insufficiently devout or accused of having abandoned Islam. The term Kharijite or neo-Kharijite is often used as a synonym for extremist Islamic views.The announcement, although not wholly unprecedented, capped a sharp change from previous al-Qaeda policy, and has been in process since at least 2012.

Officially it was called the Asia Minor Agreement, but it has gone down in history as the namesake of its two principal negotiators--Mark Sykes and Francois Georges Picot . The agreement marked the beginning of the imposition of European dominance over the Middle East, which would last for roughly half a century. It was the first exercise of European control since the First Crusade at the end of the eleventh century. This time, however, it covered virtually the entire Middle East, not just the thin strip of land from Edessa to Gaza that had hosted the Christian Kingdoms from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries.The genesis of Sykes-Picot was varied. When the Ottoman Empire formally entered World War I as an ally of the Central Powers on November 3, 1914, Russia had been quick to demand British and French approval for substantial concessions from the Ottomans in the event they were defeated. Russia demanded ""the city of Constantinople, the western shore of the Bosporus, Sea of Marmara and Dardanelles, as well as southern Thrace up to the Enos-Midia line,"" as well as ""a part of the Asiatic coast between the Bosporus, the Sakarya River, and a point to be determined on the shore of the Bay of Izmit."" Russia even demanded control of Mosul and the oil fields surrounding it.  Original division of Ottoman lands between Great Britain and France set out in the Sykes-Picot AgreementThe Ottoman entry into the war came at a time when the Allies were reeling on the Western Front. The German advance into France had been checked only a few weeks before at the First Battle of the Marne, (Sept 5-12, 1914). Both sides were now engaged in the ""race to the sea,"" as each army tried to outflank the other. In the process, as each side dug in, they created the system of trenches that would define combat on the Western Front for the next four years. Great Britain and France readily agreed to the Russian demands, save for the one for Mosul and its oil fields. That concession was reserved for later discussion. At the time, neither Great Britain nor France could spare any troops for the new front, so engaging the Ottoman Army was seen as mostly a task for the Russian Army.Sykes-Picot was motivated by the British and French desire to both block any further expansion southward by Russia, as well as an attempt to grab a chunk of the Ottoman Empire for themselves, especially the oil rich regions around Basra and Mosul. At this point oil had been discovered in Persia (Iran) and Mesopotamia (Iraq) and along the Caspian. The discovery of oil in the Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula would not happen until the 1930's. The original agreement called for Mosul to be incorporated into the French zone, which would later be organized into Syria, and for Basra to be incorporated into the British zone. It would later be included in the League of Nations mandate for the newly organized state of Iraq. The final boundaries would be revised multiple times by subsequent treaties. The Versailles Peace Conference (1919), the Treaty of Sevres (1920), its subsequent revision in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), the San Remo Conference (1920), as well as various League of Nations mandates, all changed the original division laid out in the Sykes-Picot Agreement. Mosul for example, originally intended to be part of the French zone, was incorporated into the British Mandate of Iraq. In turn, London organized the North Iraqi Oil Company to exploit the Mosul oil fields and gave France a quarter stake in the company. The Golan Heights were originally part of the British Mandate for Palestine, but were traded to France in return for the region of Metula, in what is now northeastern Israel.  Competing claims for territory of the former Ottoman EmpireThere were a variety of other side agreements as well, many of which would ultimately prove to be incompatible. These included, famously, the Hussein-McMahon correspondence, which assured that the Hashemite family would rule most of the region in return for their support in organizing and leading the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. This was the revolt that propelled an obscure British Lieutenant named T.E. Lawrence to fame as Lawrence of Arabia. It also included the Balfour Declaration that declared, ""his Majesty's government view(ed) with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people."" That declaration was subsequently incorporated into the Treaty of Sevres and into the agreement governing the British Mandate of Palestine.Italy, Greece and Armenia had all been promised substantial territories in Asia Minor in return for their participation in the war on the Allied side. Armenia, for example, would have received additional territory westward as far as Lake Van, a area also promised to Russia. Italy had been promised various Aegean islands, some of which were claimed by Greece, as well as control of the western and south central coasts of Anatolia around the city of Antalya. Greece had been promised Smyrna and the region surrounding it--the city hosted a large Greek population. It had also been promised control of Constantinople and all of Thrace, both of which had also been claimed by Russia. Most of these concessions were subsequently cancelled by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. At Versailles, President Woodrow Wilson advocated for the creation of a Kurdish state, but this also was dropped in subsequent negotiations. So, too, were promises to the region's Assyrian Christian population for their own independent nation. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, Russia's new Bolshevik government demanded that Great Britain and France honor the concessions that had been made to Russia back in November 1914. The Allies refused, arguing that the Bolsheviks had forfeited those concessions when they had signed a separate peace with the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk on March 3, 1918. In retaliation Lenin ordered Pravda to print the text of the Russian copy of the Sykes-Picot Agreement in the Tsarist archives. That's how the world first heard of the hitherto secret agreement.  Prince Feisal and the Arab delegation at the Versailles Peace Conference. T. E. Lawrence is on his immediate right.It would be incorrect to say that the current constellation of nations in the Middle East, or their national frontiers, was solely the result of the Sykes-Picot Agreement. The agreement, however, did represent the beginning of the direct assertion of European control over the Middle East and its division into national entities whose borders did not correspond to prevailing cultural, ethnic or religious divides. In that sense the modern Middle East, and all of the conflicts created by the superimposition of those ethnic, religious and cultural schisms on the current patchwork of national boundaries, is the direct and still enduring legacy of Sykes-Picot. What began as a grab for oil in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire has reverberated over the decades since, and a century later is still shaping the dynamic of contemporary Middle East politics."

Stock Photo. Pixabay.comA lot of leaders in the West are appalled that Donald Trump, whom they see as a demagogue, bully and know-nothing, has a shot at becoming president of the United States.Many countries in the former Soviet Union are pulling for the presumptive Republican candidate, however.Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised him as a ""brilliant and talented person.""Putin likes him partly because Trump has said that he would get along with the Russian president and ""with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with.""""He says he wants to move on to a new, more substantial relationship, a deeper relationship with Russia,"" Putin enthused. ""How can we not welcome that?""I'm convinced that other dictators in the former Soviet Union, many of whom chafe over the American government's attacks on their corruption, nepotism and human-rights violations, feel the same way as Putin, though they aren't expressing it publicly, as he does.From my point of view, it's not just Trump's willingness to work with Putin and other dictators in the former Soviet Union that has led to a lot of support for him in the region.It's also that they identify with him. Many of these leaders are racists, homophobes, bullies and thugs -- like Trump.They feel Trump is a member of their club, a kindred spirit, someone they can understand. And someone who understands them and will turn a blind eye to their mischief.Much of the world has been offended by Trump's comments that Mexican immigrants to the United States are rapists and that he would ban all Muslim immigrants because of the possibility that some could be terrorists. (He recently backed off the Muslims comment in an attempt to portray himself as more cuddly to American voters.)Putin understands Trump's penchant for demonizing those who are not like him.He was the one who demanded that the Russian parliament pass anti-gay legislation in 2013 that drew howls internationally and prompted President Barack Obama to boycott the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014.Other countries in the former Soviet Union have drafted the same legislation, indicating that their leaders feel the same way Putin does about those who don't have a ""traditional sexual orientation.""Some leaders in the former Soviet Union love to bully others, so Trump's penchant for bullying is just fine with them.Because he has yet to become a political leader, Trump hasn't used a government office to intimidate others.But his bent toward bullying is clearly there -- and leaders in the former Soviet Union are well aware of it.Take, for example, Trump's comments that ""torture works,"" so he would allow it if he were president, and that he would like to punch protesters ""in the face.""I'm sure the torture comments sit well with dictators like Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan, which Human Rights Watch has condemned for its widespread use of torture and killing.Meanwhile, Trump's comment about punching others in the face has to warm the cockles of Putin, who has invaded weaker neighbors Ukraine and Georgia and uses the threat of cutting off Russia's oil and gas to intimidate other neighbors into doing his bidding.Although Putin uses his military to punch neighbors in the face figuratively, other leaders in the former Soviet Union literally punch others in the face, or have others do it for them.The thousands of confidential diplomatic cables that Wikileaks has made public include several American diplomats' accounts of Armenian leaders beating up others over personal grudges -- or having goons in their entourages do the beating.In 2001, for example, a cable noted that President Robert Kocharian's bodyguard Aghamal Harutiunyan beat a nightclub patron to death.The patron's offense? Greeting the president with ""Hello, Rob"" in a restroom.Apparently Kocharian considered Poghos Poghosian's familiarity an insult, and his bodyguard took over from there.Harutiunyan's punishment for the murder was probation, which meant he essentially got off Scot-free.Although human-rights groups called for Kocharian to be indicted in the murder as well, there was no way Armenian prosecutors would have done that.Another American cable dealt with Armenian Governor Suren Khachatryan viciously beating a teenager who had stopped one of the governor's sons from sexually harassing a girl. Nothing happened to the governor, of course.Nor did anything happen to a nephew of current Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan, who started a nightclub fight in the capital of Yerevan that led to a patron losing an eye.Trump's remark about punching a protester in the face indicates that he would have no problem with the thuggery that some Armenian leaders have engaged in.Given that many leaders in the former Soviet Union are racists, homophobes, bullies and thugs, it's no wonder they like Trump. As president of the United States, he would likely receive a hero's welcome in their capitals.Armine Sahakyan is a human rights activist based in Armenia.
