But every now and then, he’ll turn on ESPN and notice an on-screen alert: A pitcher is just a few outs away from a perfect game. Almost inevitably, he will tune in.June 20 was one of those days. Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer was one out away from perfection, the same place that Wilcox, who pitched 16 seasons in the majors, had once been three decades ago. Scherzer let loose a two-strike slider that started at Pittsburgh Pirates pinch-hitter Jose Tabata’s hands. It was supposed to snap back across the inside corner of home plate, but it spun and hung just slightly. Instead of falling into catcher Wilson Ramos’ glove, it glanced off Tabata’s elbow.Scherzer, off to the side of the mound, tossed his head back in disbelief. Twenty-six hitters, 26 outs. The 27th jogged past him on his way to first. Max Scherzer hits Jose Tabata with two outs in the ninth inning, spoiling a perfect game. A perfect game -- 27 hitters up, 27 down, none of them reaching first base safely -- is one of the sport’s rarest feats. There have been just 21 in Major League Baseball’s modern era, an average of one every five years since Cy Young threw the first of them in 1904. They require a dialed-in pitcher, stellar (and at times spectacular) defense and a little luck. They are an arbitrary occurrence, a feat accomplished by baseball royalty -- Young, Randy Johnson and Sandy Koufax, three of the best pitchers to ever hold a ball, have thrown them -- and baseball afterthoughts -- Phil Humber, Len Barker and Charlie Robertson all ended their careers with perfect games and losing records.By hitting Tabata, Scherzer earned his membership into an even more exclusive club. For just the 13th time in Major League history (though, oddly, the fourth time since 2010), a pitcher lost a perfect game with two outs in the ninth inning.Milt Wilcox is one of them. And if his recollection of the night he nearly wrote his name into baseball's record books is any indication, Scherzer won’t soon forget the moment when he fell just shy of perfection.Wilcox took the mound on April 15, 1983, for his second start of the year for the Detroit Tigers, and right away, something felt different.“I knew what I’d throw and what it would do, what would happen,” Wilcox said. “Everything was rolling.”He retired 26 straight Chicago White Sox batters before pinch-hitter Jerry Hairston Sr. came to the plate with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. The Tigers had a 6-0 lead (coincidentally, the same lead Scherzer later had), and while Hairston would go on to have the most successful offensive season of his career in 1983, he looked at this moment like a sacrificial lamb. Seven games into the young season, Hairston hadn’t yet notched a hit.It took one pitch to get his first. Wilcox grimaced on the mound. Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell calls the final inning of Wilcox's near perfect game. Thirty-two years later, the pitcher can describe the moment in vivid detail.The Tigers were on the road, but he remembers the roar as the Chicago crowd rose to its feet and gave him a thunderous ovation while Hairston dug in to the left-handed box. Crowd noise normally sounded like nothing more than a dull buzz when Wilcox was in a groove, but now it filled his ears. He stepped off the mound to gather himself, a moment he says broke his concentration. He looked back in for catcher Lance Parrish’s sign.“My catcher wanted me to throw a split fastball,” he said. “I knew this guy was a first-pitch fastball hitter, but my control was perfect. I was going to run it in on his hands.”He remembers what happened next.“It sailed out over the plate,” Wilcox said.He heard the crack and turned to see the ball skip into the centerfield grass.“It was a good hard single,” he said.He got the next hitter, bringing the game to an unceremonious end, Hairston’s hit making Wilcox the answer to an obscure trivia question instead of a major piece of baseball history.

He’s more likely to think about what came next. The Tigers won the World Series in 1984, and the game of his life as a pitcher, Wilcox said, was his victory over the Kansas City Royals in that year’s American League playoffs. His stuff was even better that night, when he allowed just two hits over eight scoreless innings in the series-clinching win.“It would have been nice to have,” he said matter-of-factly of the perfect game, but losing it didn’t gut him. For the most part, the only time he thinks about it now is when the occasional reporter “calls to remind me of it.”Though social media erupted after Scherzer hit Tabata, debating whether the hitter had leaned into the pitch, the Nationals ace struck a tone similar to that of Wilcox after the game. He didn’t blame Tabata and was “pretty happy” with his performance.Of course, with Tabata on first, Scherzer got Josh Harrison to fly out to seal his no-hitter, a feat that while more common than perfection is still rare. He avoided the fates of Shelby Miller and Carlos Corrasco, two pitchers who this season lost their own no-hit bids on the final out of the game, adding their names to the list of 52 otherswho have done the same.Scherzer, remarkably, lost perfect games after the sixth inning in three consecutive starts, but he can take solace at least in the fact that Mike Mussina, the former Baltimore Oriole and New York Yankee, twice lost perfect games in the ninth inning. The no-hitter against Pittsburgh, according to advanced metrics, wasn’t even Scherzer’s best performance of the season (that was a win over Milwaukee a week earlier).But at some point in the future, perhaps long after his career is over, he’ll no doubt think about what it might have felt like had that slider snapped the way it should have, had Tabata’s elbow not been there, had the ball found Ramos’ mitt and had umpire Mike Muchlinski called it strike three.That moment hit Wilcox a decade ago. After leaving baseball, Wilcox started putting on competitions for “air dogs,” retrievers that sprint down docks and splash into water below after jumping as far as they can. His wife met him long after his baseball career ended, but while digging around, she learned of the spring night in 1983 when Milt Wilcox was damn near perfect. She found a video of the game, and they watched it together.“I had never seen that pitch,” Wilcox said. “I sat down to watch it, and everything came back.” Milt Wilcox pitching against the Kansas City Royals in the 1984 American League playoffs.

2,POLITICS,Republicans Urge Obama Administration To Crack Down On Sanctuary Cities,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-urge-obama-administration-to-crack-down-on-sanctuary-cities_us_55a5370fe4b0b8145f73a258,"Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said ""it's a fiction"" to accuse his department of not enforcing immigration law.",2015-07-14,"WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 14: U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testifies before the House Judiciary Committee about oversight of the department July 14, 2015 in Washington, DC. Johnson was repeatedly asked about the murder of Kate Steinle who was shot and killed in San Francisco alegedly by 45-year-old Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant, a repeat felon who has been deported five times to Mexico. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a563011c00002e0036077c.jpeg?cache=duynvjEp3x&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans accused the Obama administration on Tuesday of putting Americans at risk by allowing localities to opt out of enforcing federal immigration laws.The House Judiciary Committee hosted Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson for a hearing that largely focused on a shooting in San Francisco earlier this month, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant who had been previously deported but had since returned to the U.S. The shooting set off an uproar over so-called sanctuary cities, where local authorities do not fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had been released from prison by San Francisco, a sanctuary city, not by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Nonetheless, Republican lawmakers made it clear on Tuesday that they believed Johnson, as the head of the department that includes ICE, was partially to blame. ""The tragic impact of DHS’s reckless policies on the safety of Americans was made all too apparent in recent weeks,"" said committee chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). He went on to discuss the shooting of a 32-year-old woman allegedly carried out by Lopez-Sanchez, who was released in April by the San Francisco County Sheriff's Department after serving time in prison for illegally reentering the U.S. The shooting called into question policies by more than 300 jurisdictions that decline to cooperate fully with ICE, whether because officials believe it is counterproductive to policing or because of a court ruling that detaining people solely for immigration-related purposes violated the Fourth Amendment.Now, lawmakers are pushing for those sanctuary cities to work with ICE -- a goal Johnson said he shares.""I want to reduce, if not eliminate, the jurisdictions that don't want to cooperate with us,"" the DHS secretary told the committee.But he disagreed sharply with committee Republicans about how that cooperation should occur. Johnson said his agency should continue working to repair relationships with local law enforcement. Lawmakers argued that jurisdictions should be forced to cooperate regardless of local laws and policies or constitutional questions.""When I look at you, I see the secretary of homeland security for the United States of America,"" Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Johnson. ""You shouldn't have to ask San Francisco. You shouldn't have to get their cooperation. You, to me, outrank the city supervisors of San Francisco.""Johnson told the committee that he met with local officials in San Francisco earlier this year and was hopeful they would participate in the new Priorities Enforcement Program, often known as PEP, which is meant to restart cooperation between localities and ICE. He announced last December that DHS would abandon the controversial Secure Communities program in favor of PEP.Under both programs, ICE receives fingerprints of everyone who gets arrested so it can identify the undocumented immigrants among them. But ICE officials say they plan to move away from the Secure Communities approach, which asks local jurisdictions to hold undocumented immigrants regardless of whether they would be otherwise released. Instead, under PEP, the common practice will be to request notification about individuals who are set to be let out.PEP has not yet been fully implemented, but federal officials have visited local leaders in sanctuary cities to plead with them to join. Johnson said on Tuesday that DHS has prioritized 49 jurisdictions that will be urged to cooperate with the agency on immigration enforcement. Thirty-three have agreed, including Los Angeles, he said, while 11 have not yet decided and five have said no. Asked whether San Francisco was one of the jurisdictions that had refused to participate, a DHS spokesman declined to comment further on the discussions.The Democratic Party is urging San Francisco to cooperate with PEP. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) sent a letter to San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee last week encouraging him to join the program. Republicans have already pronounced PEP a failure.""Politely asking for cooperation from sanctuary cities is a fool’s errand,"" Goodlatte said. ""The clear answer to this problem is for DHS to mandate compliance with detainers and for this administration to defend the mandatory nature of detainers in federal court."" GOP lawmakers are pushing for a harsher approach. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) introduced legislation last week that would block funding for jurisdictions that do not fully cooperate with ICE, as did Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) in a separate bill.On Monday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a presidential candidate, announced legislation that would require state and local law enforcement to notify ICE that they were holding an undocumented immigrant and to continue to do so upon ICE's request. His bill would also prevent jurisdictions that did not comply from receiving federal law enforcement grants.Republican lawmakers' criticism at the hearing went beyond ICE's work with local law enforcement. Goodlatte said that the federal government had released 30,558 convicted criminals in fiscal year 2014, 1,423 of whom went on to commit other crimes. Many committee members said too few people are being deported in general and accused DHS of showing little interest in enforcing immigration law. Johnson responded by pointing to the high proportion of people deported who are convicted criminals, recent border-crossers and national security threats.""It is a fiction to say that we are not enforcing the law,"" Johnson said."

Johnson was shortly thereafter dismissed. His attorney said the woman hurled “racial epithets” at Johnson, which TMZ said included, “Get off me, you f****** n*****."" “I totally should have walked away,” he said at another point in the interview. “I am ashamed of that. I’m sorry. I apologize to the lady in the incident, to her family, to my family, to my mother. I know I wasn’t raised that way.”Johnson’s mother told Strahan that when she found out her son had punched a woman in the face, she cried for days. “I wanted to jump through the phone and ring his neck,” she added.“What you saw in the video is not who I am,” Johnson said. “I would like to say to her that I am severely sorry. No words can describe this feeling.""A second Florida State football player, running back Dalvin Cook, is also facing charges for punching a woman outside a bar one day before Johnson.

Part of the problem is that many newborns in the NICU have similar last names and birth dates, the authors note.Along with changing the system for singleton births, Montefiore also switched IDs for multiples, incorporating not just the mother’s first name but also a number. Twins, for example, might now have IDs that say “1Judysboy” and “2Judysboy.”During the study period, under the old naming system, there were 157,857 orders placed for 1,115 babies, while there were 142,337 orders for 1,067 infants under the new guidelines.For every 100,000 orders, the overall retract and reorder rate fell from 59.5 with the old IDs to 37.9 with the new ones, the study found.The reduction was more pronounced for orders placed by doctors in training, and for male babies.One shortcoming of the study is that it didn’t have enough newborns from multiple births to measure how much the new naming system might reduce errors for twins or triplets, who may be at increased risk for mistakes under older ID systems, the researchers acknowledge.It’s also possible that because doctors knew about the new naming system and the rationale behind it, they became more careful with their orders as a result, the authors note.Even so, this naming format has proved effective elsewhere, said Dr. Amir Kushnir, head of neonatology and the NICU at Baruch Padeh Medical Center, Poria Tiberias, Israel.Israeli government hospitals all register babies in the format “WendysGirl Smith,” Kushnir, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.“All patients in the hospital are at risk of misidentification, but the risk of newborns being misidentified is stronger because demographic details of those babies are very similar,” Kushnir said.SOURCE: bit.ly/1MpJy2L Pediatrics, online July 13, 2015."

On last week’s episode of Big Think’s web series “Tuesdays with Bill,” the bowtie-clad scientist responded to a reader’s question about whether being gay makes evolutionary sense.Watch the episode and read the full transcript here.The viewer wrote:If the purpose of a species is to reproduce and survive, how would it make sense evolutionarily for humans to have same-sex preferences? Are humans the only ones who practice homosexuality? And if so does this mean that homosexuality is a product of human’s personal whim as opposed to instinct?Nye notes that he’s “not an authority” on the subject, but points out that homosexuality has been documented among chimps and Bonobos.He doesn’t get into the nitty-gritty on whether homosexuality makes “sense” evolutionary, but instead seems to come to the conclusion that the question isn’t that important -- at least when it comes to how we treat other people.“Let’s celebrate being alive, everybody,” he says. “Apparently it’s something that happens in nature and look, we’re all here.”There is scientific support for the idea that homosexuality has an evolutionary basis. Italian researchers found that the mothers and maternal aunts of gay men tend to have more children than other women. They theorize that the same gene that that might promote homosexuality in men may also promote fertility in women and make them more attractive to men.Contact the author."

Stenberg, who is 16 years old, called out Kylie Jenner for cultural appropriaton and later wrote a detailed post about the double standards that negatively impact black women. Apparently, Stenberg received backlash for expressing her opinions. Stenberg did receive praise for calling out Jenner as a cultural appropriator, but she indicated that others have dismissed her words, labeling her an Angry Black Girl. This is the exact same stereotype Stenberg is preaching against -- those that devalue black women by reducing their emotions and labeling them erratic and irrelevant when they’re everything but. Stenberg’s frustration with the treatment of black lives is valid and shared by many African Americans, both men and women. Yet, to classify her as an “angry black woman” is, like Stenberg said, to undermine her critiques of those who simultaneously borrow from and oppress black people. She's expected to comply with that reality and, apparently, keep her mouth shut about it. That notion is pervasive -- and it is unfair.  The problem is two-fold. The people who fueled Stenberg's latter argument -- that opinions don't make people necessarily angry -- are too busy feeding her initial point, that black women are treated as less than human. Then, perhaps more importantly: If anger is what Stenberg feels, anger is what she should be allowed to express. Her anger should not be invalidated or treated as if it's an emotion only expressed by black women. Black women are constantly dehumanized and exploited which, you're damn right, triggers anger.  The Angry Black Woman trope persists on television shows and in real life -- some of the most influential black women in our country have been labeled Angry Black Women including First Lady Michelle Obama and TV mastermind Shonda Rhimes. Both women have spoken out against it.Black women shouldn’t have to apologize for being angry -- just as we would never apologize for being black. But it is when the two become synonymous where the stereotype flourishes and becomes a bigger battle to fight. Black women are often shamed for our assertiveness and, as in Stenberg’s case, must defend ourselves in order to fight against this idea. Our culture, our opinions and our voices cannot continue to be reduced to ugly stereotypes. But as long as they are, I hope Stenberg keeps those “strong opinions” coming.Be angry, speak up, refuse to be silenced."

While Gigabit Pro is twice as fast as Google Fiber’s top advertised speed, that price is more than four times the $70/month charge for Google’s broadband only service. Even when you get Google Fiber’s bundle with TV service, you’re only looking at $130/month, less than half the cost of Gigabit Pro alone.And then there’s the install cost. Want Gigabit Pro? Be prepared to pay up to $500 for an installation that may take 6-8 weeks to complete (and that’s according to Comcast’s estimate, so take it with a huge grain of salt).But wait! The fine print also says you could also be on the hook for fees of “up to $500 for activation,” bringing the total to $1,000 before you’ve even checked your e-mail on your super-fast connection. Google waives its construction fees for customers signing up for commitments of one year, half the required time to get the Comcast pricing.And then there’s a few final kicks in the butt from Comcast: “Equipment, taxes and fees and other applicable charges extra.” For $299.95/month, the least Comcast could do is not nickel-and-dime you further for equipment fees.As DSLreports.com notes, canceling your Gigabit Pro service would hit you for an early termination fee that could be in the thousands of dollars."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and seven other senators urged in a letter issued last week to multiple federal drug and health officials.""While the federal government has emphasized research on the potential harms associated with the use of marijuana, there is still very limited research on the potential health benefits of marijuana -- despite the fact that millions of Americans are now eligible by state law to use the drug for medical purposes,"" the letter reads. The senators praised the White House's recent lift of what was a mandatory bureaucratic review process, long criticized by researchers and lawmakers alike, that had stifled scientific research into the plant. But, they also encouraged the federal drug and health agencies to do more.For patients in states with active medical marijuana programs, the senators recommend the agencies use their existing tools to collect national data, conduct surveillance and perform clinical trials. ""It is time for the federal government to pick up those tools and use them,"" the letter reads. The senators also implored the agencies to collaborate and support ""independent scientists"" by eliminating needless federal barriers that stifle research into the plant.To date, 23 states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes. Nearly 20 others have legalized the limited medical use of CBD, or cannabidiol, a compound found in the cannabis plant that doesn't produce the euphoric sensation associated with the drug but has shown medical promise. Still, the federal government continues to ban the plant. Under the Controlled Substances Act, the U.S. has five categories for drugs and drug ingredients. Schedule I is reserved for drugs that the DEA considers to have the highest potential for abuse and no medical value. Marijuana has been classified as Schedule I for decades, alongside other substances like heroin and LSD.Critics of federal policy say that the classification is due in part to a lack of cannabis science in the United States, stemming from a federal stranglehold on marijuana research. There's only one federally legal marijuana garden in the U.S., at the University of Mississippi. The National Institute on Drug Abuse oversees the operation, and it's the only source of marijuana for federally sanctioned studies on the drug.Federal authorities have long been accused of funding marijuana research that focuses on the potential negative effects of the substance. The DEA has also been accused of not acting quickly enough when petitioned to reschedule marijuana, and for obstructing science around the drug.Warren was joined by Democratic Sens. Jeffrey Merkley (Ore.), Ron Wyden (Ore.), Barbara Mikulski (Md.), Edward Markey (Mass.), Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) -- about half of whom are cosponsors of a sweeping bill introduced earlier this year designed to drastically reduce the federal government's ability to crack down on state-legal medical marijuana programs while also encouraging more research into the substance.The letter, dated July 9, was addressed to the heads of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and National Institute on Drug Abuse were also copied on the letter.Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Drug Enforcement Administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

But as Iran, the country with the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and second-biggest gas fields, revs up its output, analysts expect the cheap prices that defined 2015 to extend ""well into 2016.""""This is good news for consumers, and bad news for people trying to promote non-fossil fuel alternatives or renewables,"" Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ""It means fossil fuels will remain cheap, and that inhibits some efforts to reduce carbon.""It may be some time before Iran returns to the oil market. Sanctions will only ease once Iran has scaled back its nuclear facilities, likely sometime next year. Major oil projects are unlikely to start before 2017, Amrita Sen, an analyst at London-based consultancy Energy Aspects, told the Financial Times.But while cheap gas may hurt oil giants' bottom lines in the short run, a newly opened Iran would be fertile ground for investments as the sanction-crippled country looks to update its facilities and tap new projects. Already this year, executives from the British-Dutch behemoth Royal Dutch Shell and Italy's Eni visited Iran to discuss possible partnerships. Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of French giant Total SA, met with Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh in Vienna last month.Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer by market value, hired lobbyists to monitor Iranian sanction in May, marking the first time the Texas-based company enlisted outside lobbyists to track the country, according to Bloomberg.""Iran requires a high level of investment to maintain and develop its oil and gas fields, many of which are aging and in need of maintenance and repair,"" Jason Carnovale, an analyst at the market research firm Freedonia Group, told HuffPost in an email. ""Some estimates indicate Iran will need well over $100 billion in foreign investment in drilling, infrastructure, and technology over a period of years."" U.S. companies are still barred from doing business in Iran.  ""With respect to companies that want to rush to do business in Iran, it is absolutely true that because of the embargo by the United States, American companies will not be part of that rush -- unless specifically exempted, and very few are,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday in a speech.In the short term, oilfield services companies -- the biggest of which are Schlumberger and Halliburton -- will benefit the most. European oil companies such as Eni, Shell and Total -- which already operated in a strictly-limited capacity in the country -- would likely be next to invest directly in Iranian oil and gas fields.""Those companies with a history of investment in the country are probably the most likely to resume activity there in the short term,"" Carnovale said, ""although most major oil companies have been mentioned in connection with the possibility of participating in the country's oil industry.""But one major industry with an enormous potential market in Iran -- the arms trade -- will have to wait.Iran's military is long overdue for a facelift. First, Iran must wait another five years for a United Nations arms embargo to expire. A separate ban on missile sales will remain in place for eight years. State-owned Russian and Chinese arms producers will likely be the first leap at a chance to sell weapons and equipment to Iran.""Iran desperately needs to replace just about everything,"" Ben Moores, an analyst at the London-based military research firm IHS Janes, told HuffPost. ""Iran spends a lot of time making announcements about highly technologically capable weapons that they have. But having watched Iran PR closely since 1997, I can say it's exactly the same. All they ever announce is reengineered Russian equipment from the 1960s.""Outfitting Iran's air force with modern equipment alone would cost up to $30 billion, Moores said. As it stands, Iran has been using notoriously shoddy parts from China to maintain its small fleet of American-made F-14 Tomcat fighter jets. Finally reopening trade between its manufacturer, Virginia-based Grumman, and Iran could change eventually change that.""Iran has had no spare parts for those planes since 1979,"" Moores said, referring to the year Iran's Islamic Revolution deposed the U.S.-backed dictator and captured the U.S. embassy. ""The amount of money they must be spending to keep those aircraft in the air -- to keep aircraft that are probably not actually of any real use in the air -- must be enormous.""Andrew Lord contributed reporting."

Labor leaders were joined by immigrant workers in the rally and vowed to defend President Barack Obamas immigration executive actions. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a3cd691b00004d1127fe1c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," This story originally appeared on Citylab. For a country of immigrants, the U.S. can really lack compassion in its discussion of immigration. The latest example of paranoia takes the form of Donald Trump’s ugly portrayal of new arrivals as criminals—a sorry attempt by the political entrant to comb one over on the voting public, and a slap in the face to the very people building his buildings. Toward the far more comfortable end of the sanity spectrum, there are legitimate fears of companies exploiting loopholes in the H-1B immigration program to displace native workers with cheaper labor.But even people with very reasonable concerns over working-class American livelihoods should feel comforted by a recurring trend that appears wherever and whenever people study immigration: as metro areas become more diverse, everyone becomes a lot better off.Take a new discussion paper by researchers Thomas Kemeny of the University of Southampton, in the U.K., and Abigail Cooke of SUNY-Buffalo. Their analysis of Census labor data from 1991 to 2008 tracked changes in wages alongside those of diversity at both the city and individual workplace levels. What they found is that more immigrant workers made everyone richer: as diversity rose one standard deviation in a workplace, wages rose 1.6 percent; a similar rise in the city as a whole increased wages nearly 6 percent.“The key take home message of this paper is that having a diverse group of immigrants in one’s midst offers the average worker tangible economic benefits,” Kemeny tells CityLab via email. “Rather than thinking about immigrants as substitute for natives, our paper considers them to be complements.” The work is just the latest in a long line of evidence, found in many places around the world, suggesting that immigrant diversity increases city productivity. A simple chart of U.S. metro area wages and diversity circa 2007, found in Kemeny and Cooke’s latest study, offers the clearest visualization of the trend. On one axis you have average wages and salary; on the other axis you have “birthplace fractionalization,” aka a range of native countries among workers. As one goes up, so goes the other:This relationship alone doesn’t prove that immigrants are making the difference. Perhaps very productive workers are drawn to live in immigrant cities for some other reason, a problem known to academics as sorting. In that case, the partnership of diversity and productivity might be a coincidence. Kemeny and Cooke tried to overcome the sorting question by focusing on workers who stayed in the same job for at least two years, giving them a window into how individual wages changed in response to the diversity of a city or a workplace. “So sorting can’t be the driver of the relationship we observe,” says Kemeny.That leaves a far more encouraging explanation for what may be happening: the presence of a diverse immigrant workforce prompts interactions between people of varying backgrounds, who then use this new perspective to build on existing ideas or solve rigid problems. In other words, the business becomes smarter as a whole, and thus more productive. At the workplace level that process makes sense; less clear to Kemeny is how diversity makes a city at large more productive. There he turns to Jane Jacobs and the sidewalk ballet—those serendipitous conversations that can only occur in a dense urban setting.“It builds on an idea that Jane Jacobs wrote about long ago with respect to cities, and that scientists today are also observing across a wide range of complex systems: that diversity represents a vital asset that opens up new possibilities, better solutions, and innovations,” he says.That’s not to say every city benefits from immigration equally. On the contrary, Kemeny explains, places more accepting of newcomers reap the most diversity rewards. In other work, he and Cooke have found that cities passing anti-immigrant ordinances benefit less from newcomers than cities with laws encouraging and protecting them. “We take this as evidence that, in immigrant-hostile climates, the kind of ‘bridging’ between different kinds of people that we believe is an important part of our story happens a lot less,” he says. A related 2012 study by Kemeny reports that diversity boosted wages up to 8 percent in cities where public trust is high, but only 1 percent in those where it’s low:At the workplace level the same thing likely holds true. It’s hard to imagine, at the moment, any immigrant Trump employee being particularly eager to help the company innovate.It may not be the case that all types of immigrants have the same effect on productivity. A professional who comes over with an engineering degree and an English fluency seems more poised to immediately help a business than a manual laborer who comes over with a goal of slowly providing a better life for future generations. Here the research is mixed: some suggests diversity among low-wage immigrants leads to fewer benefits than at the high-wage end; some suggests, in Kemeny’s words, that “rising immigrant diversity influences workers across the wage distribution more or less equally.”But the larger point is that immigration isn’t the zero-sum, us-or-them game that it’s often framed as. That’s not to dismiss all fears that foreign-born workers will displace American workers, but simply to state that the benefits of workforce diversity can redound on everyone—especially in cities. Instead of worrying so much about immigrants robbing American jobs, we might start asking what anti-immigration policies are robbing from hard-working American pockets."

The Western Conservative Summit attracts thousands of conservatives and a number of prominent politicians; this year the lineup includes Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, and Scott Walker.

Raised in a church parsonage, Walker scores high on Christian credibility with conservative voters who turn out so reliably in Republican primaries. Here are five faith facts about the Badger State’s two-term governor.1. He’s a P.K.A “pastor’s kid.” Scott Walker’s father is the Rev. Llewellyn Walker, who moved the family from Colorado Sprins to Plainfield, Iowa, for an assistant pastor’s job at the town’s First Baptist Church when the governor was a toddler. The governor’s mother, Patricia Walker, ran the Sunday school.Llewellyn Walker, ordained in the American Baptist Churches USA — considered more moderate on social issues and theology than the larger Southern Baptist denomination — later led the First Baptist Church in Delavan, Wis. The governor preached sermons there as a teenager when his father was too ill to take the pulpit, according to The New York Times.2. His current church is more conservative than his father’s.With eight other Milwaukee-area churches that end in “brook,” Scott Walker’s Meadowbrook Church in Wauwatosa, Wis., is a smaller offshoot of the Elmbrook megachurch, once led by evangelical author and speaker Stuart Briscoe. Religion journalist Richard Ostling wrote in GetReligion that though Walker’s church is nondenominational, it includes “Baptist-style” practices and “upholds typical conservative Protestant theology.” That includes the belief that salvation is available only to those who accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior.3. He left a church that was starting to welcome gays and lean leftward.For more than a decade, Walker worshipped at the Underwood Memorial Baptist Church in Wauwatosa, an American Baptist church that hired a woman pastor in 2003. A year later, it affiliated with the gay-friendly Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists, and placed the rainbow flag of gay liberation on its church sign. Walker then left Underwood, because, many suspected, the then-candidate for governor considered it too liberal.As Kevin Genich, a former Underwood member who knew Walker, told The New York Times: “As soon as we put the flag on the sign, he was out of there.” Walker said he left because he was looking for a place with more opportunities for his two young sons.4. He believes God sent him a message through a devotional after he fell for a prank.During Walker’s 2011 battles with Wisconsin’s unions, a prankster posing as billionaire industrialist David Koch called the governor. Walker told the fake Koch that he had considered planting “troublemakers” among crowds of pro-union protesters to discredit them. By his own admission Walker said that he sounded “pompous” during the taped and widely distributed phone conversation. He also said God was trying to teach him a lesson.When he realized he had been duped, Walker wrote in his book about his trials as governor, he picked up a devotional by evangelist John Maxwell and read that day’s entry: “The power of humility, the burden of pride.”“I hear you, Lord,” Walker recalled saying out loud.5. He punted on evolution and President Obama’s Christianity.Even Walker called it a punt. Liberal broadcaster Rachel Maddow had a field day with his Feb. 11 non-answer when asked if he accepts evolution. Walker’s high school science teacher, the now-retired Ann Serpe, said she had long ago explained evolution to her otherwise bright pupil and that he should have “manned up” to the question.Later that month, Walker said he didn’t know whether President Obama is a Christian, even though Obama has repeatedly spoken publicly about his Christianity. Walker’s spokeswoman later said that Walker knows that the president is Christian, but didn’t appreciate the “gotcha” question.Also on HuffPost:"

""But it’s not about how much you get, it’s about how fair it is."" The gender wage gap, which has remained fairly stable over the past decade, is certainly alive and well in the entertainment industry. The hack against Sony last year shed light on Hollywood's pay disparity between men and women. Emails revealed that Jennifer Lawrence made less than her male co-stars for ""American Hustle."" The hack also led to a personal victory in the gender pay battle for Charlize Theron.After the hack, Theron reportedly negotiated to get paid the same amount as Chris Hemsworth in ""The Huntsman,"" the upcoming prequel to ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" The deal was reportedly worth more than $10 million.However, it's not always possible for women to negotiate their way into wage equality. As Seyfried told The Sunday Times: ""You have to decide if you’re willing to walk away from something, especially as a woman.""H/T BustleAlso On The Huffington Post: "
