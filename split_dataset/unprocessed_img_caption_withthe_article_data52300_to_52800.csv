3,POLITICS,One Of Donald Trump's Favorite Talking Points Is Kind Of Bogus,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-most-votes-reagan-eisenhower_us_577d5f52e4b01edea78c4336,"Yes, Trump got the most GOP primary votes to date -- thanks to millions more voters and way more primaries.",2016-07-06,"Trump's claim that he ""got more votes than anybody in the history of primary elections"" is technically true, but doesn't really take demographic and political changes into account.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d5ffd1800002500fa43b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It’s one of Donald Trump’s favorite proofs of his success: the 13.3 million votes he won in the Republican primaries ― more than war hero Dwight Eisenhower, more than party icon Ronald Reagan.The claim is true, but just as true, and nearly as meaningless, as the fact that Trump also received more primary votes than presidents Abraham Lincoln or George Washington, who ran before primaries were even invented.“It’s true in one sense,” Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley said of Trump’s boast. “But it’s false in the sense of reality.”The United States’ voting age population is two and a half times larger than it was when Eisenhower won the GOP nomination in 1952 (in a brokered convention, actually, after finishing second in total primary votes to Robert Taft). Just as important, many more states now hold binding contests during the primary season than they did in 1980, when Reagan and runner-up George H.W. Bush actively participated in 34 primaries and caucuses. In contrast, all but three states held contests this year.“[Trump’s] trying to pretend he’s the strongest nominee in the history of the Republican Party,” said Texas-based GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak. “I think it’s clear that that’s not true.”The reality TV star-cum-presumptive GOP presidential nominee’s campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post’s queries about his claims. On the stump and in interviews, though, Trump frequently talks about his success in the primaries.“I got more votes than anybody in the history of primary elections,” Trump told Breitbart News last month. “Nobody’s ever even gotten close, the Republicans. I got more than Ronald Reagan, I got more than Richard Nixon, I got more than Dwight Eisenhower, I got more than anybody.”That boast, while technically accurate, ignores that millions more Americans of voting age are alive today than even four years ago, let alone four decades ago.In 1980, Ronald Reagan won 7.7 million votes in the Republican contests in a country that had more than 80 million fewer people of voting age. Further, more than a dozen states held non-binding caucuses that the candidates largely ignored. Adjusting for the population increase and the number of meaningful primary contests today, Reagan likely would have won close to 14 million votes ― significantly more than Trump received, according to a HuffPost analysis.Adjusting George W. Bush’s 12 million votes from 2000 the same way suggests he might have won 14.5 million votes. And adjusting 1952’s numbers, Eisenhower might have received 13.6 million votes, while Taft might have won 18.6 million ― both more than Trump received.But the biggest GOP winner in modern times, according to the HuffPost analysis, was Richard Nixon in 1960, when the sitting vice president won 5 million votes in just 13 contests ― suggesting Nixon could have won 25.6 million votes with today’s voting population and primary schedule.“Trump is right that he’s done well, but he exaggerates the historic nature of it,” historian Brinkley said. “The fact of the matter is that he’s barely got enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot.”Josh Putnam, a University of Georgia political scientist and an expert on the parties’ nominating processes, said making comparisons across the decades is difficult. Some states had open primaries at one time, and closed primaries at another. Races that drag on have higher interest and turnout than quickly decided ones. And the number of candidates matters, too, Putnam said, adding that he gives credit to Trump for accumulating his vote total despite a crowded field.Still, the boast of most primary votes ever is misleading, Putnam agreed. “Yeah, that claim from Trump only ever went so deep,” he said.Mackowiak said more important than the number of votes Trump received was his proportion of the total. According to the RealClearPolitics, Trump’s 13.3 million votes in the GOP contests constitute about 47 percent of those cast.“We’ve almost never had a nominee who didn’t win a majority of the votes. Romney, McCain, Bush ― they all had the majority,” Mackowiak said, referring to the last three GOP presidential nominees.Brinkley, though, suspects Trump’s boasts are not necessarily designed for close observers of politics. “Trump is a student of the great American art form of exaggeration,” he said. “Trump is trying to create a perception for people that aren’t following it closely.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

On one hand, photographs make incredible mementos. On the other hand, there’s something to be said for simply enjoying an experience technology-free.However, if you’re among those with a photography obsession, new research suggests that you might be onto something.A study recently published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that stopping to take a picture may enhance certain experiences, making them more enjoyable for the picture-taker. During the study, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California and Yale University observed over 2,000 participants engaging in nine different activities, which included eating lunch, watching a Rihanna concert, taking a virtual bus tour, doing arts and crafts and walking through a museum.For each experiment, researchers instructed half of the group to take pictures of their experience, while the other half was instructed to go about the experience sans camera. After each activity, the group completed a questionnaire that measured their levels of enjoyment and engagement.In nearly all of the settings, the researchers found that participants who took pictures enjoyed their experiences more than those who did not take photos.“One critical factor that has been shown to affect enjoyment is the extent to which people are engaged with the experience,” the authors wrote in the study, adding that photo-taking naturally draws people into an experience. The study also showed that participants who took pictures were more attentive toward the subject of their photos.During the museum experiment, for example, researchers gave participants eye-tracking glasses to track how long and how frequently participants looked at certain artifacts. The study found that those who took pictures were more fixated on the focal pieces of the museum exhibit.Snapping the photo isn't the only element that enhanced experience. The researchers also found that even the act of planning to take a picture could increase enjoyment.For example, when researchers asked participants in the virtual bus tour to simply think about what pictures they would have taken, they reported a higher sense of satisfaction.So why do people who take pictures tend to enjoy their experiences more? According to the researchers, it's because they feel more engaged. “Unlike traditional dual-task situations that divide attention, capturing experiences with photos actually focuses attention onto the experience, particularly on aspects of the experience worth capturing,” the authors wrote.Before you break out your selfie stick, know that the researchers did identify some exceptions.For instance, when participants were already engaged in an activity or when taking a picture interfered with the experience, their enjoyment was nearly equal to those who didn't take photos.When the experience wasn’t enjoyable to begin with, taking a picture actually decreased the participants’ enjoyment of the experience.The researchers also acknowledged gaps in the knowledge of how pictures affect our memory of an experience and how our individual beliefs about taking pictures affect our ability to get enjoyment through taking a picture. But for now, keep snappin’ those sunsets -- you won’t regret it."

9,POLITICS,"Obamacare Unkind To Smokers, New Study Finds",Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-smokers-study_us_577d3de2e4b0a629c1ab828a,"Charging tobacco users more just makes them stay uninsured, Yale researchers say.",2016-07-06,Smokers facing high surcharges for health insurance were less likely to be insured in 2014.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d402919000025002199e0.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Affordable Care Act rules that allow health insurance companies to charge higher premiums to tobacco users are undermining the law's aim of expanding health coverage, a study published Wednesday suggests.Smokers eligible for the Obamacare exchanges were 7.3 percentage points less likely to have health coverage than nonsmokers in 2014, Yale University researchers found by analyzing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other sources.One of the hallmarks of the Affordable Care Act is its prohibition against health insurance companies setting prices based on health status and medical history, including a ban on rejecting customers with pre-existing conditions. The sole exception to this standard is that tobacco users may be charged up to one and a half times the price that a nonuser pays for the same insurance plan.The argument behind this policy is that people who smoke or chew tobacco generally have higher long-term health care costs, so they should be made to pay more. In addition, the higher premiums are meant to serve as an incentive to quit using tobacco, particularly when paired with another Affordable Care Act rule that requires insurers to cover cessation programs without charging copayments.Americans like the idea: A Gallup survey two years ago found that 58 percent of respondents believe greater health insurance premiums for smokers are ""justified.""But anti-smoking organizations like the American Cancer Society and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids have warned that surcharges on health insurance for tobacco will simply cause many users to remain uninsured because they can't afford the coverage. Thus, these tobacco users would continue to lack access to medical care and tobacco cessation programs.Based on the new study, which appeared Wednesday in the journal Health Affairs, that appears to be just what happened.Obamacare has brought the national uninsured rate down to a historic low -- but it appears to be leaving some tobacco users behind. The new analysis suggests this is true, despite other evidence that many smokers simply report that they don't use tobacco to avoid paying extra.And because smoking is more common among lower-income people, that means Obamacare is failing to reach a portion of those it is designed to help the most.According to separate CDC data, more than one-quarter of people below the poverty line use tobacco, compared to 15 percent of Americans with higher incomes. In 2008, Gallup also found a strong inverse correlation between income and smoking.Although the Affordable Care Act permits insurers to charge tobacco users up to 50 percent more than nonsmokers, most states have established lower maximum surcharges, and insurers are not required to assess the full amount or any surcharge at all. Six states and the District of Columbia, meanwhile, did away with the extra cost to tobacco users entirely. Crucially, the tobacco surcharge can't be paid using the health insurance tax credits available to people with low and moderate incomes. Those subsidies are based on income and on the base price for the insurance, not counting a tobacco surcharge.The size of the surcharge, unsurprisingly, plays a major role in how much it drives down health insurance enrollments, the Yale researchers found. Smokers in states with surcharges below 10 percent were virtually as likely to be covered as smokers in states without surcharges, the study shows. As surcharges get bigger, the effects are dramatic. The likelihood of coverage among smokers in states with tobacco surcharges between 10 percent and 29 percent was 4.3 percentage points lower than for smokers in states with no surcharge. The difference was 11.6 percentage points in states where the surcharge ranged from 30 percent to 50 percent. Smokers under 40 were even more prone to go uninsured rather than buy health insurance with any surcharge, the study found. These younger adults in high-surcharge states were 19.9 percentage points less likely to get insurance than smokers in the same age range who were subject to little or no surcharge.Because young adults are generally less costly to insure than older people -- including tobacco users in the short term, according to a 2014 University of Tennessee study -- the surcharge policy may be keeping away the customers most needed to stabilize the health insurance market and keep down premiums for everyone who uses an exchange or buys plans via a broker or directly from an insurer.And going without health insurance can be less expensive for tobacco users than for non-users. The Affordable Care Act's individual mandate requires nearly everyone to have health coverage or pay a fine, but there are exceptions. One is that anyone whose cheapest insurance option costs more than 8 percent of household income is exempt. The University of Tennessee study found this made tobacco users more likely to find coverage unaffordable and thus not be subject to the mandate.What's more, the Yale analysis also found, Obamacare rules requiring that tobacco cessation programs are covered with no out-of-pocket costs aren't working, either, because of the surcharges.Smokers in states with low surcharges were actually less likely than smokers in no-surcharge states to participate in quitting programs, while higher surcharges didn't have a statistically significant effect either way, the study found. ""This suggests that tobacco surcharges increased neither smoking cessation nor financial protection from high health care costs -- the primary goal of the Affordable Care Act,"" the authors conclude."

In response, residents launched a “civil resistance campaign” against the group’s militant rule that has now lasted more than 100 days, making it one of the longest protests of its kind since 2011.“Civil resistance in Syria is one of the most under-reported parts of the conflict; outsiders have this narrow view of the conflict as just a few armed groups killing each other,” Mulham Sameer, a Syrian activist and a co-organizer of the campaign, told Syria Deeply. “But the truth is, there are thousands of Syrians who still strongly believe in peaceful resistance. That is the spirit of our uprising.”Some 80,000 people live in Maarat al-Numan, including a significant number of displaced Syrians who fled neighboring towns. The Free Syrian Army (FSA) gained full control of Maarat al-Numan in October 2012 following intense battles with the Syrian army.But today demonstrators in Maarat al-Numan have more than one enemy to protest: ISIS, al-Qaida affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and other extremist groups, all of whom are seen by civilians as equally terrifying as the Syrian government.“We have enemies on all fronts now; our enemy is anyone who tries to suppress the Syrian people’s call for freedom and dignity,” Sameer said, “and just as we made the Syrian government realize that its warplanes and rockets can’t kill our hunger from freedom, it’s now al-Qaida’s turn to realize that.”The current campaign against extremist factions began in early March, after an antigovernment demonstration in Maarat al-Numan was attacked by members of opposition faction Jaish al-Fatah (the Army of Conquest), an alliance of extremist rebel factions that includes Jabhat al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham and Jund al-Aqsa. They even went as far as burning the Syrian revolution flag and assaulting demonstrators.A few days later, Jaish al-Fatah (JaF) imposed a ban on revolution flags and any other flags besides al-Nusra’s black flag in the city. On the same day, JaF forces attacked a major demonstration organized by members of the 13th Division of the FSA, a rebel group based in Maarat al-Numan and supported by the Syrian National Council, the opposition’s main political party. The group has publicly rejected the ideologies of both ISIS and al-Qaida along with their presence in Syria.Residents of the town told Syria Deeply that Nusra militants avoided any clashes with the protesters, staying on the outskirts of the town where it has two checkpoints, but locals believe that JaF acted on Nusra’s orders. In many areas of opposition-controlled Syria, especially in rural Idlib, Jabhat al-Nusra is now seen as a foreign power, which is why residents often side with the local FSA factions when clashes erupt with extremist groups.“Al-Nusra and its allies couldn’t accept pro-revolution slogans, and tried to disperse the demonstration, arresting 50 protesters,” said Sameer. “It’s important to understand that the 13th Division is not like any rebel group in Idlib. It originated from Maarat al-Numan and its fighters are natives of the town. That’s why any assault on them is an assault on the locals.”The arrests sparked outrage among local residents, who then transformed their demonstrations against the government into a campaign against extremist factions, particularly Jabhat al-Nusra, titled: ‘‘Enough is Enough.’’What began as a set of popular demonstrations has now turned into daily acts of civil resistance in Maarat al-Numan. Every day, dozens of residents gather in the town center and demand that Jabhat al-Nusra be held accountable for its alleged crimes, all arms be returned to the FSA-backed 13th Division and that all detainees be released.The campaign’s organizers claim they are ensuring that all protests remain peaceful and that no violence is being used. Local activists distributed pamphlets, organized sit-ins and made placards, all calling for an end to extremism.“We want justice for the 13th Division fighters, who are the sons, brothers and husbands of these protesters,” Abdalkader Laheb, journalist at the Syrian Revolution Network and a native of Maarat al-Numan, told Syria Deeply. So far, the campaign has been granted only one of its demands. The last three demonstrators were freed earlier this week, more than four months after their arrest, Sameer said, but demonstrators have now taken on a bigger goal. “It’s no longer about the detained protesters or the killed 13th Division Fighters. We don’t want al-Nusra or any of its allies in our town, and the campaign will only end when all al-Qaida-affiliated factions leave,” Sameer said.The campaign now aims to bring back the town’s spirit of peaceful resistance “after six years of bombardment, death and destruction,” Laheb said. “Our revolution is a peaceful one, and anyone who tries to hijack it by using intolerance, sectarianism or violence will be faced with our peaceful, yet firm resistance.”This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577cd5f1190000240021984e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The French intelligence services failed in their duty and could have avoided the worst of the deadly terrorist attacks that rocked Paris in 2015, a scathing report to be released next week finds.The country's parliamentary commission outlined the report on “the worst attack on French soil since the end of World War II” ahead of publication on Tuesday. The 30-member commission was created in January to examine the coordinated assaults in France's capital that killed 147 people. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the November attacks, which followed a deadly shooting spree by extremists on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket in Paris in January 2015.Georges Fenech, president of the commission, said that better coordination among the French intelligence services would have prevented the deadliest of the November attacks, at Bataclan concert hall.“Our intelligence services have failed,” he said at a news conference on Tuesday that announced the commission’s findings and proposals. “All, I say all of them, the attackers of the Bataclan, those of Charlie Hebdo, those of the Hyper-Kosher (store) ... and others were all on the radar of our services.”""We could have avoided the attack of the Bataclan if there had not been these failures,” Fenech added.He noted that Saleh Abdeslam, a surviving attacker from the November massacres, was able to escape to Belgium afterward, and Abdelhamid Abaaoud -- the man authorities believe was a key organizer -- had traveled freely in Europe despite European authorities’ awareness of his radical activities.The commission made 40 recommendations for reforms, including the creation of a centralized counter-terrorism intelligence agency like the National Counterterrorism Center that the United States created after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.It also proposed increasing France’s role in efforts to drive the Islamic State out of Iraq and working with Turkey to secure its border with Syria. Abaaoud fought with the extremist group in Syria before returning to Europe.The commission leaders added that other countries' intelligence failures and the lack of coordination between France and its European partners enabled the attacks, rather than French missteps alone. Abdeslam's name did not appear on a European Union data, despite the fact he was known to Belgian authorities as an extremist. French authorities stopped Abdeslam’s car near the border with Belgium  hours after the November attacks. They allowed him to proceed when his file showed a criminal record, not a history of terrorism involvement.The commission recommends improving Europe-wide terrorist prevention efforts in response to this. These include granting Europol, the EU's police agency, and Frontex, its border control agency, full access to the Schengen Information System -- a master list of missing and wanted individuals.It is expected to release its full report on the November attacks next Tuesday.The commission’s recommendations are not binding, but they are likely to ratchet up pressure on the French government and other European countries to enact major changes. Last year's Paris attacks, along with bombings in Brussels in March that Islamic State claimed, have revealed major gaps in European security policies.In related developments, a Paris court sentenced the brother of one of the Paris attackers to nine years' jail on Wednesday for traveling to Syria to train as a militant fighter in 2013, Reuters news agency reports. Karim Mohammed-Aggad's brother Foued was one of the attackers who killed 90 people in the Bataclan theater. In Belgium, a court convicted 15 people for plotting a terrorist attack on Tuesday. Several of the convicted criminals had been in close contact with Abaaoud, the suspected leader of the Paris attacks."

17,POLITICS,Obama Again Extends Troop Presence In Afghanistan,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-troops-afghanistan-8400_us_577d1c05e4b0a629c1ab6518,"The president said 8,400 troops will be there when he leaves office.",2016-07-06,"President Barack Obama said Wednesday that there will be 8,400 troops in Afghanistan when he leaves office, an increase from a previous announcement that there would be 5,500.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d1da51800002500fa425f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama again stalled the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, announcing on Wednesday that he plans to keep 8,400 American troops there through the remainder of his presidency. Prompted by continued Taliban gains and the threat of an Islamic State stronghold in the country, the move is a departure from his previous plan to decrease the current level of nearly 10,000 troops to 5,500 by the end of 2016.In an appeal to a war-weary population that has grown cynical of a seemingly endless war in Afghanistan, Obama listed a series of successes of the U.S. effort there: the death of Osama bin Laden, a weakened al-Qaeda presence, the withdrawal of 90 percent of American troops, and the fact that Afghan security forces now control major population centers. “Nevertheless, the security situation in Afghanistan remains precarious,” said Obama, who was flanked by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Even as they improve, Afghan security forces are still not as strong as they need to be,"" he added. The president arrived at the number 8,400 after learning lessons from the past two fighting seasons, a senior administration official told reporters in a conference call immediately after Obama’s remarks.Wednesday’s announcement marks the latest official prolongment of the nearly 15-year war that Obama promised to end in his early days in office. Although Obama heeded the military’s requests for a troop surge in the early years of his presidency, he has said consistently that he would end the war before leaving office. But advances by the Taliban have prompted Obama to repeatedly extend his self-imposed deadlines for pulling troops out of Afghanistan. Obama vowed in May 2014 to end combat operations by the end of the year, leave 9,800 residual troops in Afghanistan through 2015, cut that number in half in 2016, and have only a small presence to guard the U.S. embassy by the end of this year. Although Obama announced an end to the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan in December 2014, the statement appeared largely ceremonial as troops were still authorized to conduct dangerous counterterrorism missions. Indeed, 38 American military personnel and civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the last year-and-a-half, Obama said Wednesday. After the Taliban drove Afghan forces from the city of Kunduz last year, Obama readjusted his timetable, announcing plans to keep the nearly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan through most of 2016, and leave 5,500 troops into 2017.Obama said Wednesday that his decision to keep a larger troop presence in Afghanistan through 2017 was partially motivated by a desire to give his successor more “flexibility.” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has in the past backed the president’s decision to leave a small contingent of troops in Afghanistan in an advisory role to support and train the local forces. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has said that invading Afghanistan was a mistake, but that troops should remain in the country. ""My decision today also sends a message to the Taliban and all those who have opposed Afghanistan’s progress,” Obama said, adding that a full drawdown of foreign forces from Afghanistan can only happen if the Afghan government and the Taliban reach a negotiated reconciliation."
18,POLITICS,NATO’s Uneasy New Reality: Could It Still Stop Russia?,David Wood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nato-russia-baltics-defense_us_5776aca3e4b0a629c1a9e515,"Not fast enough, some experts say, even as Vladimir Putin probes its defenses.",2016-07-06,"Russian T-90A tanks roll through Moscow's Red Square during a Victory Day parade in May, marking the 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577687c91900002400218f75.jpeg?cache=pthsOVe6wI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One Monday afternoon in June, several hundred American, British and Polish troops parachuted into central Poland. Last month's jump was just practice, part of an extended NATO rehearsal for a defense of northern Europe against Russia.But in a real crisis -- if those soldiers were called to defend the Baltic states -- they could be dropping into a death trap.The mile-long drop zone in north-central Poland was just 180 miles from the major Russian military base at Kaliningrad, well within range of Russian missiles designed to shoot down aircraft like the lumbering C-17s that slowed to drop the paratroopers. Once on the ground, the lightly armed soldiers would likely be targeted by swarms of Russian drones and blasted by long-range Russian artillery, as Ukrainian troops were just last year. The allied paratroopers were practicing to secure a land corridor and a river crossing so that a column of lightly armored U.S. Stryker vehicles could then race to help defend Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from Russian incursion. Those Strykers that survived massed artillery and rocket barrages would have to funnel into Lithuania along a 60 mile-wide stretch of the border, squeezed between Belarus, a Russian ally to the south, and the guns of Kaliningrad to the north. It’s known locally as the Suwalki Gap.In U.S. military terms, a kill zone.War games like these are increasing in scope and intensity, as NATO’s northern flank is once again a global flash point. The Western alliance’s Baltic members lie in the shadow of a newly aggressive Russia, rearmed and ready to take advantage. Those three countries were once part of its Cold War empire, and Russian President Vladimir Putin considers them “our historic territory.” But now NATO is committed to come to their aid if summoned. President Barack Obama specifically swore to defend them.Any clash would raise the risk of unplanned escalation and the implicit threat of nuclear weapons. So shoring up NATO’s border defenses is on the agenda as alliance leaders gather for this week's summit in Warsaw -- along with terrorism, the tidal wave of refugees and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.But managing this confrontation with Russia, with its powerful Cold War antecedents, is more than a matter of troop strength. The inevitable disputes will require delicate handling and steady nerves in the Kremlin and the White House. Western leaders, including the next president -- possibly Donald Trump -- will have to find ways to reassure the Baltics without provoking Moscow into a mounting crisis.A decade ago, it seemed like a low-risk commitment to absorb the Baltic states and other Eastern European nations into NATO with the promise to defend them at any cost. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia was struggling with its own political and economic woes. With little direct threat, the United States had withdrawn the bulk of its Cold War military forces from Europe, and most NATO countries had reduced their own defenses. Then, while the U.S. and NATO were busy in Iraq and Afghanistan, Putin rebuilt his military into a powerful high-tech force. Two years ago, he used it to grab the semi-autonomous region of Crimea. Last year Russian forces seized a chunk of Ukraine in a display of combat power that stunned American generals. That was “a real wake-up call,” Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster told a congressional committee in April. McMaster runs the Army’s most elite think tank, the Army Capabilities Integration Center, and he’s leading a crash study of the Russian military threat and how the U.S. should respond. He told Congress that the Russians have the ability to jam and blind U.S. military communications. He said the networks of Russian missiles and artillery could put at risk the aircraft on which the U.S. relies to counter enemy air defenses and jam enemy communications, attack tank formations and support friendly ground troops. Russia’s long-range artillery, he said, is “more lethal” than anything the U.S. can field.In an extraordinary admission, McMaster told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the United States and its European allies can no longer assume they have superiority in the air, on land or at sea. “What we’ve seen broadly here is that we cannot rely on maintaining dominance in any domain,” he said.The Pentagon’s top brass were particularly struck by one 2014 incident, described in an account by Phillip Karber and Joshua Thibault for the Potomac Foundation, a Washington area think tank. In July of that year, Russia attacked two Ukrainian tank battalions with long-range artillery and multiple rocket-launchers firing smart top-attack munitions and enormously powerful thermobaric warheads. “This intensely concentrated fire strike lasted only a few minutes,” they reported, “yet inflicted high casualties and destroyed most armored vehicles, rendering both battalions combat-ineffective.”If Putin ran the same lightning land-snatch in the Baltic states, his forces could smash through NATO defenses and occupy at least two Baltic capitals within 60 hours, according to a series of war games conducted by the Rand Corporation, the nonpartisan defense think tank. That would leave U.S. and European leaders with two bad choices, Rand concluded: Do nothing, effectively ceding parts of NATO to Russia, or escalate into an all-out “bloody counter-offensive” that could lead to the brink of a nuclear exchange.Already, Putin is accusing NATO of reckless provocation. The Russian president recently signed off on a new military strategy clearly aimed at countering the Western alliance, which he accuses of encroaching on Russian sovereignty and creating “a threat to the national security” to his country. In a June 22 speech he drew a parallel between the 1941 Nazi invasion of Russia and the recent NATO exercises. “NATO is stepping up its aggressive rhetoric and its aggressive actions close to our borders,” he said. In response, he said Russia was “obliged” to strengthen its defenses, placing three new divisions in the region nearest the Baltics.The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to repeated requests to discuss these issues.Pushback from Washington has been firm. The White House has proposed tripling the U.S. budget for NATO defense, to $3.4 billion in 2017, which would enable the Army to add a heavy armored brigade and an F-15 tactical fighter squadron in Europe and to beef up special forces and anti-submarine patrols. “We don’t seek a cold, let alone a hot, war with Russia,” Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on May 3. “We don’t seek to make Russia an enemy. But make no mistake, we will defend our allies.”Moscow’s actions and rhetoric, he added, raise “troubling questions about Russia’s leaders’ commitments to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to the brandishing of nuclear weapons.”Western concern is rising high enough that at this week’s summit, NATO leaders are expected to approve a plan to bolster the alliance’s defenses by stationing a battalion in each of the three Baltic states and one in Poland. That’s four new battalions, roughly 4,000 troops overall. Russia will likely respond, perhaps by carrying out its old threat to install nuclear-capable short-range Iskander ballistic missiles in Kaliningrad, well within range of the Baltics. Moreover, those additional NATO troops, expected to be drawn from U.S. and European armies, will face at least 22 full-strength Russian battalions across the border. “That isn’t going to stop a determined Russian advance,” Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told HuffPost. “But it would build a pretty robust tripwire. The Russians would have to consider that they’d kill a lot of Americans.” For anxious countries like Estonia, having an American or European battalion on local soil would be enormously reassuring, underscoring that an attack on their country would bring an armed response from NATO. The message to Russia is that “if you cross that line, you are at war against 28 countries,” said Eerik Marmei, Estonia’s ambassador to Washington.Still, the clear imbalance of forces disturbs senior combat leaders like Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges. He commands all U.S. Army forces in Europe, and over his career, he has watched the gradual withdrawal of most U.S. forces from the continent.“When I was a young lieutenant in [Cold War] Germany, we had 300,000 troops and the mission was to deter Russia and reassure the allies,” he told HuffPost. “Now I have 30,000 troops and the mission is to deter Russia and reassure the allies.”What he’s seen the Russians do in Ukraine over the last few years sharpens his concern. “They have massive amounts of artillery and rockets, cluster munitions. … It’s a very, very lethal battlefield. And there’s a significant increase in electronic warfare, jamming. And dropping drones out of the sky,” he said. “Things are a bit more dangerous.”Not long ago -- when Hodges was a fresh lieutenant -- the East-West border region was the most heavily armed place on earth, where generals joked that one more tank, one more artillery shell, one more nuclear warhead might cause the whole thing to tilt and slide into the ocean. Indeed, for centuries, the tectonic plates of empire and alliance have ground against one another here, generating rivalries that regularly erupted in violence. During the past century alone, German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires, as well as the Nazi Third Reich, clashed in brutal upheavals that killed millions, smashed nations to pieces and generated animosities that burn to this day.Since the Cold War sputtered to an end a quarter-century ago, the focus of four American presidents and the U.S. defense establishment has shifted to the turbulent Middle East, Iraq and Afghanistan. They hoped, too, to sustain a cordial relationship with the Kremlin. Behind Russia’s borders, though, Putin was planning and preparing to reassert its power. “Russia never went anywhere. We just quit paying attention,” Gen. Mark A. Welsh, the U.S. Air Force chief of staff, remarked at a Council on Foreign Relations conference in May.Until recently, American and allied military forces were assumed to be easily superior to the Russians, who were weakened by post-Cold War neglect. Exercises like the one that recently brought paratroopers to Poland rarely took place -- they seemed relatively unnecessary. Now the U.S. military is racing to catch up, dusting off big-war skills it hasn’t used since 9/11. Artillerymen, who were widely diverted to serve as infantry troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, are back to practicing artillery skills. At the Army training center in the Mojave Desert, battalions have abandoned counterinsurgency training and turned instead to major tank battles and coordinating maneuvers with artillery, airstrikes and electronic warfare.And after 15 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, where there was no threat from the sky, American troops are relearning how to protect themselves from spy drones and attack jets. For the first time in a generation, the paratroopers involved in the recent NATO exercise jumped wearing green-and-black camouflage face paint. Once on the ground, they slung camouflage nets over their positions and practiced “jumping” their command post frequently to avoid detection.But that won’t be enough, according to the Rand war games, in which senior U.S. military officers and defense officials played the roles of Russian and NATO commanders. In various realistic scenarios, they found that American paratroopers “can put up stout resistance when dug into urban terrain.” But “these forces likely could not be resupplied or relieved before being overwhelmed.”“By and large,” the Rand study said, “NATO’s infantry found themselves unable even to retreat successfully and were destroyed in place.”A recent study by the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College came to the same conclusion: NATO, it said, “lacks the capability to defeat a surprise Russian conventional attack into the Baltic States or Eastern Europe.”Such conclusions were met with skepticism aboard the C-17s that carried the 82nd Airborne paratroopers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to Poland.“Everybody here has read the Rand report,” Maj. Robert Lodewick told HuffPost, dismissing the idea that the division is unprepared.“Know your enemy, respect your enemy -- but we’re clearly not scared of them,” Col. Anthony G. Judge, the division’s operations officer, said as he prepared to jump into Poland to set up the assault command post.  If the Russians were to block signals from GPS satellites, which provide data for U.S. military navigation and targeting, paratroopers are trained to fight from paper maps. “We can fight digitally,” said Capt. Daniel Oberrender, an intelligence officer. “But we really fight with maps -- we are an analog force.”To guard against being left electronically blind and mute, the paratroopers carry multiple satellite and FM encrypted communications systems hardened against jamming. “Is it reasonable that they could shut us down? No,” said Lt. Col. Patrick Roddy, commander of the 82nd Airborne’s 1st Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, whose troopers jumped into Poland. “If we get jammed, we quickly go to another system.”The 82nd Airborne and other units train extensively with the Air Force and the Pentagon’s cyber war agencies, using electronic warfare and strike fighters to take out enemy missile sites and ensure that the C-17s can get safely into contested airspace to deliver the paratroopers and their weapons.Once they’re on the ground, language and cultural differences can hamper coordination among soldiers from multiple nations as they maneuver in the dark with lethal weapons (using blanks, for this exercise). “If our communication situation isn’t locked down tight, it will all fall apart,” Roddy warned his soldiers before they jumped.Managing the larger NATO-Russia confrontation presents far greater challenges even in peacetime, let alone during a crisis.How much should the allies beef up their military defenses at the risk of provoking an unwanted response from the Kremlin? At what point during a period of growing tension does it make sense to reassure the Baltic states by sending in paratroopers? If Russia makes even vague threats to shoot down the incoming C-17s, should Washington go ahead and risk the soldiers’ lives? Or back down? Or threaten to escalate and take out Russia’s anti-aircraft missile sites?A more likely crisis might begin with the kind of creeping Russian aggression that Moscow will deny and that falls short of the kind of overt attack that would trigger a NATO response. It might look like what happened in Crimea in February 2014, when Kremlin-backed partisans engineered pro-Russian demonstrations and clashed with counter-demonstrators, sparking demands that Putin act to protect the Russian-speaking population. Within a week, Russian special forces, called Spetsnaz, had snuck in to seize key government facilities, and more troops followed.Defense Secretary Carter has referred to this kind of escalating political intervention, especially Russia’s use of unidentified paramilitary troublemakers, as the “little green men” scenario. (It’s also brilliantly dramatized in the Norwegian series “Occupied.”)The provocateurs might find willing listeners among the many native Russians living in the Baltics -- over 1 million, according to the final Soviet census in 1989. Ambassador Marmei noted that roughly a quarter of Estonia’s population is Russian-speaking, although he said they are thoroughly integrated into Estonian society. Still, he acknowledged the difficulty of dealing with low-level Russian intimidation and political meddling that could lead to direct intervention.“It’s one thing if a tank crosses your border,” he told HuffPost. “But if you have Spetsnaz infiltrating and starting uprisings somewhere, how do you deal with that? Where do you draw the line? When is it Article 5?” he said, referring to the NATO common defense clause.“There is this gray area that NATO has not been very good in dealing with,” he added. Marmei did not specifically mention the alliance’s fumbling response in Ukraine, but the implication was hard to miss.Part of Russia’s current strategy, according to the nonprofit Institute for the Study of War, is to continue “a campaign of information warfare against the Baltic States paired with political pressure and military provocation,” such as snap military exercises simulating massive attacks into those countries.“Right now we see a lot of intimidation by Russia,” Marmei said, including flights by military aircraft along the Baltic Sea corridor. Although that’s a major route for commercial air traffic, he said the Russians often fly with their identifying transponders turned off, making it impossible for air controllers to track them. “We tell the Russians, ‘Please turn on your transponders.’ But they don’t,” Marmei said. “How do you deal with these situations if the other party doesn’t want to listen?”"

22,RELIGION,What Pope Francis Has To Say To Ultraconservatives In The Church,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-pope-francis-has-to-say-to-ultraconservatives-in-the-church_us_577d3abae4b0a629c1ab805c,Haters gon' hate.,2016-07-06,Pope Francis has ruffled some feathers in the Vatican.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d3cdf19000024002199ca.jpeg?cache=E4wd3RIBSU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis has won the hearts of many Catholics and non-Catholics alike, but not all those in the Vatican are as enamored with their Holy Father.The pontiff’s crusade to foster an open and inclusive church has found him reaching out to atheists, relaxing church rules on divorce, and even apologizing to the world’s gay community on behalf of the entire church. For these and other surprising moments, many Catholic conservatives are nonplussed with the Argentine pope.In a recent interview with Argentinian newspaper La Nación, Francis responded to a question about his opponents in the church by saying simply, “They do their work and I do mine.”“I want a church that is open, understanding, that accompanies families who are hurting,” he continued. “I continue my course without looking over my shoulder. I don’t cut off heads.

Ryan said, from what he understands, Trump’s staff -- and not the candidate himself -- was responsible for the tweet. “This is like the fifth time that Donald Trump, who you are supporting, I may remind you, has tweeted something,” Sykes said. “At some point does Reince Priebus, does somebody else, need to get him on the phone? And say Mr. Trump: ‘You’ve got to stop tweeting these things. These things are no longer accidents.’” “I really believe he’s got to clean up the way his [social] media works,” Ryan said. “He’s got to clean this up.”After deleting the initial tweet, Trump tweeted the image of the presumptive Democratic nominee again, but with a circle containing the words, “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!”Trump also denied that the star on the original tweet was anti-Semitic, calling it a “Sheriff’s Star, or plain star.”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

For that alone, I owe him a deep debt of gratitude. But far more important, I am thankful to him for modeling, for me and so many others, how to live a life dedicated to public service.

I send my deepest condolences to Zoe, to Mary, Laurie, and Rachel, and to all their families. May his memory be a blessing.Mikva's first brush with politics came in 1948 as a University of Chicago law student, when he approached a city ward boss about volunteering for the Democratic campaigns of gubernatorial candidate Adlai Stevenson and senatorial candidate Paul Douglas.""The quintessential Chicago ward committeeman takes the cigar out of his mouth, says, 'Who sent you, kid?' And I said, 'Nobody sent me.' He puts the cigar back in his mouth and said, 'We don't want nobody nobody sent,' and that was my introduction to Chicago politics,"" Mikva recounted in an oral history recorded by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library.Mikva was elected to the Illinois state legislature in 1956 and served in the U.S. House during the 1960s and 1970s.In 1979, President Jimmy Carter nominated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where he became chief judge. One of his law clerks was Elena Kagan.Mikva remained on the bench until 1994, when he was appointed by Clinton as White House counsel.Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who worked on one of Mikva's congressional re-election campaigns, issued a statement calling him ""one of the great public servants of our time.""Mikva's death was confirmed by Mikva Challenge, a leadership program for Chicago youth, but it did not provide a cause of death.(Editing by Fiona Ortiz and Bill Trott)"

The momentary rise continued as Comey said that the FBI would pass the case along to the Department of Justice for a final decision, but the bureau would not recommend charges. Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal spotted the move:Paul Krugman said not-so-cryptically that this was simply investors saying that anything that decreases the chance that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump will win the general election is good news: Of course, there doesn’t need to be a clear reason for stock market movements — in fact, there often isn’t.

It's gonna be difficult. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump's campaign is launching a venture called the Trump Leadership Initiative fellowship program to ramp up its organization in key states. But at least one of the states where Trump is organizing could best be described as a long shot. In an email sent out by Donald J. Trump for President Inc., the campaign seeks volunteers and fellows based in California, with a seminar being held in Stanton on July 13. The email, passed along by a recipient to The Huffington Post, gives a clear indication that Trump is following through on his pledge to put traditionally Democratic states in play. Trump has said he would compete in California during the general election, though few people assumed he'd follow through on those plans owing to the state's long liberal drift and his own immense difficulties with Hispanic voters, who make up 28 percent of the state’s electorate. Republicans have criticized the idea, arguing that it would drain his campaign of resources that would be better spent in easier-to-win states.Trump, apparently, believes he can play in the Golden State. The fellows program, the email reads, will be ""the backbone of the Trump strategy to launch the largest, earliest, and most diverse ground operation in California history.""Just what the TLI actually is, is not entirely clear. It is described as ""an extensive training workshop to equip Trump Fellows with the skills needed to work as professional field organizers."" Those fellows ""will be trained and experienced in grassroots organizing, field operations, cutting-edge campaign technology, messaging & communications, and engaging in voter contact.""The campaign did not return a request for further information, such as whether the fellows would be paid. But TLI appears to be the cousin of a similar effort launched by the RNC. A link in the Trump campaign email led to an Eventbrite page for individuals interested in working for Trump to sign up for the Stanton event. That page, however, listed the event as part of the Republican Leadership Initiative fellowship program -- an RNC initiative announced a few weeks back.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Every day or so, a handsome man who professes to be serious about finding a lasting relationship arrives by chopper -- AND boat, in case the helicopter wasn’t dramatic enough. Each woman has a chance to briefly meet the new suitor before deciding whether she’s interested in him. After he meets each one, he finds out which of the ladies are up for dating him, then picks two for an extended overnight date in an opulent villa. (So far, so Tinder.) The next night, he picks one to remain in a “couples” villa with him, at which point they begin working on developing a relationship. (If the couple doesn’t work out, the woman returns to the bungalows for another shot at meeting her dream man; the dude has to chopper right back home.)“I wanted every woman to have a chance, technically, to end up in a relationship,” Burnett told Allison P. Davis of The Ringer. “And nobody wants to see one man eliminating 12 women. That’s just not very 2016.” In Davis’ deep dive into the aspiring “Bachelor” competitor, she highlights the appeal of a dating show that, unlike “The Bachelor,” seems determined to foster a positive, woman-centric, racially diverse dynamic.The women and men featured on the season so far have been racially and even ideologically diverse -- there’s a very outspoken 23-year-old conservative radio personality in the bungalows. And since they’re not all competing for the same man, the contestants have a smoother path to forming firm friendships and expressing their true personalities, rather than being slotted into “angry black woman” or “blonde bimbo.”In “The Bachelor” world, women have careers and communities they are often willing to leave behind for love. Their political views, religious upbringings and social values are set aside entirely -- at least for viewers -- in favor of vague “connections.” And the ultimate goal is always a proposal, driving home that the highest level of success one can achieve is a heterosexual marriage. “Coupled” is still ultimately grounded in a world that privileges couplehood (see: the name of the show), but it takes a different approach. Disinterest in the options in front of you is an acknowledged option. Breakups happen and they aren’t necessarily because someone was there for “the wrong reasons.” And the contestants discuss their political and social worldviews, using those values to evaluate whether a person might be a good -- or terrible -- match for them. Crazy, right?As Davis points out, the bar is set so low for positive representation in the realm of reality dating shows, that “Coupled” gets points for “doing the bare minimum: i.e., casting people of color in a real capacity, as romantic leads, instead of just stunt-casting to silence critics.” (Plus, let’s be frank, all this girl-power energy and positive vibes don’t make for nearly as much can’t-look-away drama.) But it’s refreshing to see a show that jettisons some of the most irksome, offensive aspects of “The Bachelor,” which is, at this point, the grand old lady of reality dating.It may not quite be must-see TV -- after all, we still find ourselves waiting a day or two to watch the latest episode of “Coupled” on Hulu in a way we would never allow ourselves to fall behind on “The Bachelor” or “The Bachelorette” -- but it’s something. For more on “Coupled” -- and Lifetime’s “UnREAL” -- check out this week’s episode of HuffPost’s “Here to Make Friends,” a “Bachelor” recap show."
33,BUSINESS,Trump's Obsession With Chinese Currency Manipulation Is Sooo 2014,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-china-currency-manipulation_us_5775213de4b0cc0fa13692c4,"It's unclear whether that matters to voters who lost their jobs to Chinese exporters, though.",2016-07-05,It turns out that Donald Trump masks are a Chinese export.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5776b88b1800002500fa3984.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Donald Trump spoke about his economic policy ideas at an aluminum plant in Monessen, Pennsylvania, last week, he came out especially strong on currency manipulation by the Chinese, which was a thorny problem for American trade through much of the 2000s. The presumptive GOP nominee has raised this point time and time again, but the criticism is two years too late. While the country was almost certainly manipulating its currency for more than a decade, it's pretty clear by the way the yuan has fluctuated in recent months that China stopped about two years ago, Peterson Institute senior fellow Joseph Gagnon told The Huffington Post. While Gagnon agrees with Trump that the United States should have done more to call out China when this was going on, he said there's little question the manipulation stopped around 2014.The key thing to know about currency manipulation is that the value of any currency is always related to the value of another currency. Therefore, a government with access to a ton of resources can devalue its own currency by buying up a bunch of other countries' currencies.In the case of China, for many years it bought a ton of dollars and dollar-denominated assets, which drove down the price of the Chinese yuan relative to the dollar. Because the yuan was cheap compared to the dollar, this made it more attractive to buy something made in China than something made in America. While 2000s-era global trade was great for the Chinese economy and lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty, it came at the expense of American workers.When Chinese exports became a lot cheaper than American exports, obviously more people started to buy the Chinese exports. American manufacturing had an even tougher time competing than it already was having. Factories closed and people lost their jobs. While the decline of American manufacturing has never been entirely a story of currency manipulation — globalization is complicated, and factory workers throughout Asia are still much cheaper than anywhere in America's Rust Belt — it certainly didn't help. Until recently, even economists didn't realize exactly how bad the problem was.Basic economics suggests that when people lose their manufacturing jobs, they'll eventually find new ones elsewhere. But recent scholarship on the effects of trade liberalization suggests it is much more complicated than that. Years after losing manufacturing jobs, American workers in places hit the hardest by outsourcing are still seeing low wages and high unemployment. Thus, even if railing against Chinese currency manipulation is technically out of date, it might not matter, because its effects are still being felt by the voters that Trump is courting. And they may feel like someone is finally listening.""The voters that were on the front lines of China dislocation were ahead of Washington,"" said Jennifer Harris, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""A lot of it had to do with currency in China before Washington really caught up.""

The dog, dubbed “Freeway Frida” by the media, fell from a pickup truck barreling down the highway on April 10. The pup dodged death along the busy freeway for five weeks before Coelho, and two other officers, were able to wrangle her on May 14. Coelho has been regularly checking up on Frida as she’s undergone numerous surgeries and intensive treatment at VCA Bradshaw Animal Hospital in Elk Grove for a broken hind leg and infected bone.During her Frida’s time in the hospital, Coelho developed a deep bond with the pup she helped rescue and since Frida’s original family has not come forward to claim her, Coelho was happy to take her home on June 30.“I’ve got her bed, her toys, her treats,” Coelho told The Fresno Bee. “I’m so excited!”Frida’s new forever family also includes Coelho’s husband, Rick, a Chihuahua named Valerie and three cats, Harley, Marley and Midnight.Coelho calls the latest addition to her brood ""baby girl"" but originally, she called her “ghost dog” — due to the fact despite numerous calls about seeing glimpses of the dog, Coelho had a difficult time pinning down the pooch. But when Coelho got a call about the dog while she was on duty on a Saturday, a day she usually does not work, she felt it had to be a sign.“I’m like, ‘OK. We’re going to find this dog,’” Coelho told the LA Times. “I never work weekends. It was meant for me to work that Saturday.”Her hunch was right and Coelho was able to capture a then emaciated, 44-pound Frida that day.“She fights, she bites. We’re saying, ‘It’s all right, it’s all right,’” Coelho told the LA Times. “And those big brown eyes just staring up at me … She didn’t fight us after that at all.”It’s a mystery as to how Frida survived that long without food or water next to a busy highway, but Frida’s veterinarian, Mike Johnson, guesses she ate garbage. Though, he’s unsure where she found water.But, from now on, Frida will get all the food, water and love she needs.""She's going to go from the freeway to being here -- to a loving home,” Coehlo told KGRA. “I'm so happy to give that to her."""

37,BUSINESS,Elon Musk Is Feuding With Yet Another Person Who Dared Criticize Tesla,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-fortune_us_577bc4b0e4b041646410a3c0,"This time it's a financial journalist who asked about the deadly ""Autopilot"" crash.",2016-07-05,Tesla's stock price plummeted on Tuesday following news two days earlier that the company missed its second-quarter delivery target.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577bcfc11500002a006c9a13.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Elon Musk is once again feuding publicly with a reporter who said something he didn't like.The Tesla chief on Monday criticized a veteran financial journalist at Fortune magazine for implying that his electric automaker acted unethically by taking two months to publicly disclose a deadly crash in one of its semi-autonomous cars.Just 11 days after the May 7 crash -- in which a Tesla driver died while reportedly watching a movie while using his Model S sedan's ""Autopilot"" function on a Florida highway -- Tesla sold more than $2 billion of stock at a price of $215 per share. ""To put things baldly, Tesla and Musk did not disclose the very material fact that a man had died while using an auto-pilot technology that Tesla had marketed vigorously as safe and important to its customers,"" Carol J. Loomis, a former senior editor-at-large who spent 60 years at the venerable financial glossy, wrote in a story published Tuesday morning.After emailing back and forth with Tesla public relations managers, she said Musk joined the thread.Elon Musk himself suddenly entered the email conversation. He first thought, mistakenly, that Fortune was criticizing the price at which Tesla and he had sold stock. This writer replied that was not the case and that the issue was the non-disclosure of a material fact. That, Musk replied in a second e-mail, “is not material to the value of Tesla.”Musk pointed to the fact that the stock price actually rose on Friday, after Tesla made public the news of the crash -- and a federal investigation into it -- in a blog post the night before.Fortune did not responded to a request for further comment. Musk did, however, respond to Fortune editor Alan Murray on Twitter:In an email, a Tesla spokeswoman told The Huffington Post: ""Elon's comments are the comment."" The timing couldn't be worse for Tesla. The company on Sunday reported that it missed its delivery target for the second quarter of the year. The announcement came just weeks after Tesla made a bid to buy solar energy firm SolarCity, a deal Wall Street so far seems to hate.It's not the first time Musk has publicly criticized a reporter, a move that sometimes courts negative coverage and heightened skepticism.But Musk isn't like other chief executives. He embraces his celebrity. He speaks off the cuff to reporters about topics that seem straight out of a sci-fi novel, affording him John Oliver-esque amounts of headlines on the internet. He seems to believe that he has made himself a force for good in the world by bringing affordable electric cars and solar energy to market just as climate change begins to reach crisis levels.In February 2013, Musk launched a scorched-earth rebuttal against a New York Times reviewer whose Model S ran out of battery on a journey up the East Coast. The reporter, John M. Broder, failed to abide by Tesla's speed guidelines for long-haul journeys, according to data collected by the company. The newspaper's public editor at the time admitted Broder did not ""use good judgment along the way."" After last year's publication of Ashlee Vance's landmark Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future -- the most definitive biography of the billionaire yet -- Musk, a prolific tweeter, called one of the book's most shocking anecdotes ""total BS."" Musk is reportedly not speaking to Vance, a top writer at Bloomberg Businessweek, anymore. This post has been updated with a comment from Tesla."

The actor said that wasn't the case, but he elaborated on why he took the role of the Rangers' mentor -- and it has a lot to do with another reimagined movie franchise. ""At first I was, to be honest with you, I was reticent to looking at the role because I remember the television series was kind of farcical and silly and 'pow' and 'zow' -- weird movements and things like that. I was like, 'Oh, OK,'"" said the actor, who used to do voice work on the ""Power Rangers” TV show.""I wasn't really high on it until I talked to the producer and read the script and talked to the director. After that I went, 'This is different.'"" He continued, ""This is as different a reimagining as the 'Batman' television series as it became the 'Batman' movie series. You can't compare those two, and nor can you compare this movie version of the 'Power Rangers' to that television series. It's unrecognizable for the most part. There are tenets of the folklore that you hold onto for sure, but the inspiration is different, and the sensibility of it, and the approach to the film making is completely different.""When asked to clarify that the ""Batman"" movies he was referring to were from the ""Dark Knight” series, Cranston confirmed ""Yeah,” but he added, ""I don't know if the tone is as dark as that because you're dealing with teenagers. So the appropriateness of that, and real teenage life, and going through high school and the cliques and the popularity or lack thereof, and the bullies and all the different sections and sub-sections of high school life, and the insecurities of these kids and things like that -- hopes and dreams -- and you embrace all of that into a retelling of the 'Power Rangers.' And what you would get is this new version, this new reimagined version.""As a fan of the old TV show, we merely adopted the ""Power Rangers."" Cranston was born in it, molded by it. (The Blue Ranger is named for him, after all.) So if Zordon is saying this is a ""Dark Knight"" -like change, there's only one response:""The Infiltrator"" hits theaters July 13."
39,POLITICS,FBI Director On Clinton's Email: 'No Charges Are Appropriate In This Case',Ryan J.

""There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" Comey said of Clinton and her colleagues. But he said he would recommend to the DOJ that ""no charges are appropriate in this case.""Comey said the FBI reviewed the approximately 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department in 2014. If an email appeared to contain classified information, the bureau consulted any government agency that ""was a likely 'owner'"" of the information to determine if it was classified at the time it was transmitted or if it would be considered classified today.The FBI found that 110 emails in 52 email chains contained classified material. ""Eight of those chains contained information that was top secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained secret information at the time; and eight contained confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification,"" Comey said. He also said it was ""possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.""Comey noted that while a single server was mentioned during the outset of the investigation, ""it turns out to have been more complicated than that.""""Secretary Clinton used several different servers and administrators of those servers during her four years at the State Department, and used numerous mobile devices to view and send email on that personal domain,"" Comey said.Piecing together information from multiple servers and equipment “has been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands of hours of effort,” he said.The FBI found evidence that the security culture at the State Department was ""generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government,” Comey said, though he noted that was not the focus of the investigation.Giving an example of the “careless” handling of sensitive information, Comey pointed to email chains that contained information that was considered “top secret/special access program level” at the time they were sent or received.“There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,” he said.Comey said that the FBI could not find a case in the past that would support bringing criminal charges based upon the facts. The bureau did not find clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information or vast quantities of material, or indications of disloyalty to the U.S. or efforts to obstruct justice.""To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences,"" Comey said. ""To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.""Comey said that only the facts mattered to the bureau, and the FBI found the facts in ""an entirely apolitical and professional way."" He said he wanted to reassure the public that the investigation was done ""competently, honestly and independently"" and that ""no outside influence of any kind was brought to bear.""The FBI announcement came days after Clinton met with investigators at the bureau's headquarters in Washington. That was seen as a signal that the federal investigation could be winding down. Attorney General Loretta Lynch -- facing criticism over her meeting with former President Bill Clinton -- said Friday she would accept the recommendation of career prosecutors on the matter. Hillary Clinton's press secretary said Tuesday that the campaign was satisfied with the outcome of the investigation.""We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate,"" Brian Fallon said in a statement. ""As the Secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved.""Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said the FBI announcement showed that the ""system is rigged.""Clinton has called the use of a private email server a mistake, but has said she didn't break any laws.
