Some Peruvians have found the perfect sublimation strategy. It’s called Takanakuy, and it involves knocking out your nearest and dearest on Christmas Day. Every December 25, hundreds of indigenous Andean citizens of the Chumbivilcas Province, near Cuzco, celebrate by wrapping their fists in tissue and duking it out, gladiator style, with friends and relatives. It’s not just passive aggression. Some use Takanakuy to settle serious personal or legal disputes. Your best friend stole your girlfriend? Wait for Takanakuy. Your neighbor built on your property? Wait for Takanakuy. The rules are simple: Whoever wins, wins the case. “It’s only slightly violent,” says Milagros Flores Chino, a regular participant who lives in Cuzco. Takanakuy — which in Quechua means “when the blood is boiling” — started centuries ago in the city of Santo Tomas, according to one of the festival organizers. Lore has it that the community was so utterly isolated that the citizens had to come up with their own system for effectively settling thorny legal disputes. Punching matches seemed to provide efficient justice, and ease social tensions, besides.But don’t assume that means Takanakuy is no-holds-barred. Biting or kicking someone when he’s down is forbidden, and there are referee-type figures equipped with colorful whips ready to separate fighters if one of them violates the rules. They’ve also added police who stand by in case things get too out of hand.Today, many amateur boxers join Takanakuy for the fun. And it’s not only young men. Women, elders and even children — with parental approval — can go at each other while hundreds of spectators stand by watching, laughing and cheering. On top of the kicking and punching, the festival is surprisingly joyous, with music, dance and copious amounts of alcohol. Everybody dresses up for the occasion in a peculiar style that combines traditional belts, colorful ski masks and even stuffed animals as hats. No wonder the practice has become so popular it’s now spreading to larger cities like Cuzco and even Lima.Feel like giving it a try to clear the air before the new year? Watch this video for tips.

1,HEALTHY LIVING,Why Having a Happy Vegan Holiday Matters,"Dylan Kendall, ContributorDesigner of social ideas and social objects www.dylankendall.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-having-a-happy-vegan-_b_6304886.html,"Using the word ""vegan"" doesn't mean pulling out your Grateful Dead shirt from decades ago or growing your own soybeans.

With every email that ends ""Have a Happy Holiday!"" I'm reminded that during the rest of the year we often let the busy-ness of our lives overtake our sense of humanity and kindness.At the end of the year we change: Charities report higher donations, we remember the family member or friend we haven't spoken to all year, and we take the time to smile at strangers. This year I would like us to consider extending that kindness to all creatures -- those we share our couches with and those we share the planet with -- and to make some decisions that may help our planet be a little more green for generations to come. Using the word ""vegan"" doesn't mean pulling out your Grateful Dead shirt from decades ago or growing your own soybeans. Using the word vegan means considering your food and your lifestyle options and looking for the kindest choices. Vegan means being kind, and if vegan means being kind you can see why thinking vegan during the holidays is even more important.Where to start?Food is our first consideration when we want to make kinder choices. There are so many easy ways to substitute plant-based ingredients for animal ones that finding tasty alternatives to your favorite holiday treats has never been easier! A few ideas: Love your baked goods? One of the easiest and most healthy substitutes you can make is to use flaxseed in place of eggs. Vegan Baking has a great article on why flax makes a dynamic egg alternative and how to use it. By choosing flax, you are making a kinder choice for the planet. Industrial egg farming burdens the planet. You are also extending kindness to others including the highly-sociable chicken who spends her life crammed into a tiny cage. But as importantly, you are also making a healthier choice for yourself as flax seed is considered by some to be one of the most powerful plant foods on the planet, helping reduce the risk of stroke, cancer and diabetes.  Love chocolate? Go dark! Let the cows hang on to their milk for their babies and do yourself a heart healthy turn by getting your chocolate fix on with dark chocolate. Where else might you make a kinder decision? In your own DIY arts and crafts box. Did you know that some felts are still made with wool? There is nothing kind about wool. In the old days farmers would pluck any extra wool from their sheep during the molting season. With the invention of shears, sheep farms have become over-crowded camps of animals modified to produce more wool. The real version of those cute little cotton ball sheep we used to make out of toilet paper rolls are now exposed to painful mulesing. Why not wool-free holiday decorations!? How about felt stockings made out of 100 percent post-consumer recycled and BPA-free plastic bottles? I'll bet you'll find plenty of candy canes to put in these re-used water bottles! And remember to extend kindness to your own furry friends! One of the easiest decisions you can make and show Mittens that you want the planet to be around forever is to shower her with gifts made from recycled materials. Old socks make great cat toys, as Melissa Boyle shows us in her ETSY store, Marvelous Melissa .  And Molly Mutt has done a terrific design job of making cotton bed covers we can fill with our old T-shirts to create the most comfortable bed a feline or canine friend could want. Having a happy vegan holiday doesn't mean eating raw carrots and juicing kale. Having a happy vegan holiday means extending the kindness we feel for each other during this season to all living creatures as well as the planet earth, ensuring that future generations will enjoy their own happy holidays for many more years to come!"

My classes also had the obligatory reading of Peggy McIntosh’s “White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack” so we could prove we were intersectional. I could sling opaque, academic prose and decry sexist, orientalist portrayals of characters in pop culture with the best of them.But what I didn’t learn was how to use the tools of argument to deconstruct and call out the derailing tactics of our world outside the university bubble -- hell, I didn’t even know about the term “derailing” until about a year ago.

In fact, it's expected to be 10 degrees and sunny this afternoon.  The great thing about Switzerland though, is that looking out my window I see the Alps across the lake and their peaks are snow-covered -- it's magical and very Christmassy despite the warm weather down here.I have, as usual, woken up earlier than everyone else, and am sitting at my kitchen table with only one small light on, the sky is still dark outside. I love the morning silence. Jesse is out with friends, he didn't come home last night. I just sent him a message asking where he is, but the odds are low that he'll reply this early in the morning. I sent my message anyway -- it's a bit like fishing, I've got my line out there and he'll bite at some point. The key is patience.Daniel is at his dad's, in Canada. They have snow there, and will have a turkey or two over the next few days as they visit all the family members. I won't make a turkey here, I am becoming more ""Swissified"" all the time, and we opted for a meat fondue cooked in wine as our traditional Christmas meal. I did make turkey for Thanksgiving, and let me tell you something -- the Swiss have something going here with the meat fondue idea. It is SO easy. Practically no preparation -- you can buy the meat already cut up, the dipping sauces premade. Just heat up the broth and place the whole thing on the table for everyone to cook their own meat in the simmering fondue pot. Cleaning up involves one pot, which just had liquid -- now is that easy or what? And to top it off, it's delicious.We're also going to make a traditional Danish meal on the 24th. Duck, hasselback potatoes and a salad of sliced oranges, almonds and cinnamon.Since we worked every day for the last week, do you think we had time to do any grocery shopping? Uh, no. So today, in a few moments, I will have to head out into the madness to buy all the things we need for these meals. And maybe pick up a few last minute stocking stuffers too.I love the combination of traditions, and there is no time when the differences are more evident than at Christmas. For our family, it's a matter of blending three cultures into one event. In Danish tradition, Santa Claus (Julemand) shows up at the door at some point during the evening of the 24th. The kids all run around like crazy, the smaller ones terrified of course, the older ones muttering, ""Hey wait a minute that looks like uncle..."" while the parents hush them and take them aside for a ""talk."" Julemand lives at the North Pole, which of course is in Denmark (Greenland, to be precise). He has a bag with a few small gifts, one for each child. The parents invite him in for a drink of Christmas beer and sometimes he actually does come in, because he apparently has lots of time.In Switzerland, Santa Claus comes on December 6th. Yes, you read me right. Saint Nicholas day is the traditional day when the Père Noël, in French, or Samichlaus, in Swiss German, shows up. He lives at the North Pole, which of course is in Finland. Often there is a village festival on December 6th, and at some point Samichlaus will come to your door and leave small gifts, oranges and chocolate in your shoe. It's important to have big shoes in Switzerland. By the way, there's a bad guy who hangs around with Santa called le Père Fouettard, or Schmutzli in Swiss German, who has a dirt smudged face and brown robes, and also carries a bag. He's there to either whip or just simply kidnap the bad kids. Bizarrely, the police seem ok with all this. Often, Schmutzli has a donkey that carries the bag. I guess those big footed kids get heavy.In Europe, or Western Europe at least, if you ask someone when Christmas is, they will say the 24th of December. In North America it's the 25th. It's all very confusing. I have to admit, while we North Americans are being forced out of our bed in the wee morning hours of the 25th by kids who want to open their presents, the Swiss are sleeping soundly -- their kids all opened their presents the night before, and were allowed to stay up as late as they wanted. This is Swiss cleverness at its best. Seriously, what are we thinking in America? We desperately try to get the kids to fall asleep on the 24th even though they are way too full of excitement and candy, then we typically stay up late having some drinks until we are ready for bed, which is roughly when we realize we haven't wrapped all the gifts from Santa yet, then we spend the next hour exhaustingly wrapping things, sometimes running out of scotch tape (bandaids work in a pinch by the way). We crawl exhausted into bed at 1:00 a.m. and open our eyes at 6:00 a.m. (if we're lucky) to see a small face and big eyes staring right up close to our face, and a small voice whispering ""she's awake!""We roll out of bed, grab the camera, and growl grumpily, ""No one do anything till I get a coffee!"" The kids hop around excitedly grabbing and shaking packages and once we are settled on the couch the mad tearing open of wrapping paper can begin. To be fair, there is something magical about that moment. The combination of fatigue and coffee induced edginess heightens your senses and everything seems more exciting. Then there's the inevitable post-gift madness trauma. You know, that point where you realize you don't have batteries, you don't have the tiny screw driver required to open the battery compartment, you don't have the special pen that is not included in the magic toy, or your 5-year-old excitedly holds up the huge box of playmobil and asks you to ""help"" put it together. All of this happens before 8:00 a.m. generally.The Swiss are still sleeping.You are on your seventh coffee.You decide it's time for breakfast and head to the kitchen to whip up the easy morning breakfast casserole recipe you found in a magazine. This takes you two hours instead of 20 minutes, for reasons that are still being studied by the scientific community. Perhaps you are just moving slowly, like a movie being played in slow motion.By the time breakfast is ready your children have eaten 24 pieces of chocolate, 17 candy canes and five cookies. You serve your wonderful casserole which is slightly burnt but bizarrely undercooked in the center, and the kids have one bite each then say they are full. Your husband dutifully eats his entire portion with a big smile plastered in his face, and you realize it's moments like these, when he's willing to pretend your food is amazing, that you know why you love him.By 11:00 a.m., the Swiss are getting up and quickly making an espresso in their tiny tiny cups, which they drink in under two seconds. Their kids may have been up for a while, but, and here's the cleverest part, they kept themselves busy playing with the new toys they got last night. Ah but all of that is still ahead of me, as I write this on the morning of the 24th. We're going to try a combination of traditions this time: the kids will open most presents tonight, and Santa Claus will leave a few smaller gifts which can be opened tomorrow morning. I am not, I repeat, not, making a breakfast casserole. I will not be swayed by anything I read in a magazine today. I'll let you know how it goes."
6,CRIME,"Police Officer Who Killed Black Teen In Missouri Had Been Issued Body Camera, Wasn't Using It",Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/antonio-martin-body-camera_n_6377626.html,,2014-12-24,"NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 03: New York Police Department (NYPD) Officer Joshua Jones demonstrates how to use and operate a body camera during a press conference on December 3, 2014 in New York City. The NYPD is beginning a trial exploring the use of body cameras; starting Friday NYPD officers in three different precincts will begin wearing body cameras during their patrols. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2aec61f000051002267fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Berkeley, Missouri, police officer who fatally shot a black teenager on Tuesday was issued a body camera earlier that night, but wasn't wearing it at the time of the shooting. The dashboard camera in his police cruiser also was not activated.On Wednesday, St. Louis County Chief of Police Jon Belmar said that the officer -- who is still unnamed, but was described as a white 34-year-old and six-year veteran of the police force -- was responding to reports of a theft at a Mobil station when he confronted 18-year-old Antonio Martin and another person. Belmar said Martin ""produced a pistol with his arm straight out, pointing at the officer,"" at which point the officer responded by firing three shots at Martin, striking him once and killing him. The person with Martin then fled.Surveillance footage from the Mobil station has been released, and appears to show a person in the background -- said to be Martin -- raising his arm in the direction of a police cruiser and officer. The camera seems to be too far away from the incident, however, for anything to be to determined conclusively from the video.Video captured by a body camera or dashboard camera likely would have been able to reveal more details about the incident. Belmar said the car's dashboard camera wasn't activated because the cruiser's emergency lights hadn't been turned on at the time, which would have automatically triggered the recording.At a later press conference on Wednesday, Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said he wasn't concerned that the officer hadn't turned on his body camera. He noted that the equipment is new for the town's police department and that officers haven't received full training yet.""In the future and when we get well trained, there will be a severe penalty for an officer who does not turn [their body camera] on,"" Hoskins said.Body cameras are frequently cited as a key way to bring transparency to interactions between law enforcement and civilians, especially in the wake of the police killings of Michael Brown and other unarmed individuals who died in encounters that weren't recorded. One frequently cited pilot program in Rialto, California, found that between 2012 and 2013, in the first year of the city using police cameras, the number of complaints filed against officers fell by 88 percent and use of force by officers fell by almost 60 percent.While President Barack Obama has joined the call for the implementation of body cameras with the announcement of a $75 million grant for the equipment, the limitations of the devices have already been exposed. In the case of Eric Garner, for example, there was video of the confrontation that led to his death, and yet a grand jury declined to indict the police officer who put him in an illegal chokehold.In addition -- as the Police Executive Research Forum presented to the Department of Justice in a 2014 report -- there are still plenty of concerns from both the law enforcement and civil rights communities about how, exactly, a large-scale police camera program would be implemented. Which interactions, for example, would be recorded? How would the review process work? What would the penalties be for failing to record an interaction? Such questions are further complicated by state laws that differ on when and where people may be recorded, as well as how such recordings may be stored and accessed by the public. And while these questions might be addressed as more police departments adopt such programs, the Berkeley shooting reminds us of a simpler truth: A camera is useless if it's not recording."

Currently, more than half of the world's middle class population can be found in the Western world. However, recent reports and studies have consistently shown that the global share of the middle class is shifting. Global Forecast: Emerging Middle ClassThe New York Times reported earlier this year that the worldwide dominance of the American middle class has come to an end. A recent report released by Deloitte revealed that there has been significant economic growth in Africa due to an emerging middle class and increasing consumer demand, so much so that the continent's gross domestic product (GDP) could grow by 50 percent to $3.7 trillion by 2019.In addition, the Asian middle class currently stands at 500 million and will explode to 1.75 billion by 2020 - more than a threefold increase in just seven years. Over the next two decades, Asian emerging markets are expected to lead the way in middle class expansion, possibly the biggest seismic shift in history. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Asia-Pacific region will eclipse all others in terms of middle class growth, moving from 28 percent of the world's middle class in 2009 to 54 percent in 2020 and 66 percent by 2030. Ernst and Young has estimated the middle class will add another 3 billion people to its ranks, almost entirely from emerging markets. Nearly half of this anticipated growth will come from China and India alone - China is expected to have one billion among its middle class, while India will have approximately 500 million.As impressive as these numbers may sound, they don't tell the whole story. On the surface, Africa appears to remain stagnant within this context, but this couldn't be farther from the truth. The McKinsey Global Institute found that Africa's collective GDP was $1.6 trillion in 2008, roughly equal to that of Brazil or Russia. In addition, its combined consumer spending that year was $860 billion, and it is home to 20 companies with revenues of $3 billion or more. By 2020, Africa is expected to have a collective GDP of $2.6 trillion, $1.4 trillion in consumer spending, and 128 million households with discretionary income. Putting this all into perspective, although Africa's global share of the middle class is expected to remain the same and relatively low over the next two decades, this does not mean that the continent will not experience significant and considerable growth.Not to be overlooked, Latin America is another region that is expected to experience substantial growth in the coming years. Americas Market Intelligence projected that Latin America's GDP will nearly double from $5.9 trillion in 2012 to $10.4 trillion by 2020, and the World Bank predicted that the rate of poverty in the region will plummet from 5.4 percent in 2008 to 3.1 percent. The World Bank also expects that the middle class will make up 43 percent of the Latin American population by 2030, twice as high as in 2005.Limited Access to Financial Services While all of these projected figures seem encouraging, there is an important aspect to consider. In these emerging markets, access to and use of financial services are among the lowest levels anywhere in the world. For example, data from the World Bank reveals that the average rate of African adults with financial institution accounts is only 30 percent, 35 percent in Asia Pacific, and 39 percent in Latin America. Compared with 97 percent for the UK, 96 percent for Canada, and 88 percent for the US, you can clearly see how the present lack of financial services and education leaves the majority of Africans, Asians, and Latin Americans at a great disadvantage when it comes to participating in and benefiting from the global economy.For this group, conveniences that we take for granted such as government-issued IDs and documentation, access to online banking, online payment infrastructures, direct deposit of wages, and government benefits are beyond their reach. Imagine how your life would be if you had to walk for hours every day to turn on the water or electricity. Such is the reality for many in emerging markets.Digital Pathways to Financial Inclusion Technology and innovation play a huge part in advancing financial inclusion. In Africa today, there are 167 million Internet users (16 percent reach), 67 million smartphones, and $18 billion Internet contribution to GDP. By 2025, it is expected that there will be 600 million Internet users (50 percent reach), 360 million smartphones, and $300 billion Internet contribution to GDP. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has created a Financial Services for the Poor initiative that aims to use technology to accelerate the rate at which people can transition out of poverty and build their financial security. The foundation works with countries such as Bangladesh, Nigeria, Kenya, and India, in some of the regions that are expected to experience explosive growth in their middle class populations. In addition to providing access to technology, organizations such as the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) also play a vital role by working closely with policy makers, financial service providers, and funders like the Gates Foundation to develop innovative and practical solutions.Is it enough to simply provide this group with mobile phones and the opportunity to sign up for mobile bank accounts? This will certainly go a long way toward allowing them greater participation in their domestic economy, but let's not forget about the part that donors and investors, such as microfinance companies and private sector firms, can play when it comes to financial inclusion. They can provide funds and resources and partner with groups like CGAP to build the necessary education and outreach programs that will equip the unbanked with the knowledge and the confidence to actively use their new accounts and become active players in their own national economy. In addition, providing microcredit has been successful in helping many in emerging markets become financially self-sufficient.Verified Identities Opens Door for New Opportunities According to Trulioo's Founder and CEO, Stephen Ufford, ""consumers from emerging markets do not have access to the world's financial services mostly due to a lack of a digital information from banks, telcos, utilities and the government about them in the system. A trust relationship cannot be formed with financial institutions because in the US and Europe these companies are used to relying on this type of data to verify a customer's identity at the onset.; this does not work for people that have no such digital footprint.""He proposes CyberID data (CID) which includes alternative identity information from online sources such as social networks, mobile applications, and ecommerce sites can be used in place of traditional sources to establish trust. ""Financial inclusion through access to banking services is one part of the equation to eliminating poverty, but we first have to take the next logical step and help those without access today to create a digital footprint that they can use to become full participants in the global marketplace tomorrow,"" says Ufford.What do you see as the biggest challenges to overcome when it comes to eliminating global poverty and fostering greater financial inclusion?"
8,POLITICS,Here's The Part Of Alan Gross' Story That Obama Hasn't Been Talking About,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alan-gross-cuba_n_6377774.html,,2014-12-24,"WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 17: Alan Gross, accompanied by his wife Judy, speaks to reporters during a press conference at the law offices of Gilbert LLP in Washington, D.C., December 17, 2014. Gross recently returned home to the United States after spending five years in a Cuban prison. (Photo by Astrid Riecken For The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e2243c000066000dfcc0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org.In accounts from both sides of the aisle, recently-freed Alan Gross has been portrayed as a humanitarian simply trying to bring Internet access to Cuba’s small Jewish community. But there’s more to the story than that shorthand suggests.Although Gross entered Cuba on a handful of occasions on a tourist visa and purported to be a member of a Jewish humanitarian group, Gross was actually doing work as a subcontractor for a pro-democracy program funded by the U.S. government, work for which Gross was being paid about a half million dollars. Reporting by the Associated Press revealed that Gross was covertly bringing in technology known to be illegal in Cuba — equipment such as satellite phones and a chip that allows Internet use without detection. Reports obtained by the AP also revealed that Gross knew what he was doing was “very risky business” and that detection of the equipment would be “catastrophic.”For those unfamiliar with the full story, comments by Sen. Marco Rubio and President Barack Obama might suggest a purely innocuous purpose to Gross’ mission.On the day he announced a restoring of diplomatic relations with Cuba, Obama told a group at a Hanukkah Reception: “Five years ago, [Gross] was arrested by Cuban authorities simply for helping ordinary Cubans, including Cuba’s small Jewish community, access information on the Internet.”On Fox News the same day, Dec. 17, Rubio called Gross “a hostage” who “did nothing wrong.” Rubio said Gross “was taken hostage because he was helping the Jewish community in Cuba have access to the Internet.”Gross was in Cuba to try to help the Jewish community gain unfettered Internet access. That’s correct. But the characterization of Gross as “simply” carrying out a humanitarian cause leaves out the subversive intent of Gross’ mission.Citing trip reports that he obtained, AP reporter Desmond Butler wrote in 2012 that Gross — working under a contract for the U.S. Agency for International Development — smuggled into Cuba an array of communication technology including laptops, smartphones, satellite phones and a mobile phone chip that makes it impossible to track where a call is coming from. Sources in the intelligence community told Butler the chip was “not available on the open market and is distributed only to governments.” The idea was to allow those in the Jewish community to have unfettered access to the Internet. But it was also serving USAID’s larger goal of promoting democracy in the communist state.A 2013 GAO report says, “Since 1996, Congress has appropriated $205 million to USAID and State to support democracy assistance for Cuba. Because of Cuban government restrictions, conditions in Cuba pose security risks to the implementing partners — primarily NGOs — and subpartners that provide U.S. assistance.” (The report – which is a declassified version — says that the $205 million is from FY1996 through FY2011.)The GAO report also says, “Cuban law prohibits citizens from cooperating with U.S. democracy assistance activities.”Gross’ company, JDBC Inc., was hired by Development Alternatives Inc. of Bethesda, Md., which the AP notes had a multimillion dollar contract with USAID “to break Cuba’s information blockade by ‘technological outreach through phone banks, satellite Internet and cell phones.’ ” Cuban authorities tightly restrict use of the Internet. On his fifth trip to Cuba, Gross was arrested by Cuban authorities, and in 2011 a Cuban court found Gross guilty of “acts against the independence or territorial integrity of the state.” He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.Cuban officials consider USAID activity in Cuba to be illegal. Gross claimed he didn’t know that, and that he thought only the users of the equipment in Cuba might be in legal peril.“After my arrest, I was informed by Cuban Government officials that it was illegal in Cuba to distribute anything funded in whole or in part by USAID,” Gross said in an affidavit. “At no point before or during the … Project was I aware or warned that activities contemplated by this USAID and [Development Alternatives Inc.]-sponsored project were crimes in Cuba.”At his trial in Cuba, Gross called himself a “trusting fool,” and Gross later filed a lawsuit against DAI and USAID. In the lawsuit, Gross claims USAID and DAI “failed to disclose adequately to Mr. Gross the superior knowledge that they had, or should have had, about the material risks that Mr. Gross faced due to his participation in the referenced project.”Gross also contends that they failed to provide him with “the education and training that was necessary to minimize the risk of harm to him, and failing to call him back from Cuba and/or preclude him from returning there.” DAI reached an undisclosed settlement with Gross. A federal judge dismissed the case against USAID, which Gross’ lawyers are appealing.While Gross claims he did not know his activities were illegal in Cuba, field reports obtained by the AP show that Gross was at least aware that his mission was risky.AP, Feb. 13, 2012: One report says a community leader “made it abundantly clear that we are all ‘playing with fire.’ ”Eric Hershberg, director of the Center for American and Latino Studies at American University, scoffed at the idea that Gross’ activities were limited to helping the Jewish community access the Internet. The chip brought into Cuba by Gross was “military level” technology, and was brought on behalf of a government group, USAID, that Hershberg said is committed to “promoting regime change” in Cuba.In a September 2009 report, Gross talked about the program as a “pilot” that could be “expanded to other identified target groups.”Richard Morris, a Spanish and linguistics professor at Middle Tennessee State University, told us via email, “Alan Gross was not arrested for introducing telecommunications technology to everyday Cubans, but rather for being ‘contracted to work for American intelligence services.’ ” The characterization in quotes comes from Cuban National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcón.Rubio’s account of Gross’ activities is “a much simpler explanation than admitting that Gross’ work was, by its nature, threatening to the state monopoly on information,” said Morris, who travels every year to Cuba with students.Although Cuban President Raul Castro called Gross a spy, U.S. officials insist he was not. For its part, USAID has defended its actions in Cuba — which included a controversial effort to set up a social media app for Cubans called ZunZuneo, a program the AP said was intended to stir unrest in Cuba.Responding to the AP’s story about ZunZuneo, a USAID spokesman released a statement saying, “USAID works in places where we are not always welcome. To minimize the risk to our staff and partners and ensure our work can proceed safely, we must take certain precautions and maintain a discreet profile. But discreet does not equal covert.”As Washington Post columnist Joe Davidson put it, “Gross was not a spy, and Cuba was wrong to treat him like one. But he also was not a naive do-gooder. His activities were at least semi-covert and he took efforts to conceal them.”"

11,LATINO VOICES,6 Reasons Having A Latino Pope Has Made A Difference,Ana Maria Benedetti,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/latino-pope_n_6374670.html,,2014-12-24,"VATICAN CITY, VATICAN - DECEMBER 22: (EDITORS NOTE: This images was processed using digital filters) Pope Francis exchanges Christmas greetings with the Roman Curia at the Clementina Hall on December 22, 2014 in Vatican City, Vatican. (Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a8e2424000086064f4f26.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ever since Pope Francis started his papacy in 2013 he has proved to be very different than his predecessors. The first Latino and first Jesuit pope has won over the world with his tendency to stray from tradition, his focus on humility and service and, most recently, his direct approach to calling out The Curia, the administrative body of the Roman Catholic Church, for their lack of introspection and committing ""terrorism of gossip,"" among other ailments.In less than two years the Argentine Pope's achievements are already piling up. Here are six reasons why having a Latino Pope has been awesome:1. He brokered re-opening of U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations After more than five decades of gridlock, Pope Francis helped the United States and Cuba resume diplomatic relations. It's not surprising that the first Latin American pope might play a role in softening the United States' tough foreign policy against Cuba. In Latin America, neither right-leaning nor left-wing governments view Cuba as a pariah. Countries across the region have pressed the U.S. to reestablish diplomatic relations and drop the trade embargo for years.2. He actually cares about poor peoplePope Francis' dedication to helping those in need has made him stand out among his predecessors. He focuses on the humility and service that are at the center of Christ's teachings. ""They don't understand that love for the poor is at the centre of the Gospel,"" he said to participants at the World Meeting of Popular Movements in October. ""Demanding this isn't unusual, it's the social doctrine of the church.""This dedication first caused some controversy in 2013 when he went against Vatican rules on Holy Thursday and washed the feet of two women and two Muslims at a juvenile detention center in Rome. Traditionally Popes would only wash priests' feet, according to CNN. The Pope then continued to set new standards by stepping out of the Vatican at night to meet with the poor and give them alms. This is something he did as a Cardinal in Argentina as well, making sure to break bread with the homeless and let them know they were loved.3. And immigrants Whether referring to African migrants traveling to Europe, child migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America, or everyday workers in search of a job beyond their borders, Pope Francis has urged the world to take a more sympathetic attitude toward immigrants. 4. He loves Mate and TangoLike a good Argentine, Pope Francis loves yerba mate and tango. The herbal infusion confused people at first, but it became a learning experience for people who don't know about the Southern Cone's popular culture. 5. He's a soccer fanLike most Argentines, Pope Francis is a big soccer fan and is dedicated to his favorite team, Argentina's Club San Lorenzo. When he met the team after they'd won the South American Copa Libertadores earlier this year, he said: ""I greet the San Lorenzo champions,"" according to The Telegraph. He acknowledged the club was part of his ""cultural identity.""The Argentine soccer club recently announced it would be naming its new stadium after the pope, who some have joked has helped the team out with some divine intervention. 6. He's the first Jesuit PopeIn his biography titled ""The Great Reformer"", Austen Ivereigh explains how the Holy See's politics were influenced by the first Jesuit missionaries to Latin America, who ""stood for a radical immersion in the life of the people,"" according to The New York Times.Pope Francis is not only the first Latino pope but also the first Jesuit pope. “Jesuits are educators known as the intellectuals of the church; they also have a long missionary tradition,” writes Jason Berry in the Daily Beast. This policy is certainly visible in the way the current Pope has approached his papacy. "
