During the fourth voyage, in 1502, in the Bay of Honduras, Columbus and the crew came upon a cocoa bean-laden canoe. They initially dismissed what they saw, confusing the beans with almonds. Columbus's son, Ferdinand, reported in his diary: ""Many of the almonds [cacao beans] which the Indians of New Spain use as currency; and these the Indians in the canoe valued greatly, for I noticed that when they were brought aboard with the other goods, and some fell to the floor, all the Indians stooped to pick them up as if they had lost something of great value.""Columbus and his crew soon learned that those mysterious-looking ""almonds"" in the bottom of the boat were used by the indigenous people of the Americas as coinage. For example, in 1513, Hernando de Oviedo y Valdez paid one hundred cocoa beans to purchase a slave. So valued were cocoa beans that counterfeiters were known to fill empty cocoa shells with clay or earth. In the New World, cacao was money and it grew on trees. Not surprisingly, when Columbus introduced the drab cocoa bean to the Spanish court, the royals focused instead on the valuable gold, silver, and other New World treasures. Only in 1544, when Dominicans tantalized the court with prepared chocolate presented by a Kekchi Maya delegation of New World natives, did it slowly gain popularity. From 1585 to 1630 Spain attempted to maintain a monopoly on cacao. Chocolate lover and priest Peter Martyr d'Anghera's (1457-1526) official chronicle of the New World, characterized chocolate among the luxuries at the court of Montezuma and described it ""as wine, a wonderful drink, fitte for a king.""Later the Spanish enjoyed the privilege of the exotic chocolate import when Seville welcomed its first significant chocolate cargo in 1591, though there had been smaller, private imports prior to that. These shipments of cacao ultimately achieved such renown that they voyaged with what was called the ""chocolate wind,"" or viento chocolatero, the name given in Mexico for the favorable northern breezes.We are beholden to Columbus' contact with the New World's chocolate resources for our chocolate addictions, including this New World Hot Chocolate.

Photo: F. Scott SchaferYou will not likely find anything funnier onstage, just now, than Nathan Lane in the opening scene of Terrence McNally's It's Only a Play. Lane, as a humble off-Broadway actor turned top-tier sitcom star, is given a barrage of robustly funny jokes to launch at us, mostly of the lacerating variety. What's more, he is given a straight man--a tall, young, Midwestern deer-in-the-headlights type played by a skilled newcomer named Micah Stock--who genially listens while clearly not understanding any of Lane's jokes. Not one. Lane tries harder and harder to get through, his brow furrows deeper and deeper, and things turn funnier, funnier, and desperately funnier. Fifteen minutes in, when you think the cascading laughter will never stop, the action begins and it does. Stop. Stockard Channing gamely hobbles on as a washed-up, drug-addicted ex-movie star. (The hobble is real; Channing is just back from three weeks of missed previews due to a knee injury, and gets through the evening with a cane--albeit she is careful to make it look like a mere prop.) She plays her role expertly, but her material is typical ""comic washed-up drug-addicted ex-movie star"" stuff, as opposed to the comic riffs playwright McNally has lavished on Lane. Then comes Rupert Grint (of the Harry Potter franchise) as a British directing genius with a mass of manias. He even crawls around at times under a black cloak, looking like a low-lying storm cloud drifting over the landscape. Grint eventually takes out a puppet version of himself and smacks it around--his dad didn't like him, you see--and displays quirks which are more quirky than funny. Equally unsuccessful is Megan Mullally as a dilettante producer with apparently no taste, no talent, and little sense. She does have a rich husband (offstage) and a ferocious dog (mostly offstage). Mullally drones through the evening in an airily vacant voice, making ditsy dilettante jokes. Mind you, laughs continue throughout the two-plus hours of this Jack O'Brien-directed opus; and good old Mr. Lane is omnipresent, always working to entertain us. (He is the odds-on favorite for this year's ""Best Featured Eyebrows"" Award.) Mr. McNally provides jolly stretches of hilarity, here and there, but most of the evening consists of a group of talented comic actors trying to inflate an often-flat farce. Some jokes land, some land big, and others just sit there. The nature of the piece is illustrated in the latter part of the first act by the appearance of two stage veterans. F. Murray Abraham--who initially came to prominence, before his Oscar-winning turn in Amadeus, in McNally's 1975 play The Ritz--turns up as drama critic Ira Drew. (While McNally's play drops names by the dozens--there are wicked jabs at Faye Dunaway, Liza, Barbra--his skewering of John Simon is so severe that he changes the name to protect the not-so-innocent.) Abraham crashes the opening night party of this play-within-a-play--and how many centuries have passed since theatre critics attended Broadway openings, wearing tuxedos?--and breathes some life back into the thing, laughing at his own jokes with a St. Vitus-like frenzy. (As an inside joke, I guess, they have given him a deliciously poor hairpiece which looks suspiciously like the piece worn by one of today's most successful Broadway composers.)The play builds to the entrance of Matthew Broderick, in full black tie & tails, as the author of the lousy new play at the center of the plot. We can easily believe, from the performance, that ""The Golden Egg"" is lame. Broderick's performance is restrained, I suppose you can say, but I'd place the blame on the material and leave it at that. Rupert Grint, F. Murray Abraham, Stockard Channing and Nathan Lane in It's Only a Play. Photo: Joan MarcusThe play is loosely based on the real-life friendship of McNally and the late James Coco, who became an overnight sensation as a middle-aged sad sack mistakenly called before the Vietnam draft board in McNally's 1969 one-act, Next. Coco immediately moved on, leaving within months to star in the new Neil Simon comedy (The Last of the Red Hot Lovers). McNally didn't hit it big until The Ritz, after which he wrote a play about a major star returning for the opening night of a play--which he had turned down--written by his former best friend. Coco himself played the role, opposite Geraldine Page as a dilettante producer (drawn apparently from The Ritz producer Adela Holzer, perhaps mixed with Gladys Rackmil). Broadway, Broadway was roughly rude but uproariously--and memorably--funny. Five days before the scheduled move into the Eugene O'Neill, the 22-year-old producer's father came to see it at the Forrest in Philadelphia and pulled the plug; not without reason, as Broadway audiences of 1978 were not used to profanity-laden inside joke-filled romps, but a pity as the thing was quite a treat. (Father and son were both named Edgar Bronfman.) Rewritten versions, under the title It's Only a Play, appeared off Broadway in 1982 and 1986, with a prominent revision in Los Angeles in 1992. While many of the celebrity names have now been updated for 2014, sections of the writing seem incongruously rooted in the 1970s.The Messrs. Lane and Broderick created a box office cataclysm when they joined together for The Producers in 2001. (The evolution of Broadway's ""premium seat"" prices can be traced directly to the demand to see the two comedians in that Mel Brooks epic.) They commanded an equally strong box office when they paired up for a revival of The Odd Couple in 2005, although the production itself was poorly received. It's Only a Play has already demonstrated similar appeal to premium ticket buyers, and will likely do exceptionally well during the limited engagement (through January 4.) Theatergoers will get their money's worth, if you can calculate worth by belly laffs, but it turns out that McNally's It's Only a Play is not all that much better than the play-within-a-play that the characters spend the night lamenting. ""It's Only Nathan Lane,"" though, is a boffo bonanza. .It's Only a Play, a play by Terrence McNally, opened October 9, 2014 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre"

The playoffs opened September 30 with the Wild Card Game in the American League where the Kansas City Royals showed up as the surprise guest and host. Over and over again came the reminders that the Royals had not been in post-season play since 1985 when they won the World Series. Now they faced the Oakland A's who managed to somehow get into the game after suffering a major collapse after the All-Star game. The A's acquired several front line pitchers to ensure their continued success and then forgot how to hit. Several players moved below the Mendoza line and the long ball vanished faster than you could say Yoenis Cespedes. As for the Royals they hadn't done much hitting all season long.So who would win this game that was certain to be dominated by two great starting pitchers? The low scoring affair turned out to be a 12 inning run-fest that ended when the A's took an 8-7 lead in the top of the 12th inning, only to watch KC get two runs in the bottom half to win 9-8. The Royals had 15 hits and seven stolen bases and no home runs.""In baseball youneverknow.""The next night in the National League Wild Card game another pitchers duel was predicted but only one pitcher dominated as the Giants beat the Pirates 8-0. ""In baseball youneverknow.""On Thursday the American League Divisional Series opened in Baltimore and Los Angles. In Baltimore the Orioles made their first appearance in the Divisional playoffs since 1997, having cruised to the end of the season clinching early. Meanwhile Detroit had to go to game 162 to clinch their spot atop the division and avoid the Wild Card Game. The Tigers arrived with three former Cy Young winners, and so naturally were swept three games to none. The Orioles scored 12 and 7 runs in Games 1 and 2, and finished the sweep with a 2-1 victory over Cy # Three, 2-1 on a two-run homer by Nelson Cruz. ""In baseball youneverknow.""Meanwhile in the other Divisional Championship the surprising Royals went off to Los Angeles to face the team with the best record in baseball, led by an array of big name hitters with home run power. KC was last in home runs in the league. The first game went eleven innings with the Royals winning on a home run by Mike Moustakas, the score, 3-2. The second game also went extra innings, 11 again, and again KC won on a home run, a three-run shot by Eric Hosmer. No team had ever started the playoffs by winning three extra inning games in a row. The Royals completed the sweep of the mighty Angels without extra innings. This time they scored 7 runs in the first four innings winning by a final score of 8-3. The Angels had one lead at the end of the top of the first inning, 1-0. Just to continue the theme the Royals hit two more home runs, Hosmer and Moustakus again, The team with the best record in the American League was gone. ""In baseball, youneverknow.""Perhaps there would be more sanity in the National League. Here the team with the biggest payroll, the Los Angles Dodgers, faced the weak hitting St. Louis Cardinals. The Dodgers had the hitting and the pitching with the consensus Cy Young award winner for this year, Clayton Kershaw. They also had the pitcher with the best winning percentage in the history of Dodger Stadium, Zack Greinke, not mention home field advantage.Kershaw looked like Kershaw in game one allowing only two runs in the first six innings and leading 6-2 going to the seventh. The Cardinals proceeded to spank him in the seventh with eight runs. There had been one warning shot fired in the 6th when Matt Carpenter hit a long home run off Kershaw. Carpenter added a three-run double in the 7th inning. The Dodgers added runs in the 8th and 9th innings to make the final score 10-9 in the battle of the two best pitchers on their respective teams.""In baseball youneverknow.""The next night order was restored with a 3-2 win for the Dodgers led by Greinke's pitching and Kemp's 8th inning game winning home run. Carpenter hit his second homer for the Cards. The series then moved to St. Louis where the Cards won game three with Carpenter hitting another home run while the game winner came in the 7th inning when Kolten Wong hit a two-run homer. Clayton Kershaw returned to the mound on short rest for game four. He was once again cruising through the first six innings, having not allowed a run and only one hit. Then came the seventh. The first two batters had scratch hits and then Matt Adams launched a three-run homer to give the Cards a lead that they did not relinquish. It was a 3-1 win and the Cardinals beat Kershaw twice, the same Kershaw who lost only three times the entire season. The Dodgers spent a lot of money to win, a record payroll for baseball. However, it is not how much you spend, but how you spend it that counts. This isn't the NBA, Mr. Johnson.""In baseball youneverknow.""As for the other National League series the Wild Card winner, San Francisco, took it to the team with the best record in the National League, the Washington Nationals. This series was the only one close to form, although the team with the best record lost three games to one and did so in a flurry of self-destruction. The winning run in the final game scored on a wild pitch, and that was followed by another wild pitch on an intentional walk with the runner from third trying to score and being cut down at the plate. So what lies ahead beginning Friday? As Joaquin Andujar would tell you, ""youneverknow."" After a lifetime of watching baseball I believe Andujar, and I also believe that in almost every game you will see something you have never seen before.

5,GREEN,How One Region Of China Is Trading Coal Mining For Winemaking,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/coal-region-china-wine_n_5963482.html,,2014-10-10,"A wine judge tastes a selected Ningxia wine at a large tasting event in Beijing on September 25, 2014. Ningxia wine has gone from an unknown remote region to one of the most talked about wine places on the planet, partly because, as part of a government-backed project, several foreign winemakers lived in Ningxia and each made a red or white wine. AFP PHOTO/GOH CHAI HIN (Photo credit should read GOH CHAI HIN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15f4d250000940038225f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIJING, Oct 10 (Reuters) - To reinvent itself in China's new consumption-driven economy, one region will need to crush a few grapes.After a decade of mining ever more coal to power China's economy, the arid and remote northwestern region of Ningxia is remaking itself as industry slows and demand for fossil fuels is set to wane.Ningxia has set its sights on becoming China's vineyard.By offering tax breaks to winemakers, Ningxia wants to produce wine worth 100 billion yuan ($16.3 billion) by 2020, or roughly 4-1/2 times the contribution of its entire farming sector to gross domestic product last year, said Cao Kailong, deputy director of the region's forestry ministry.Successfully swapping coal for wine as China shifts to a greener and more sustainable model of development would position Ningxia as the example of how to make the leap from an ""old"" to a ""new"" economy, said Shen Minggao, a Citibank economist.""How much value-added can the wine industry produce? This again is related to the quality of services and product and brand names,"" Shen said.""Ningxia will have to compete with some European countries. If they are able to do that, I think the upside is huge.""China's growing thirst for wine means the market, at least, is on Ningxia's side.Chinese drinkers consumed about 1.6 billion liters of non-sparkling grape wine in 2013 including imports, Euromonitor statistics show. Ningxia produced only 16.7 million liters of that, according to government data.The traditional drivers of growth in the world's second-biggest economy are not doing as well. Manfacturing sector growth fell to a six-year low in August, helping to halve global coal prices from a 2011 peak.The slump in coal prices is painful for Ningxia, which quadrupled daily coal production between 2000 and 2010 to 181,000 metric tonnes. ENOUGH JOBS?Yet Ningxia's quest to develop winemaking will not be a cure-all.Industry and construction still make up roughly half its economy, growing 12.5 percent in 2013 and far outpacing growth of 7.5 percent in services and 4.5 percent in agriculture.Wine-making can only partially address its unemployment, which stood at 4.2 percent in 2012, the highest among urban areas in any of China's regions for the fourth straight year.""It will create more jobs than any other agricultural industry, but we cannot expect the wine industry will create jobs like a shirt company, for example,"" said a professor at China Agricultural University, Ma Huiqin, who is a wine project consultant.Winemaking supports about 300,000 people in the region, most of them seasonal migrants who shuttle between vineyards, said forestry official Cao.And the weather could prove a risk. Generally, the region's sandy loam soil and relatively dry climate is well-suited to growing grapes, Ma said.However, Ningxia's plans suffered their first setback soon after the government kicked off its winemaking push, when unusual rains in 2012 caused vines to rot, and cut output by a third.For now, Ningxia remains focused on its winemaking ambitions.The government plans to double the land area of vineyards to about 65,000 hectares (165,000 acres). It will also step up efforts to attract 60 foreign winemakers to Ningxia to build up industry know-how.""They've said put vines in, let's build this up,"" said David Tyney, an Australian who will be working at a Ningxia vineyard as the chief winemaker.""In four or five years' time, you're going to see the effect of all of this planning,"" Tyney said.

Pontiff on Sunday launched a major review of Catholic teaching on the family that could lead to change in the Church's attitude to marriage, cohabitation and divorce. An extraordinary synod, or meeting, of nearly 200 bishops from around the world and a sprinkling of lay people will, for the next two weeks, address the huge gulf between what the Church currently says on these issues and what tens of millions of believers actually do. AFP PHOTO / ANDREAS SOLARO (Photo credit should read ANDREAS SOLARO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f0fc1f00002501252b30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Senior Catholic leaders meeting at the Vatican are deep into passionate debates about how the church can respond to the realities of modern family life, yet at the same time they have repeatedly stressed that they are not going to alter long-standing doctrines, such as the teaching on divorce and remarriage.Does that mean the hopes for real changes are DOA just a few days into the high-level summit?Those who are pushing for reforms say no. They argue that the church can in fact make important adaptations by changing the “pastoral application” of doctrines — how teachings function on the ground.The pastoral practice generating the most attention is the banning of divorced Catholics who have remarried outside the church from receiving Communion.“The reception of Communion is not a doctrinal position. It’s a pastoral application of the doctrine of the church,” said Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl, a delegate at the two-week synod and an influential voice pushing for a new approach.“We have to repeat the doctrine, but the pastoral practice is what we are talking about. That’s why we are having a synod,” he said in an interview with Catholic News Service. “Just to repeat the practice of the past” without trying to “find a new direction today” is no longer tenable, Wuerl suggested.Cardinal Walter Kasper, a retired German theologian and confidant of Pope Francis, has also endorsed that approach.“Nobody denies the indissolubility of marriage. I do not, nor do I know any bishop who denies it,” Kasper told the Jesuit weekly, America. “But discipline can be changed.”“Discipline wants to apply a doctrine to concrete situations, which are contingent and can change,” he added.In fact, the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s — a much larger and more authoritative four-year gathering of the world’s hierarchy – introduced a number of changes, or “developments,” in church doctrine and in pastoral practice.But a sizable contingent of the nearly 200 churchmen at the current synod have forcefully rejected the separation of doctrine and practice outlined by Wuerl, Kasper and others. They say it’s simply a distinction without a difference, and a Trojan horse that could introduce de facto changes in settled doctrine.“There can’t be in the church a discipline which is not at the service of doctrine,” Cardinal Raymond Burke, a former archbishop of St. Louis who now heads the Vatican’s court system, told reporters on the eve of the synod.Burke, a canon lawyer and a leader of the camp opposing changes, said the reformers were saying: “Oh, we’re not questioning the indissolubility of marriage at all. We’re just going to make it easy for people to receive a declaration of nullity of marriage so that they can receive the sacraments.”But that, Burke said, “is a very deceptive line of argument which I’ve been hearing more now in this whole debate.”If that line prevails, he said, Catholics will see those who are divorced and remarried (without an annulment) taking Communion and will assume that the teaching on marriage has changed or they will conclude that the church is hypocritical.Burke’s opinion here is not insignificant — his court is the body ultimately responsible for processing annulment requests from Catholics around the world.The doctrine-versus-disciple argument can sound like an arcane point of theology that could occupy bishops for years, and it often has.But in the context of the current meeting, the concept has emerged as one of the chief ways that the bishops are able to talk about making changes in a church that — whatever the historical record — likes to say that it never changes.Other ideas to accomplish the same goal are also drawing some support, and they include tempering the church’s often absolutist language and attitude toward those in “irregular” situations — such as gay and unmarried couples “living in sin” — and streamlining the annulment process to invalidate an earlier marriage that ended in divorce.Another concept that has generated buzz is the “law of graduality,” a long-standing idea in Catholic thought that recognizes that people gradually move toward holiness and don’t always understand or accept every church teaching at once. Advocates of change say it is important to welcome such people because the sacraments are a way to help them toward holiness; denying the sacraments has the opposite effect, they say.As the bishops break into small groups next week to continue their discussions, the ideas could become more focused, and the debates more heated.In an interview with The Boston Globe published Thursday (Oct. 9), Wuerl said that the delegates have been “speaking their mind” and that the importance of getting doctrine “to work in the concrete order where people live” has become a central focus, just as Pope Francis wanted.Still, Wuerl stressed that this meeting is the first stage in a long process; there will be subsequent discussions and debates in the coming months, and another synod next October with a larger and more diverse groups of bishops, who may have the final vote on any changes.“That’s going to be the challenge, and I think that’s what the Holy Father is calling us to do,” Wuerl said. “He’s saying, We know this, we believe this, this is what is at the heart of our teaching. But how do you meet people where they are? And bring them as much of that as they can take, and help them get closer?”"

The statement specifically addressed allegations that the hospital didn't pay enough attention to Duncan because he was from another country and may not have had insurance. ""Our team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care,"" a statement said Thursday. ""We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.""The hospital also announced Friday it had changed its patient intake process to improve its screening for Ebola, and that it would make its staff available to talk to other hospitals that may have such patients.At a press conference held by Duncan's family on the day he died, Josephus Weeks, his nephew, raised questions about whether the hospital care for the Liberian man was on par with what American missionary workers Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol received at Emory University. Both of them survived Ebola after being transported back to the U.S. for treatment, whereas Duncan had to be diagnosed by the Dallas hospital and died after battling symptoms for two weeks.Weeks didn't elaborate on which aspects of Duncan's treatment the family believes were inadequate, ABC News reported. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has yet to explain why Duncan was initially discharged after his first visit on Sept. 25, which left him on his own to deal with worsening symptoms and widened the window of potential exposure to other members of the Dallas community. Weeks' frustration is understandable, said Dr. Charles Chiu, an infectious diseases expert and the director of the Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center at University of California, San Francisco. Chiu was not directly involved in the care of any of the Ebola patients, but he did comment on the details of Duncan's treatment as they have been reported in the media. He cautiously agreed that the delay in Duncan's care could have affected his outcome.""Any sort of delay of supportive care in the hospital could potentially make a difference,"" Chiu told The Huffington Post. ""Patients will do better if they get care earlier."" On the other hand, Chiu said, ""it's hard to tell whether it made a huge difference.""Health officials have offered explanations for several other significant differences between the treatment Duncan received and that received by other Ebola patients in the U.S., such as a course of the experimental drug ZMapp (given to Brantly and Writebol) or a blood transfusion from a recovered Ebola patient.In the case of both treatments, officials cited factors beyond his doctors' control for determining why they were unavailable to Duncan. The hospital has said that Duncan did not receive a blood transfusion from a survivor because the available blood did not match Duncan's blood type. ""With someone already in critical condition, you wouldn't want to give them mismatched blood,"" explained Chiu. ""It could lead to life-threatening transfusion reaction and endanger their life more."" As for why Duncan didn't receive ZMapp, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that there are no doses of the treatment anywhere in the world, and the hospital said doses haven't been available since Aug. 12. Moreover, ZMapp has not been proven to work, and it's unclear whether it played a positive role in Brantly's and Writebol's recoveries. One day after Duncan died, however, news broke of a Norwegian Ebola patient who is set to receive ZMapp, which has only increased the confusion as to exactly how much of the drug is available and to whom. British paper The Independent reports that the Norwegian patient contracted the virus in Sierra Leone and arrived in Oslo, Norway, on Thursday to begin treatment. A spokesman for Norwegian Medicines Agency told Dagens Medisin on Wednesday that ZMapp was being shipped from Canada. Instead of ZMapp, Duncan received the experimental anti-viral drug brincidofovir, which prior to his treatment had only been tested against Ebola in a test tube and not in animals (as ZMapp had been).The conflicting details about ZMapp are a curiosity, to say the least, and details are still emerging. But there are too many variables between Duncan and Brantly as patients to compare the respective courses of their disease, said Dr. A. Scott Lea, the Infectious Diseases Clinic director at University of Texas Medical Branch. Like Chiu, Lea was also not involved in the direct care of any of the Ebola patients. He serves as clinician to Ebola researchers at UTMB's Galveston Laboratory, one of only a handful of Biosafety Level 4 laboratories in the U.S. As he put it, he's ""the guy who worries what would happen if [Ebola researchers] expose themselves"" to the virus. Anything from a patient's upbringing to their state of health before infection can influence how a body responds to the disease, Lea explained to HuffPost. Brantly, who was born in Indiana, may have had biological advantages that come from being raised in a developed nation -- as opposed to Duncan, who grew up near a leper colony, spent years in different refugee camps as an adult and lived in an impoverished neighborhood in Monrovia, Liberia, before he flew to the U.S. A patient's genetics could also play a role in how Ebola progresses, although research hasn't yet borne that out, Lea explained. For instance, compared with the general population, people from Equatorial Africa are more resistant to malaria, and people from Northern Europe are more resistant to tuberculosis, he said.Even in the best of circumstances, Ebola has a terrifyingly high mortality rate -- up to 90 percent in some recorded outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization. The mortality rate for the current outbreak is estimated to be 48 percent, according to the latest figures from the CDC. Even people who have been treated with ZMapp in Liberia and Spain have died, demonstrating that even the most promising experimental drug has limitations. Ebola still has no proven treatment. In fact, given the relatively small number of people who have been treated with experimental therapies like blood transfusions, ZMapp or brincidofovir, it's scientifically impossible to say if any of these treatments are better or worse than the others, since evidence is only anecdotal, said Chiu. Both Chiu and Lee expressed sympathy for Duncan and his family. Chiu said Duncan's family's experience is ""devastating"" and it must have been difficult for them to be ""unable to touch, hug or communicate with their loved one who is dying,"" for fear of infection. Lea also said that his heart goes out to his family. ""I'm just crushed that this man did not survive,"" he said. ""I wanted American medicine to make him well."""

The decisions came in the wake of the Supreme Court's rejection of appeals to strike down same-sex marriage in several states, including Indiana.On Wednesday Notre Dame notified employees of the change by email, saying: ""Notre Dame is a Catholic university and endorses a Catholic view of marriage. However, it will follow the relevant civil law and begin to implement this change immediately.""A spokesperson for Saint Mary's, a Catholic women's school, told South Bend Tribune that the college would also immediately comply with the law and extend benefits to all married spouses of employees.""Being an out staff member, I feel a lot more confident that my concerns are being heard and responded to,"" Aaron Nichols, an openly gay staff member at Notre Dame, told South Bend Tribune. ""The university is no longer acting in a vacuum. That makes me proud to be ND.""On Monday the Supreme Court declined to interfere with rulings that allow same-sex marriage in Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, Indiana and Wisconsin, which many saw as a precedent that could pave the way for further acceptance of gay marriage around the country. Despite the announcements from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, many private religious schools and institutions still refuse to comply with federal rulings on same-sex marriage and employee non-discrimination. Holy Cross College, Ancilla College, Bethel College and Goshen College -- all religious schools in Indiana -- currently do not offer benefits to same-sex spouses. In Massachusetts, where gay marriage is also legal, a private Christian school Gordon College signed onto a letter of faith-based organizations in July petitioning the Obama administration for exemption from employee non-discrimination regulations on the basis of religious objection to same-sex relationships.The debate has also come to bear in cases where employees are fired after coming out as LGBT. In July, Olivia Reichert and Christina Gambaro were asked to resign from Cor Jesu Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school, when the institution learned of the couple's marriage. Missouri, where Cor Jesu is located, does not allow same-sex marriages but does recognize those performed in other states. Reichert and Gambaro got married in New York over the summer, but felt they had no legal grounds on which to appeal their firing.""The law is not on our side, nor is the church,"" Gambaro wrote on Facebook, ""so we have no ground to stand on.”"

The D will be able to accelerate to 60 miles per hour in just over 3 seconds.

And neither was Tesla.CEO Elon Musk disappointed some people -- at least on Wall Street -- on Thursday when he unveiled exactly what everyone was expecting at a product launch event outside Los Angeles. Tesla rolled out a super-fast, all-wheel drive “D” line of Model S sedans, which come equipped with a limited autopilot function.With the new release, Tesla caught up the competition -- rather than leapfrogging over it. Rivals Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar have already released functions that allow their luxury sedans to park and stay within the lines of the road autonomously. It’s not that Tesla couldn’t have zoomed ahead of its fellow carmakers. It has the technology -- just last week, Musk told CNN that Teslas could be 90 percent “capable of autopilot” by next year. But, regulatory and safety concerns aside, the company is not ready to drastically alter the way people drive cars just as people are beginning to buy the company's vehicles.“If he made this huge announcement about driverless cars, “I’d say, ‘Well, why are you making and selling all these different vehicles that aren’t going to be driven that way?” Carter Driscoll, a senior analyst of clean technology at investment bank MLV & Co., told The Huffington Post.Tesla is slated to debut its first SUV, the Model X, sometime next year -- the company has already taken reservations for preorders for the vehicle. By 2017, the upstart automaker hopes to begin production on the Model 3, its first mass-market vehicle expected to sell for about $35,000.There's no doubt those upcoming cars will feature the new autopilot hardware, which includes frontal radar to detect where other cars are and cameras that can read road signs and adjust the Tesla to meet the speed limit.But that technology, advanced as it may be, still needs to be time-tested, and consumers need more time to get comfortable with it.“What happens when the road sign is covered in snow?” Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at the automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book, told HuffPost. “It’s not that the technology couldn’t do it in theory, it’s that there’s going to be 1 million and one exceptions.”From the vantage point of a technology utopian, driverless cars present endless possibilities -- reducing traffic deaths, scaling back carbon emissions, providing a designated driver anytime a car owner so much as sniffs an alcoholic beverage. That seems to be the vision put forth by Google, which began parading its little, steering wheel-free, beetle-like cars earlier this year. Last year, Tesla kicked off talks with Google about developing driverless cars. And, by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas’ estimation, Tesla may be poised to become the industry leader in autonomous driving.That's what the company did with electric vehicles. Musk has revived the long-dead dream of a zero-emissions car by making an attractive vehicle that's also eco-friendly: The Model S is luxurious, sexily designed and fun to drive -- just ask anyone who’s been behind the wheel of one. But it’s just that -- people like to be behind the wheel.Brauer said the shift to autonomous vehicles will be an evolution, not a revolution.“There’s still a journey to be made to get to autonomous vehicles,” he said. “It’s not a two-year journey, it’s not a five-year journey. It’s going to be years and years in the making.” "

It's the most beautiful bottle of booze he's ever seen...and this guy knows his booze. He jumps off the bus and runs to a liquor store, only to discover that the Chivas is way out of his price range.Undeterred, our hero spends the next 90 minutes chasing the bottle of scotch, using charm, trickery, and hard work. At one point, he comes so close that he can practically taste it--but fate intervenes and thwarts his mission.Finally, he wins his prize. In the closing scene we see him clutching his Chivas and drinking himself into happy oblivion as the credits roll.Of course, this film would never get greenlit in Hollywood. If it did somehow get made--in Sweden, maybe--critics would slam it for ""glamorizing"" alcoholism.But what if, instead of a bottle of booze, the protagonist was chasing a beautiful woman? This would fly in Hollywood. It would, in fact, describe most romantic comedies ever made.For sex and love addicts, a sappy, happy ending can be anything but joyful. It can trigger an obsession, reinforce bad belief systems, or send us spiraling into withdrawal.But here's the thing: For some people, the feeling of falling in love is every bit as addictive as the high from alcohol or cocaine. It's called love addiction. For people like that--people like me, if I'm not on top of my game--the obsessive desire for a love object can be as all-consuming and self-destructive as an alcoholic's need for a drink.Don't get me wrong; I'm not blaming love addiction on romantic movies. But the messages in those movies--plus books, films and plays dating back centuries (Romeo and Juliet, anyone?)--often reinforce toxic notions of love. Love is all you need, love makes the world go 'round, without your love I am nothing, etc.For sex and love addicts, a sappy, happy ending can be anything but joyful. It can trigger an obsession, reinforce bad belief systems, or send us spiraling into withdrawal.Here are 10 ""favorite"" love stories I've encountered over the years. It's taken me more years to undo some of the damage. Caution: Spoilers ahead.1. It Happened One Night (1934)In Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA), there are 12 ""characteristics"" to help identify sex and love addiction, and the very first is: We become emotionally attached to people without knowing them. In this classic film, a rebellious heiress and an out-of-work newspaperman fall for each other while she's running away to elope with another man. ""I don't know very much about him, except that I love him,"" says the rich girl, played by Claudette Colbert, of the penniless reporter played by Clark Gable.No wonder I always adored this film. I was forever falling for my own imagined version of a person. In reality, relationships tend to work better when you're actually acquainted with each other.2. Love Story (1970)SLAA Characteristic 12 is: We assign magical qualities to others ... then blame them for not fulfilling our fantasies and expectations. A rich boy and a poor girl fall in love as Harvard undergrads. He defies his family to marry her, but their perfect life is cut short by her fatal illness. ""Love means never having to say you're sorry,"" the leading lady (Ali McGraw) tells her paramour, played by Ryan O'Neal.The lesson seems to be this: If you truly love someone, you will never hurt or disappoint them--therefore, you will have nothing to apologize for. This is a terrible lesson for a love addict. We already expect our lovers to read our minds and then resent them when they can't.3. Pretty Woman (1990)Characteristic 8: We become...distracted by romantic or sexual obsessions or fantasies. In this widely beloved flick, a wealthy businessman (Richard Gere) hires a prostitute (Julia Roberts) to pose as his girlfriend at a social event, then falls in love with her.True story: In the original script, Roberts' character was tossed back onto the street when her hooker duties were over. And the suggested actor for Richard Gere's part was originally someone more like Danny DeVito. Let's be honest; this sounds a lot more like real life.""I want the fairy tale,"" says the prostitute, and it is the fairy tale that drives this movie's mass appeal. In love addiction circles, we call them ""fantasies.""4. Reality Bites (1994)Characteristic 4: We confuse love with physical and sexual attraction--a common problem for all kinds of people, but especially sex and love addicts. This popular '90s flick about a recent college grad who has to decide between her erratic, creative housemate and an ardent, stable television executive, ends happily, against all odds.But in the real world, if a potential romantic partner tells you, ""I may do mean things, and I may hurt you, and I may run away without your permission, and you may hate me forever"" well, you should probably run. Even if he looks like Ethan Hawke, or she looks like Winona Ryder.Crazed chemistry doth not a committed relationship make.5. Jerry Maguire (1996)""You complete me,"" volatile football player (Tom Cruise) tells vulnerable single mom (Renee Zellweger) in this love addict landmine. It's a ridiculous notion to think of single individuals as half-people, flopping around the planet waiting for some puzzle piece to make us whole. This thought process is a recipe for disappointment and madness. The quest for another human to ""complete us"" is a big part of love addiction.Characteristic 5: We feel empty and incomplete when we are alone...6. Six Days, Seven Nights (1998)This adventure-themed rom com is about a Manhattan fashion journalist (played by Anne Heche) stranded on a South Pacific island with a crusty bush pilot, played by Harrison Ford. Will they manage to overcome their differences to find love? Spoiler alert: yes.Sure, he saved her life, and we do ""confuse love with... the need to rescue or be rescued"" (also in Characteristic 4.) But how will the 30-something magazine editor really feel in 10 years, when stuck with a 66-year-old boyfriend and no running water? Some good old AA wisdom would have served her well: ""Think it through!""7. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)We stay in and return to painful, destructive relationships, is SLAA's Characteristic 2. The lovesick protagonists in this flick, Joel and Clementine, attempt to heal their broken hearts by literally forgetting about one another. Despite the fact that they are ill-matched, have hurt and disappointed one another over and over again and have broken up for good... as soon as they forget the bad stuff, they fall in love all over again.There's a phenomenon in recovery known as ""euphoric recall."" Addicts and alcoholics have a way of remembering the party and forgetting the hangover. This is the same thing, with genitals.8. The Notebook (2004)Love addicts want to have our cake and eat it, too--preferably, with no calories. This film is a classic example of the idealized notion that we can have it all--the intensity of a passionate, obsessive love affair, and the duration of a many-decades-long marriage, all with the same person.In this iconic romcom, a rich girl (Rachel McAdams) and a poor boy (Ryan Gosling) fall in love in 1940's South Carolina. Their dramatic young love affair transforms (spoiler alert--I did warn you...) into 60 years of devoted marriage. But the reality is that this kind of breathless, stalker-y, adolescent relationship rarely lasts. Ryan Gosling is no more likely to grow up to be James Garner than a red Ferrari is to turn into a reliable pick-up truck.9. Crazy Stupid Love (2011)In this movie, a jilted protagonist (Steve Carell) asks a notorious womanizer to teach him how to pick up women, not realizing the player (Ryan Gosling again) has picked up Carell's own daughter (Emma Stone). This is no The Notebook--because this Ryan Gosling character is not the 'till-death-do-us-part type. Anything but! Yet, after one deep-and-meaningful night with Emma Stone, he instantly turns into a devoted, loyal lover. In AA terms, that's called denial: ""Yes, but... this time, it will be different!""The idea of transforming a player into a faithful partner is crack for love addicts. Characteristic 9: We... attach ourselves to people who are emotionally unavailable.10. Silver Linings Playbook (2012)There's a piece of probably every one of the 12 Characteristics in this tale of an ex-mental patient who falls for a beautiful but disturbed young widow. In reality, pairing a depressive sex addict (Jennifer Lawrence) with a bipolar love addict (Bradley Cooper) would not solve their problems. A therapist would tell you it's more likely to make them worse. But this is the movies, so they fall in love and it fixes them both--at least while the credits roll. Sex and love addicts often fall for each other; that doesn't mean it's a good idea.Ethlie Ann Vare is the author of Love Addict: Sex, Romance and other Dangerous Drugs (HCI Books 2011) and the blog www.AffectionDeficitDisorder.com."

""I've done a lot of thinking about this and looked at a lot of different polls, I think it has more to do with the rise in single women,"" Bell said. ""Single mothers particularly are automatically Democratic because of the benefits. They need benefits to survive, and so that kind of weds them to the Democratic Party.""Single women without children, Bell continued, are ""also that way,"" while married women ""aren't that different from married men. So it's really a problem with the decline in marriage rates. The Democrats do benefit from that.""  It's true that unmarried women tend to favor Democrats, while married women favor Republicans. And Democrats are fighting for a range of policies that they believe would particularly benefit women, such as equal pay laws, pregnancy discrimination laws, paid family leave, affordable childcare and universal birth control coverage. Many Republicans, meanwhile, oppose all of those policies and generally oppose legal abortion, which has caused problems for the party among women. Bell opposes legal abortion even in cases of rape and incest -- a position shared by only 10 percent of voters in New Jersey, according to The Star-Ledger.But the candidate told APP that he is not too concerned by the gender gap in his race at this point.

""When I touch a piece of metal, it talks to me. I'm like, 'Wow!'"" He further reveals: ""Because, the thing is, really, this is a very industrial world: we manufacture cars and planes and fast trains and really heavy stuff. So my art is a reflection of our world.""",2014-10-09,2014-10-09-642014H92xL91xP24cmtechniquemixtesuraluminium.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-09-642014H92xL91xP24cmtechniquemixtesuraluminium-thumb.JPG,"More than ever, our world exhibits complex interaction between the human and the mechanical, between organic subtlety and industrial intensity, between the transience of light (consider increasingly fleeting time) and the rigidity (or apparent permanence) of heavy metal. Our minds may be on digital devices, but our bodies are riding planes, trains, and automobiles; elevators, escalators, and matter-transference beams (well, almost).Internationally-acclaimed artist Christophe Leroux displays an innate yet well-tempered sensibility concerning these contrasts - grace and power; fragility and strength -- bringing them forth in dramatic and provocative ways in his show ""New Works"" - which runs through Saturday, October 11, at the Sonce Alexander Gallery, in Los Angeles. Sonce Alexander and Christophe LerouxFrom the official press release:Leroux's harmonious compositions belie their use of modern materials and choice of mediums: metal wall sculptures and paintings on paper. His aesthetic is characterized by ordered layering where colors occupy prominent boundaries, occasionally blending through progressive mechanized copper, zinc and aluminum printing. Often made from materials that are manipulated to reflect color and light, his works are cited by scholarly texts (e.g. the work of Peter Frank) as imparting the belief that an artist is a reflection of society. Leroux's use of handmade stencils symbolizes his inclination to follow in the path of urbanity. The incorporation of language into his work, via geometrical considerations, not only comments on industrialization and urbanization, but globalization as well.Indeed, his works do speak, as does the man. I recently sat down to tea with Monsieur Leroux, and was pleased to find the artist affable, remarkably focused on the intentions of his work -- and a science fiction fan! (Christophe's English is better than my French, and Ms. Sonce Alexander joined us to bridge any linguistic couloirs.) Considering that his work abides in the collections of Nancy Jane Goldston, Blake Byrne, Joseph Smallhoover, Eugenio Lopez, and the Jumex Colección of Mexico City -- plus he's been invited to participate in museum shows at MOCA in Los Angeles and Musée Galliera in Paris -- Christophe has gone global, yet at our table frankly he's disarmingly easygoing and a lot of fun. As he's the son of a builder (turned art collector!) who taught his son well, I ask first how he defines his tradition.""My work is all urban-industrial,"" M. Leroux says. ""And all my influences come from living with trains, airplanes, ships, the big factories, big trucks -- everything very industrial, and essentially very urban. Heavy-duty industrial stuff."" He continues regarding his creative path: ""It's definitely an evolution. I started with concrete pieces. Concrete. And after: concrete and steel. And I moved to concrete and aluminum. And now it's more aluminum -- but all on the wall.""Christophe accentuates this factor: He's not recycling; the materials -- first sculptures, currently hanging pieces -- he sources fresh.""I always work with a clean sheet of steel or aluminum. It's always perfect -- it's like a mirror. Because I really, really, really don't want to have metal pieces which impose on me a size. You see what I mean? I want to choose the size. So I go to the warehouse for metal, and I cut the pieces, the metal sheets, to the size I really want. That's very, very, very important for me.""The British call it aluminium, with a second 'i' -- but I simply ask about the aluminum.""I choose aluminum, because I want to work with the light."" Christophe continues. ""You saw the show. When you have the aluminum pieces, when the light is on, you have some kind of reflection: so it goes from the silver, to basically the dark, dark greys. But when you take the light off - it changes everything. If you put kind of a medium light, it's another feeling. So it's really playing with the light. Because the main thing is: it has to be beautiful. The aesthetic is really, really, really important! So it's very important, the numbers -- I choose the numbers because of the aesthetic of the numbers. It's not random; I don't just put a 3 and a 5 and a 2 -- I choose it because of the shape of the 3, the shape of the 5, the shape of the 2. So there is nothing random."" Opening Night: Rema Ghuloum, Marie Thibeault, Sonce Alexander, Ann HarezlakSonce adds a note: ""You've often said that you choose the shapes,"" she reminds Christophe and enlightens me, ""so, for example, if there's a very square-ish or geometrical shape, he likes to contrast it with something round: like a 3 or 6 or 9. You seem to constantly contrast.""Indeed, much thought goes into this, and Christophe further explains how the shape of a letter or number closes off a direction, while opening another. So I ask him about the words (he prefers short, incisive ones).""I do English and French,"" he laughs. ""The shape dictates. It has to be beautiful."" (And short.) ""That's why I did 'UP,' for example. It's small with the arrow, and you can see all the metal around it. I wanted to do this piece, because I wanted the meaning of 'UP,' but also the light all around it.""For a different quality, Sonce prompts Christophe to discuss his piece, 'UNLOADED.'""'UNLOADED' is divided by two, so you have the upper part: it's all painting; and the bottom part, it's all metal. But I wanted something at the end, to close the piece. So I deeply wanted, for this particular piece, a long word which would take the whole width of the piece. I did it in white because I didn't want it to be 'in your face.' (Sonce adds that the piece is 7' tall by 3 ½' wide - big! - and many dimensions are considered.)We turn to the paint-on-paper works, personally fired at by Christophe's brother, Rodolphe Leroux -- who apparently boasts somewhat superior marksmanship (his bullet holes are closer to the middle). Sonce asks if the pieces, while not necessarily pro-gun, are anti-gun, and Christophe helpfully replies.""No no no no! It's just that when you have a gun, you have to be so careful! If you have a handgun in your bedroom, you put the bullets in the kitchen! You don't keep a loaded gun at your place, because that's dangerous."" Sonce then leads us to consider one of the ""target"" pieces, called ""SAFETY STARTS HERE.""""That's the perfect example!"" declares Christophe in an accent you'd like. ""It's got holes everywhere, and it says, 'SAFETY STARTS HERE.' So it's about being very careful: with guns or rifles or machine guns, or whatever."" Sonce posits that he means more than the safety catch -- but mental and moral safety -- and he concurs.So it's not just big works with this artist -- it's big ideas! Sir Richard Branson and associates, kindly note that Monsieur Leroux would love to be commissioned to paint the tail fins of planes - or whole planes! (Boeing 747-8 and Airbus A380, Christophe's your man.) He's also up to paint the very symbol of industry: the train. ""It would be sooo much fun,"" the artist coos. (Plus he's got some secret projects to reveal in the next couple of years.)Truly, Christophe exults in his work. ""When I touch a piece of metal, it talks to me. I'm like, 'Wow!'"" He further reveals: ""Because, the thing is, really, this is a very industrial world: we manufacture cars and planes and fast trains and really heavy stuff. So my art is a reflection of our world.""Photos and images courtesy of Christophe Leroux and the Sonce Alexander GalleryNote: Immediately after the closing of this show (at 2673 South La Cienega Boulevard), the Sonce Alexander Gallery opens in a new location: 2634 South La Cienega Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90034Sonce Alexander GalleryChristophe Leroux Official Site"
13,MEDIA,Jon Stewart Turning Down 'Meet The Press' Is The Smart Move For All Involved,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jon-stewart-meet-the-press_n_5960640.html,,2014-10-09,"TORONTO, ON - SEPTEMBER 8: Jon Stewart arrives for the red carpet for his movie Rosewater at Princess of Wales. (Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c0093c000032000d05b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York Magazine's Gabriel Sherman managed to get media observers all hot and bothered yesterday when he splashed a pretty great scoop from behind the scenes at NBC News. As Sherman reports, when NBC News' president Deborah Turness was pondering ""Meet The Press'"" transition from the David Gregory Era to its current Chuck Todd-issance, she briefly paused along the way to sound out ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart on whether he might want to take over as the ""MTP's"" host. According to Sherman's source, NBC News was richly baiting the lure: ""They were ready to back the Brink's truck up.""Obviously, this courtship was ultimately unconsummated. And for everyone involved, this is probably for the best. (For example, NBC News still has that Brink's truck, which is nice.)The person who really dodges a bullet here is Stewart himself, by not allowing this truck full of Peacock ducats to tempt him into taking a job that he'd not only really, truly hate having, but also would probably have damaged the legacy he's built for himself as an outsider critic. There's something genuinely Faustian about this attempted assignation: How much money would it take to convince a man to become the thing he's always despised? In this case, the answer would appear to be ""more than you can put in one armored car."" But the idea of having Stewart take over ""Meet The Press"" isn't crazy. Sherman points out that ""the comedian-cum-media-critic possesses something that broadcast executives covet: a young loyal audience."" You can actually extend that covetousness well beyond the realm of broadcast news -- the millennial audience in particular is the nut that every media organization is currently trying to crack. Some are handling the task with more aplomb than others. More often than not, it's the traditional media outlets that have struggled to unlock its treasures. As Nieman Lab's Ken Doctor writes:[The millennial] generation will spend $200 billion annually by 2017 (and $10 trillion in their lifetime) in the U.S. alone. It's the lower end of the 25-54 audience that TV advertisers covet, and therein lies a new tale of budding ad competition. Young consumers' brand buying preferences remain open to suggestion.And let's face it, bringing Stewart to the ""Meet The Press"" studio would have been something of an awkward graft. Stewart's always been a capable interviewer, if we define ""interviewing"" as the simple task of genially greeting a guest and provoking an entertaining conversation. Once Stewart strays from that sort of interview to actual journalistic interlocution, reviews are mixed. Sherman, for example, assesses Stewart quite highly. Mother Jones' Kevin Drum rates him about as low as you can go. For my part, I've found Stewart to be an intermittently capable and always well-meaning interrogator whose reach sometimes exceeds his grasp. (There's nothing inherently wrong with that. In fact, one of Stewart's finest journalistic qualities is his willingness to admit this, as he did in the aftermath of his failed interview of Bush-era legal counselor John Yoo.)Mediaite's Joe Concha, who's got a really fine read on this story as well, goes further in pointing out that the circumstances that allow Stewart to succeed at ""The Daily Show"" just aren't viable for ""Meet The Press"":But while Stewart often does a good interview, for him to carry a full hour with panels and deep dives into policy would not play well once the novelty of seeing him in Tim Russert's old chair wore off. Throw in the fact that he wouldn't have the benefit of 18 writers or (and this is important) a pumped-up studio audience applauding every line, and you have a show that would largely come across as out of place in terms of content and atmosphere.Perhaps the most important thing to remember about Stewart is that he's never been eager to claim the name of journalist, preferring instead to maintain his ""comedian-first"" identity. (""Daily Show"" alum and ""Last Week Tonight"" host John Oliver maintains the same distinction.) To many, this is something of a maddening dodge. After all, Stewart makes many of the moves of traditional journalism, while at the same time handing down critiques of the media with something of a triumphalist flair. Critics of his ""I'm just a comedian"" pose often characterize his stance as an unwillingness to take responsibility for his work or to admit that as a person of influence, he's accountable for the quality of his product. A more balanced view of Stewart's philosophy is to concede that he's more vested in taking responsibility for the comedy (by honoring the traditions from which he emerged). It's a simple declaration (or maybe a warning) that he's not always going to choose to do what journalism demands -- that sooner or later, Stewart's going to have to go with whatever generates the most laughter. Like it or not, he's allowed to do that. But that also makes him a poor choice to helm a Sunday morning public affairs show.Nevertheless, it's interesting to learn that Turness was contemplating such a radical departure for ""Meet The Press"" -- and pay through the moment of zen for it -- because now we know that somewhere at the back of Turness' mind lurks the notion that something really drastic must be done with the show, beyond the new host and remodeled set that it has now.She's not wrong. One of the more infuriating things about the major networks' Sunday morning offerings -- ""Meet The Press,"" ""Fox News Sunday,"" ""This Week"" and ""Face The Nation"" -- is that for all we hear about the intense competition that exists betwixt and between these brands, each show seems caught in the same hall of mirrors, and the only race is in the direction of becoming a wan and enervating imitation of all the others. Collectively, the four shows have all of the substance and energy of a pool report, with none of its cost-effectiveness. Meanwhile, if you go back to the organizations that are competing for the younger audience noted in Ken Doctor's piece, you see a drive toward innovation and differentiation that the Pale Kings of Sunday Morning consistently lack.There's room to do something bold on Sunday morning. Sooner or later, one of these Sunday morning shows is going to quit this slow game of chicken and take a chance. Let's say this about the notion of getting Jon Stewart to fill Tim Russert's shoes: It's a bad idea, but it's the right instinct.READ MORE: NBC Wanted to Hire Jon Stewart to Host ""Meet the Press"" [Daily Intelligencer] Stewart's ""Meet the Press"" Courtship Another Leak During Tumultuous Turness Tenure [Mediaite][Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

14,POLITICS,Labor Department Says System Protecting Workers From Chemicals Is 'Broken',Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/osha-chemicals-safety_n_5960794.html,,2014-10-09,"WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 23: John Howard (R), director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Assistant Labor Secretary David Michaels of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; and Doug Slitor (L), acting chief of the Interior Department's Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs, Offshore Energy and Minerals Management and Minerals Management Service, prepare to testify during a full committee hearing on Capitol Hill June 23, 2010 in Washington, DC. The hearing was on 'Worker Health and Safety from the Oil Rig to the Shoreline,' focusing on how worker health and safety is regulated and enforced by various parties from oil rig workers to post-accident cleanup operations. (Photo by Astrid Riecken/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d90a24000050005773b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The country's top workplace safety official said Thursday that the regulatory system protecting workers from chemical exposure is ""broken,"" and called for a new dialogue with employers and worker safety experts about how it might be improved.""We're struggling to keep pace with the potential hazards,"" Dr. David Michaels, head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a branch of the Labor Department, said on a call with reporters Thursday. ""We think there has to be better ways to take this issue on."" The government tries to protect workers in manufacturing plants and other workplaces with chemicals through so-called permissible exposure limits, which cap the allowable concentration of certain airborne hazards. Yet the vast majority of these limits haven't been updated in the more than four decades that OSHA has existed.Michaels said manufacturing firms currently have their own standards that on paper are stronger than the government's. He also said the government's limits don't come close to covering all of the dangerous chemicals that are now found in the country's workplaces. OSHA standards limit exposure for fewer than 500 chemicals, whereas businesses now use tens of thousands.Efforts in recent years to update the limits, he noted, have been ""largely unsuccessful.""""Forty years after the creation of OSHA, thousands of workers are still becoming ill and dying from exposure to hazardous chemicals,"" Michaels said. ""Many [limits] are dangerously out of date.""One problem, Michaels said, was the vast amount of scientific and economic research needed to change the limits. The regulation of a single chemical could require hundreds or even thousands of pages of documentation and years of work by staff, he said. The agency is looking for new ways to streamline the process. ""We can't go chemical by chemical, because it would take centuries to address all the chemicals that are out there,"" he said.The agency isn't proposing any new federal rules, which often takes years to be developed and reviewed before they can go into effect. At this point, OSHA is merely asking for stakeholders to advise the agency on how it might improve the current system. Michaels said there will be a six-month period of public comments.""I don't think we'll have any answers in six months, but I think we'll have a very useful and robust dialogue,"" he said."
15,MEDIA,Unnamed U.S. Officials Blame News Reports Based On Unnamed U.S. Officials For Militants' Escape,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/khorasan-group-ap-news_n_5961196.html,,2014-10-09,"FILE - In this Sept. 23, 2014 file photo, provided by an anti-Bashar Assad activist group Edlib News Network (ENN), which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, shows Syrian citizens checking a damaged house that they say was targeted by the coalition airstrikes, in the village of Kfar Derian, a base for the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, a rival of the Islamic State group, between the northern province of Aleppo and Idlib, Syria. The barrage of U.S. cruise missiles last month aimed at a terror cell in Syria killed just one or two of the key militants, according to American intelligence officials who say the al-Qaida group is still believed to be plotting attacks against targets in the United States and Europe. (AP Photo/Edlib News Network ENN, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c00a2200004301dc8662.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -– The Associated Press reported Thursday that the U.S. fired 46 cruise missiles last month at Syria-based terrorist cell the Khorasan Group, but only killed one or two key militants. U.S. intelligence officials, speaking anonymously about classified information, suggested to the AP that the strikes didn’t cripple the group “partly because many important members had scattered amid news reports highlighting their activities.” The AP’s Ken Dilanian wrote Thursday:News stories last month, including a Sept. 13 report by The Associated Press that first disclosed the group's significance as a terrorist threat, led some members to flee before the U.S. military had a chance to strike their known locations, U.S. officials said.And who revealed details about the Khorasan Group on Sept. 13 to Dilanian and colleague Eileen Sullivan? (Bold added.)While the Islamic State group is getting the most attention now, another band of extremists in Syria -- a mix of hardened jihadis from Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Europe -- poses a more direct and imminent threat to the United States, working with Yemeni bomb-makers to target U.S. aviation, American officials say.The AP noted in the Sept. 13 article that “many U.S. officials interviewed for this story would not be quoted by name talking about what they said was highly classified intelligence.”It's essential for national security reporters to rely on anonymous sources to find out what's happening within the government. But doing so can be problematic in that those sources aren't accountable for what they say. In this case, unnamed U.S. officials now blame news reports -- and not the unnamed U.S. officials -- for allowing key targets to flee. AP spokeswoman Erin Madigan White responded to questions about the U.S. officials’ criticism of reporting on the Khorasan Group.“The Associated Press can speak only for itself and its reporting,” White wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. “The AP’s Sept. 13 story revealing the name and other details about the Khorasan Group was the product of weeks of reporting with sources, most of whom were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Representatives of the U.S. government asked the AP to withhold from the story some details AP had confirmed, but the AP declined to do that.”The Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald and Murtaza Hussain recently argued that the media helped promote the government's often-anonymous claims that the Khorasan Group represented an imminent threat to the U.S. and thus helped justify military intervention. The strikes aimed at the Khorasan Group, which took place as the U.S. began airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria, reportedly killed about a dozen civilians and immediately prompted anger at the U.S. coalition among ostensible allies within the Syrian opposition."
