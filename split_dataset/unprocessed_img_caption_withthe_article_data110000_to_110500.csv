This week the Scottish Government has announced that they wish to hold an independence referendum in 2014.

The debate has mostly focused on economics, with banking, oil and debt dominating the discourse. Largely absent from the discussion has been international affairs. An independent Scotland must craft a new foreign policy; it is worthwhile considering what that may look like.Scottish foreign policy would differ sharply from current UK foreign policy, with Scotland having a more restrained approach. Many British politicians believe that Britain is ""the empire on which the sun never sets"", and is therefore still an important global player alongside the likes of the U.S., Russia, and China. Those living outside the UK would rightly see this is as wishful thinking, but this desire to remain relevant on the world stage has led the UK to intervene in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. Just last week, Prime Minister David Cameron penned a joint op-ed with President Obama, announcing their intention to confront ISIS. By contrast, Scotland has less interventionist tendencies than the rest of the UK. In the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion, UK-wide polls showed 37 percent against the war, while Scottish polls showed 65 percent in opposition. An independent Scotland would have a far more scaled-back foreign policy, with none of the imperial complex exhibited by the UK. Scotland will continue to play a role in world politics as a member of NATO, but would do so without nuclear weapons, and would be far less likely to embroil itself in quixotic foreign adventures.An independent Scotland would also have a more amicable and productive relationship with the EU (which, despite suggestions to the contrary, it would remain part of). In its involvement with the EU, Scotland would be a far more cooperative player than the British government has been, particular under Prime Minister David Cameron. His government has had an acrimonious relationship with the EU, threatening to veto budgets and political appointments with alarming regularity. As is the case with the UK's interventionism, much of this obstructionism is borne out of a misguided belief that the Britain is a superpower that doesn't need to partner with other EU countries. Indeed, the Cameron government has been pulled so far to the right by the rise of jingoistic parties like UKIP (Britain's answer to the Tea Party), that it has announced its intention to stage its own referendum on exiting the EU. UK polls have indicated that such an initiative would pass, while Scottish polls have consistently shown opposition to leaving the EU, demonstrating that an independent Scotland would be content to remain part of the EU. Scotland's break from the UK would entail a break with Britain's anachronistic foreign policy. While domestic issues will be uppermost in voters' minds, Scots also have a unique chance to redefine Scotland's role in the world.Michael Collins was born and raised in Glasgow and currently lives in the United States, where he works on domestic and foreign policy issues.

1,WORLDPOST,Independence Movements in Europe: Scotland Is Tip of the Iceberg,"Rob McNamara, Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/europe-independence-movements_b_5824364.html,"Some of these are well known like those in the Basque Country, Catalonia and Flanders.

These are uncertain times for denizens of the British Isles. A people famous for their reserve and stiff upper lip are feeling a range of strong emotions that, god forbid, we're in danger of letting show. Frustration. Confusion. Introspection. Awkward displays of patriotism. It's all there in spades. In short, it's pretty unedifying stuff, made harder to stomach by the regular sound of bagpipes on TV.One positive, though, has been the abundance of new tidbits of information ripe for consumption. My favourite so far has been better understanding the abundance of movements similar to the Scottish National Party (SNP) that exist across Europe. Some of these are well known like those in the Basque Country, Catalonia and Flanders. Others are much more surprising -- for example, hands up if you really knew about the Venetian and Bavarian independence movements?The European Free Alliance (EFA) represents 40 progressive nationalist, regionalist and autonomist parties throughout Europe. Its member parties possess a range of different objectives that include minority recognition and greater regional autonomy to 'the biggie' -- outright independence. It's a fascinating list of members. Here's just a few: there's the Union Démocratique Bretonne (Brittany); the Liga Veneta Repubblica (Venice); the Bayernpartei (Bavaria); Ålands Framtid (the Aland Islands); Süd-Tiroler Freiheit (South Tyrol); Moravané (Moravia); Chunta Aragonesista (Aragon); Mebyon Kernow (Cornwall); Partido Sardu (Sardinia); Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Catalonia); Lausitzer Allianz (Lusatia) and Partit Occitane (Occitania). I could go on. Now try and find them on a map...The EFA and its member parties are understandably delighted with the progress being made in Scotland and Catalonia (the latter of which has its own referendum on independence on November 9). These examples amongst others, the EFA believes, could help embolden the ambitions of its other member parties, many of whom aren't currently seeking full independence. After Scotland, Catalonia, Flanders and the Basque Country, Gunther Dauwen, Director of the EFA, points to Corsica as another one to watch. With elections for the Corsican Assembly tabled in December 2015, greater calls for independence are fully expected, as well as the election of more Corsican nationalists into the Assembly. Dwell upon this for too long and you could be forgiven for thinking that many of Europe's traditional boundaries will change significantly within our lifetimes. It's not, of course, quite as dramatic or as straightforward as that. Many of these movements in Europe remain fringe at best. What is undeniable, though, is that the popularity of certain movements have surged of late, surpassing the expectations of even the most seasoned experts.But surely all these moves for independence are at odds with the increasingly globalised world we live in? To use a trite, well-rehearsed refrain of the UK's 'Better Together' campaign, should we not be celebrating that which brings us closer together rather than focussing on that which divides us? Gunther Dauwen of the EFA says no. 'The world economic crisis shows that the dogma of globalisation has reached its absolute limits,' he says. 'People long for decentralisation instead of anonymous global uniformity. They want to go in search of their roots and implement positive new policies that address problems in a completely different way.' To be fair, he's got a point -- at least where Scotland is concerned. The rise in support for the SNP can be seen as a rejection of 'Westminster politics' with all of its perceived cliques, cabals and agendas. Whether the Scots vote 'yes' or 'no' on Thursday remains to be seen: current polls indicate it's almost too close to call. What is certain is that Europe's nationalist movements - from Scotland to Sardinia, from Catalonia to South Tyrol - will endure, however out of step from the mainstream some of them might first appear."
2,POLITICS,Limiting Voter Participation in the Middle of Crisis,"Rev. Al Sharpton, ContributorPresident, National Action Network",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/limiting-voter-participat_b_5824976.html,"When we look at the situation in Ferguson, Missouri and the tragic death of Michael Brown, we are reminded of the importance of who we elect to our city councils, who sits on our local board of education committees, who we pick to represent us in Congress, in the Senate and more.",2014-09-15,"WILSON, NC - OCTOBER 18: People wait in line to vote at the Board of Elections early voting site on October 18, 2012 in Wilson, North Carolina.

But unfortunately, not everyone will be able to cast a vote. On Friday, a federal appeal's court reinstated Wisconsin's harsh voter ID law that will in effect disenfranchise thousands of minority and poor voters from the upcoming election. Wisconsin is just the latest state to join dozens of others with new draconian voting laws already on the books. If this summer has taught us anything, it's to remind us of the significance of elections as the leaders we choose will make decisions that impact us directly on a daily basis. Whether it's policing tactics, public education, legislation to combat domestic violence, access to quality health care and more, who we elect will greatly determine key issues that matter to us all. The question is, if we are in a crisis with so many things hanging in the balance, why limit participation in the process? The answer is pretty obvious.  Georgia State Senator Fran Millar recently made shocking and outrageous statements in response to early voting in Dekalb County, specifically at the South Dekalb Mall. He stated: ""This location is dominated by African American shoppers and it is near several large African American mega churches ... Is it possible church buses will be used to transport people directly to the mall since the poll will open when the mall opens?"" He was also quoted as saying that he would prefer ""more educated voters than a greater increase in the number of voters."" His glaringly partisan and discriminatory words are indicative of many so-called elected officials who would rather shut citizens out of the electoral process because they know that the power rests in the hands of the people. Even when tremendous amounts of money are poured into election campaigns, the people have the final say when they walk into that voting booth. They know it and we know it. And that's exactly why they have been working so diligently to keep many away.  When we look at the situation in Ferguson, Missouri and the tragic death of Michael Brown, we are reminded of the importance of who we elect to our city councils, who sits on our local board of education committees, who we pick to represent us in Congress, in the Senate and more. The horrific cases in Ferguson, in Staten Island with the death of Eric Garner, and all across the country serve as stark reminders that we must have a say in who polices us, and how that policing is done. We must, we must, let our voices be heard on Election Day. We cannot reform institutional racism or systemic policies if we are not actively engaged. It's not enough to simply complain about injustice; the only way to prevent future injustice is to create the society we would like to see, one where we are all equal under the law.   Back in 1990, Joe Biden (who was a Senator at the time), introduced the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in Congress. Though it took a few years for the Act to be signed into law, it transformed the way in which we investigate and prosecute crimes against women. According to the White House itself: the VAWA changed law enforcement practices, improved the criminal justice system, and created a network of services for victims. The bill established new federal crimes of interstate domestic violence and stalking, doubled penalties for repeat sex offenders, and sparked the passage of laws at the state level to protect victims. Since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, rates of domestic violence have decreased by over 50%. In light of the Ray Rice incident, it's important to keep pertinent issues like domestic violence and women's rights on our radar as we head to the polls in November. Again, who we elect can greatly impact a woman's right to choose, and what sorts of laws are in place to protect her. All women, regardless of her economic status or racial background, have a right to vote and no politician or regressive law should prevent her from doing so.  Recently, much of our attention has also been focused overseas with growing threats from groups like ISIS and tensions around the world. As the president seeks support both at home and abroad for a resolution to these crises, who we elect to Congress and the Senate will also have international implications. Do we want leaders that will work together to create sustainable solutions? Or do we send obstructionists that are more concerned with their own personal agendas instead of resolving major issues? Just one more reason why every vote -- and I mean every vote -- matters this November.  There is no shortage of challenges currently facing us. Whatever your passion, your cause, your calling in life, you must remember how vital it is to have your say in the upcoming election. The right-wing is taking extreme measures to stop your ability to vote because they understand the power that it holds. Let us prove them all wrong once again. Limiting voter participation in the middle of a national crisis is unacceptable and we will not go for it. Too many have fought and died for our right to vote so if people think we will not push back -- guess again.  Every person, every vote."

Four years later, could it be time for a reunion? Salma Hayek, who helped adapt and executive produce the series, recently spoke to E! about the possibilities of a reunion. “I would love to,” Hayek said at the Toronto Film Festival, where she was promoting her animated adaptation of Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet.” Despite her desire to reunite the cast of a show that has “such a special place in my heart,” the Mexican actress said she thought it was unlikely to happen anytime soon. “Ugly Betty” premiered on ABC in 2006. It came to life thanks to Silvio Horta, who adapted the series from the global sensation that was Colombia's telenovela “Yo Soy Betty, La Fea.” ABC’s version starred America Ferrera as the titular character and was a huge step for Latinos in entertainment in the United States due to its massive mainstream success. While there might not be a Betty reunion on its way, fans of the series will be happy to know that Horta is working on a new project for NBC.According to EW, earlier this month the Cuban-American writer and producer was given a script commitment for “The Curse of the Fuentes Women.” Horta’s new series follows the story of the women in the Fuentes family and how their lives are changed after a young man washes up on Miami Beach claiming to be a long-lost relative from Cuba. The show, according to Deadline, uses “the Latin American tradition of magical realism and explores the power of memory and mythology in shaping our destinies.”h/t Latina"

""Sometimes they shortchange you on the olives,"" Hagerty, who still goes to Olive Garden every few months, told HuffPost, referring to the chain's endless salad. Occasionally, she complains about the shortage. Hagerty's strikingly earnest review of the ""long-awaited"" Olive Garden in Grand Forks, N.D. went unexpectedly viral in 2012.""Once they brought me a little dish of olives,"" she said. ""Sometimes they ignore me.""They shouldn't. In an email, an Olive Garden representative wrote: ""If a guest would like extra olives on their salad, all they have to do is tell us.

She calls the unlimited salad and breadsticks ""the trademark of Olive Garden.""""To me, it's just so Olive Garden,"" she said ""Nobody else does it quite like that.""She also doesn't mind that they don't add salt to the pasta water.""To me it isn't really a big deal,"" she said, acknowledging they likely salt the pasta later on in the pasta-making process.

6,LATINO VOICES,"What Does It Mean to Be Latino? Everyone Brandishes the Term, but There Are Many Meanings and Interpretations","Andres T.

Or any of the other hyphenated Latinos coming from 27 different national heritages?",2014-09-15,2014-09-12-Summer_2013_HermanasTapia_SimiValley_Folder2361.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-12-Summer_2013_HermanasTapia_SimiValley_Folder2361-thumb.JPG,"Photo: Andrés T. TapiaWhether it's during the annual Hispanic Heritage Month, election season, or conversations about marketing's new target demographic, it's easy to talk about ""Hispanics"" or ""Latinos."" These terms get thrown around and everyone nods as if there is a common understanding of who we are talking about. To begin with, people put a lot of energy into trying to figure out the difference between ""Hispanics"" and ""Latinos."" The very fact that these terms are often used interchangeably in the media but have meaningful but not-so-simple-to-explain differences in their origins, who uses them and how is telling in itself. But which term to use is only the tip of the iceberg. When we say ""Latino"" or ""Hispanic,"" are we referring to the first-, second-, third-, or fourth-generation Latino? The baby boomer, generation X, or millennial Latino? The English-, Spanish-, or Spanglish-dominant Hispanic? The Peruvian immigrant or the Honduran American born in Wichita? Or any of the other hyphenated Latinos coming from 27 different national heritages? So when the media zero in on the 11 million undocumented immigrants, and when marketers focus on the 34 million Spanish speakers (including the undocumented immigrants), they are looking at important segments under the ""Latino"" umbrella but not the whole. For example, they most often overlook the 26 million English-dominant Latino millennials, who paradoxically also tend to identify with the heritage of their parents' country of origin (Colombian, Costa Rican, Argentinian, etc.), according to the Pew Hispanic Center. In fact, according to that same study, only 16 percent of them see themselves as white, whereas twice as many older Latinos identify as white. This means that younger Latinos are less likely to be assimilationist in mindset than were their first-generation parents, who -- facing discrimination due to their limited or accented English -- often chose not to teach their kids Spanish. M'hija, my daughter, is a case in point. I think back to just a few years ago: Tiara perched on her jet-black hair, she looked radiant and happy, surrounded by her friends and family. It was her quinceañera -- her 15th birthday -- a rite of passage in Latino culture, where a girl becomes a young woman. Mom, a European American, and Papi, proud... and torn. Our daughter was coming of age, and this joyous celebration, with 200 people, a live salsa band, and a Peruvian food buffet, also marked one major milestone in Marisela's passage toward independence and coming into her own identity. Many millennials, while having embraced that American-kid love of hotdogs, the Super Bowl, and American Idol, also see themselves as Latino. In effect, many have embraced their American identity as well as their Latino love of abuela, arroz con pollo, and quinceañeras. It's no surprise, then, that seven in 10 young Hispanics report that they regularly blend English and Spanish into a Spanglish hybrid. These young Latinos epitomize a new American bi- and multicultural identity. My own daughter lives this. She talks about being Peruvian-American even though she was born and raised in the United States. She embraced becoming bilingual and multicultural, as her friendships include girls and boys who are Jewish, European-American, black, and Latino. She spent extended time in Peru, where she found love and ended up marrying a Peruvian. The multidimensional identity mix does not stop here. Millennial Latinos also are more likely to be in mixed ethnic and racial relationships, and, as they have children, we have to talk about blended identities of the Blaxican, the Mexipino, the China Latina. Adult ChoicesWhile millennial Latinos are shaping their own Latino identities, so are those in the older generations in the rapidly changing demographic landscape. This was the lively topic of conversation at dinner in Boston's North End, on the outdoor patio of Ristorante Fiore, an Italian restaurant on Hanover Street, after a successful diversity conference. We were a group of Latinos -- some sipping wine, others espressos -- and in between bites of bruschetta and raw oysters, we discussed and debated accented English as it relates to Latino identity in the workplace. Why is it that having a French or British accent is seen as a plus, but having a Spanish accent a minus? And because of this, should Latinos who speak English with a Spanish accent work at reducing their accent? As the alcohol and caffeine took their effect, the conversation around how we sound dipped into a discussion about identity and success when one is in the minority. The answers are not easy, the implications uncomfortable. Here we are, a table of Latinos from different countries, with different migration stories, having made different choices. What path should each of us take? I described facing, at best, ridicule and teasing and, at worst, outright discrimination due to my heavily accented English during visits to El Norte when I was young. This experience motivated me to work on my accent when I came to the United States for college. The responses to my words clearly shifted toward more positive reactions as I calibrated my inflections, pitches, and tones. It was as if I had put on accent-attitude X-ray glasses. From that point on, it was as clear as tequila that many English-dominant European Americans heavily weigh their assessment of the value of words by the density of the accent of Spanish-dominant speakers. But others around the table at Ristorante Fiore have made a different but equally valid choice. For them, how they sound, including their accented English, is part of their Latino identity. It is a marker of who they are culturally, in the same way that ""Martinez,"" ""Ochoa,"" ""Jimenez,"" and ""Castillo"" are name markers of a Latino identity that is so paramount that even when offered a choice of different circumstances through a more Anglicized name, they wouldn't choose it. Yet others do. We pick our cultural identity spots. Este es quien soy. This is who I am. Increasingly, for Latinos, particularly Latino millennials, the assimilationist survival tactics of their parents are not as necessary or desirable. Instead, our choices regarding how to let our Latino selves show up in American society are as diverse as the various peoples that make up the Latino/Hispanic fabric en los United States de America."

And I'm talking about Wall Street as it relates to Main Street. I'm talking about how individual investors are being courted (hunted) and cared for (killed) by the new wolves of Wall Street.Brokers have now become an endangered species as the model has been attacked on two sides by fee-only investment advisers (aka, RIAs) and discount brokers advocating a DIY approach. And now there's a third entrant attacking both the brokers and RIAs: robo-advisers. All in all this evolution is good for investors as it ultimately brings down costs.But don't underestimate greed's resilience and its willingness and ability to adapt. As they say, ""the more things change, the more the stay the same."" Many brokers are making the switch to RIAs. In fact, they're doing it in droves (witness the growth of the likes of LPL Financial). Changing your title and even your business plan, however, won't magically turn a wolf into a sheep but it does make him harder to identify.Make no mistake. There are plenty of wolves left on Wall Street. They just don't call themselves wolves anymore. In fact, they do everything in their power to look like innocent, cuddly sheep. They setup as RIAs now. Many even preach a low-cost, passive or index-based approach to investing, aligning themselves with the likes of Burton Malkiel, Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle, some of the most respected names in the business.It's the ultimate hypocrisy. You see, while they preach a low-cost approach and may actually use low-cost products like index ETFs, they'll charge you an arm and leg for the privilege -- as much as 2 percent per year. As Meb Faber put it, ""you're a predator if you're charging 2% commissions and or 2%+ fees for doing nothing."" I'm sure the wolves, who normally brag about 'eating what they kill,' would take this as a compliment. Meb continues,Anything more than 0.5% or so on top of fund fees is either paid a) out of ignorance, which is not always the investor's fault or b) as a tax for being irresponsible. For the latter I mean a fee to keep you out of your own way of chasing returns and doing something stupid, much in the same way someone pays Weight Watchers or any other diet advice program when you know what you should be doing (eat less, exercise more).I'd say that anything more than 0.25% for ""managing"" a passive portfolio of index ETFs these days is obscene (it's not even really ""managing"" if it's passive - more like ""overseeing""). And there are plenty of advisers charging nearly ten times that amount. And what's the money for? What are you paying these fees for year after year? Because if the funds themselves do all the work and merely need to be rebalanced a couple of times it might take 15 minutes per year.At the end of the day, you're paying for the pleasure of their company. And that 2% fee might not seem like much but it really adds up over time. As Albert Einstein famously said, ""compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it."" Over 40 years, on $100,000 initial investment, that 2% fee you're paying compounds into roughly $2 million. Even Kate Upton's company is not worth that much.That chart above shows the growth of $100,000 over 40 years assuming a rate of return of 9.68% for the index fund (the return over the past 40 years) and 7.68% for the investor paying 2% to his adviser. The DIY guy ends up with a little over $4 million and the guy with the wolf, I mean adviser, ends up with a little less than $2 million. That's right, the wolf ends up eating over half of your profits.So when I call these fees ""predatory"" or ""obscene"" this is why. Wolves preaching a low-cost, passive approach and charging these fees represent the height of hypocrisy - or the height of greed - take your pick."

This is her story.Depression is like being in a tunnel. You see no light. You're trying to figure out a way out of it, but over time you stop thinking you'll ever see sunlight. Depression is something that has obviously been fatal for many people recently in the news. You see some talk of preventive measures, but not enough. I believe everything happens for a reason. I didn't have many happy stories when I was going through my battle. I hope I can be able to assist other people.I have borderline personality disorder. It's emotional irregularity; there are highs and lows but no real in-between, and it affects my entire life. You're not able to deal with things that go on in the regular world because you don't know how. My mom was never diagnosed with any mental illness, but she has her own problems, and things between us were not always the most pleasant.I was on up to eight different medications at one time. I've done talk therapy. I found that professionals can help, of course, but unless they've suffered mental illness themselves, sometimes you feel like that person just doesn't understand. My doctor didn't always know what to do with me; there is no cure for borderline personality disorder.I moved to Washington state in 2005 with my then-fiancé. By 2010, my relationship was breaking down. In 2011, after I left him, I lost my insurance and could no longer afford my medications. I basically spent the next few months in bed, withdrawing from eight different medications. I was very depressed. Honestly, I wanted to die. I didn't like myself, I didn't like other people, everything was just negative. Near the school I went to, there are tree houses in the middle of the woods. I took a sheet off my bed, made a noose out of it and went to one of the tree houses. I had been on all these medications for years, some of them highly addictive, and I didn't know what my future was going to be. I was just done. There I was with the noose around my neck. I almost climbed the ladder and jumped off, but something stopped me. I called my ex-fiancé's sister and she told me to go to the hospital. By the time I got there, I had clicked out of whatever mode I was in. ""I took this picture in August 2014 at the place I almost committed suicide in Olympia, Washington.""There are two decisions on that path. I was still lost for a while, but I chose to still be here. I ended up moving to Milwaukee and started drinking like crazy. A lot of people with mental illness turn to drugs or alcohol. All they want to do is feel good. After being in Milwaukee about five months, I moved back in with my parents. I was getting drunk six out of seven nights of the week. I was so depressed, and it felt like the only thing that could possibly bring me happiness.I met a friend online, and I started to see things differently with this good friend by my side. He suggested applying to jobs to get me out of the house and to get a little money. We're no longer friends -- I was a drunk asshole, and how much of that type of behavior can you take? -- but he became my inspiration. I started to do a 12-step program, and now, I haven't had a drink in almost a year.I had also started losing weight [Lisa shared her weight loss story with HuffPost in August here], which helped. I don't smoke anymore, I don't drink anymore, I'm going to the gym; it was a platform to be able to build off of. I'm not suicidal anymore, and I rarely get depressed. People who know me tell me I've changed. I'm able to experience life as it exists, instead of on other people's terms.I don't take any medication now. I'm very big about dialectical behavior therapy(DBT). If I'm worried about something I can't control, it puts me in the place where I can say I can do something about this and focus my energy and figure things out, instead of irrational thoughts and acting on impulse. Between DBT and the 12 steps, I've realized I don't have to react to something right away. I can step back, chill out and get back to this later, which relieves stress so that I don't become depressed.Just like not everyone has to get married and have kids and a great house and a great job to lead a successful life, people with mental illness are just having different personal experiences, and that's OK. When people tell me to just cheer up, I'd love to, I really want to, but they need to have sympathy and understanding.I want to start a conversation about what causes someone to go through with suicide. It's out of desperation, when you've lost hope. If you're stuck in a world of depression, how long are you going to be able to take that? I wish the public would understand. People want to hear [stories like mine] because it gives them hope -- and it could, possibly, save someone's life. Lisa, todayAs told to Sarah Klein.
