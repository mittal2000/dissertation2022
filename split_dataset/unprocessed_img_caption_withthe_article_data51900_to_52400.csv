With the capacity to host 6,300 passengers in 2,706 cabins, the cruise ship ― owned by Royal Caribbean International ― is equipped to offer a range of entertainment and sporting activities, including surfing lessons, rock-climbing, and dance classes.For a photography project, Sicilian photographer Maria Vittoria Trovato spent time aboard the Allure of the Seas, which she describes as a city on the move.“I’ve always enjoyed watching what other people do when they’re together, especially in a limited space like a specific neighborhood, a shopping mall, a U.S. military base, or, in this case, a cruise ship ― which is like a traveling city,” says the photographer.The photos Trovato took on the massive cruise ship will be exhibited as part of the Gibellina PhotoRoad - International Open Air Photography Festival, which will be held from July 29 to August 31 in Gibellina, Sicily.“Maria Vittoria Trovato’s project is a perfect interpretation of ‘disorder,’ the theme of this first edition of the festival,” says Arianna Catania, the artistic director of the photography festival.“This is a cruise ship that thousands of passengers climb aboard to seek out little bits of surrogate happiness; to forget the grey pallor of everyday life; to experience gift-wrapped emotions. All without paying any attention to the surrounding sea and the consequences that a ‘monster’ of this size can represent for the ecosystem of our planet,” says Catania.

3,WOMEN,Watch Matt McGorry Call Out An Extremely Sexist Radio Show,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/watch-matt-mcgorry-call-out-an-extremely-sexist-radio-show_us_57839d76e4b01edea78e9095,Well done sir.,2016-07-11,McGorry ain't got no time for sexist radio segments. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5783a1b71b00002600f6d280.png?cache=EpHjw2fi6B&ops=crop_0_101_442_436%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Matt McGorry is not here to let sexist bullshit slide. Late Friday night, the “How To Get Away With Murder” actor was in a cab when the driver turned on a Los Angeles radio show called The Woody Show on 98.7 FM. To his horror, McGorry found himself listening in on The Woody Show’s insanely sexist segment called “Fat Chick/Skinny Chick,” in which the host tries to guess if the woman is fat or skinny depending on her answers to certain questions.Later that night, McGorry tweeted his thoughts on the sexist segment. Scroll below to see his initial reaction tweets. “I remember it from @allisonficht getting attacked in 2015. Where they mocked her for complaining to the producer by telling her to go make ‘bacon and eggs,’” McGorry tweeted.The actor was referring to a incident in 2015 when graduate student Allison Ficht wrote a letter to the producer of “Fat Chick/Skinny Chick” urging the producer to take the show off air. Instead of listening to Ficht, the show publicly berated her and told her to “go make me some bacon and eggs,” and “get the fuck out,” as she wrote in a December 2015 Ms. Magazine article. According to McGorry, The Woody Show’s social media team was defensive in their response to the actor on Twitter. Although The Woody Show later deleted their tweets, McGorry tweeted screenshots of the responses before they were taken down. The Woody Show accused McGorry of lying, claiming that he couldn’t have heard their segment so late at night since the show only airs in the morning. “@MattMcGorry do you always blindly attack people online? Because you claim to have ‘heard’ all this on our show,” the show’s social media team tweeted. “It [sic] sic weird you [can’t] come up with dates and times.” The show also tweeted screenshots from the radio station’s Instagram showing their support for Orlando after the June 2016 attack, apparently to suggest that expressing sorrow for a national tragedy excuses promoting blatant misogyny on a regular basis. “This is the kinda people we are,” the show tweeted. McGorry quickly fired back assuring the radio show he did indeed hear their segment, posting a video of him listening ― and reacting ― to the segment in the cab.In the clip, McGorry asks the cab driver what radio station is playing. “Man, that’s some sexist shit,” he says, to which the driver responds: “Nah, it’s just a game.”McGorry tells the driver that he thinks it’s “fucked up” to guess “if a chick is fat or skinny based on if she likes butt sex.” Right before McGorry stops filming he asks the driver to change the channel. The next day, McGorry followed up with The Woody Show, tweeting: “I know you deleted about 10 of your tweets and the description off the site. Can we count this as an admission that you understand how bad this game is? (It’s ok to apologize btw).” Way to speak up, Matt. The Huffington Post reached out to The Woody Show for comment, but did not hear back by the time of publication. "
4,POLITICS,Possible Trump VP Pick Actually Believes In Women's Right To Choose,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-michael-flynn-abortion_us_578252cfe4b01edea78e42e6,“They are the ones that have to make the decision because they’re the ones that are gonna decide to bring up that child or not.”,2016-07-10,Retired Gen. Michael Flynn is reportedly being vetted as a running mate for Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578253e91b00002600f6d08a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A possible vice presidential running mate for Donald Trump said on Sunday that women should have the right to abortion. Retired Gen. Michael Flynn seemed to struggle for an answer when ABC News’ Martha Raddatz asked for his position on abortion. But he made his position clear.“I think for women ― these are difficult issues ― I think women have to be able to choose what they ― sort of the right of choice,” Flynn told her on “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”“I think that’s a difficult legal decision and I think that women are so important in that decision-making process,” he continued. “They are the ones that have to make the decision because they’re the ones that are gonna decide to bring up that child or not.”Flynn said he didn’t know if he was being vetted to be Trump’s running mate but he was honored to be part of the discussion. Like with most issues, Trump’s position on abortion varies from day to day. He said in March that “there has to be some form of punishment” for women who have abortions. He seemed to say in April that he didn’t favor overturning laws that make abortion legal. In May, he vowed to appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court if he wins the presidency. In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain shied away from choosing Democrat-turned-Independent Joe Lieberman as his running mate because of conservative ire over Lieberman’s pro-choice views. Anti-abortion groups are not pleased. Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement that Flynn has “disqualified himself” from the vice presidency. “His pro-abortion position is unacceptable and would undermine the pro-life policy commitments that Mr. Trump has made throughout the campaign,” Dannenfelser said. This piece has been updated to include Dannenfelser’s statement.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Now, one organization is working to help bail them out of jail. The Louisiana National Lawyers Guild launched a Crowdrise campaign early Sunday morning to raise money and help cover legal expenses of protesters behind bars. Many demonstrators took over the streets and marched on highways to demand justice in the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. More than 1,500 people have donated to the fund and it has raised more than $75,000 as of Sunday afternoon. Their goal is to reach $300,000. “Since Friday, July 8, more than 60 people have been arrested in protests against the killing of Alton Sterling,” a statement of the campaign’s site reads. “This is a bail fund to get those protestors out of jail.” The number of protesters who have been taken into custody has jumped since Friday to 102. Prominent activist Deray McKesson was among those arrested Saturday night in a chilling moment that he captured on camera. Police later charged him with “simple obstruction of highway commerce” after warning him not to get close to police. However, those who were with him say he did nothing wrong.McKesson was reportedly held in custody along with 33 others while police continued to detain dozens of protesters from other areas of the demonstration. His bail has not yet been set, Quartz reported.Brittany Packnett, another prominent activist who marched directly behind McKesson, picked up his phone and continued to live-stream the aftermath of his arrest.“He was standing on the side of the road. He was not disobeying police officers whatsoever. He was snatched and grabbed,” she says. “Start calling the Baton Rouge Police Department to demand that he’s released.”Many promptly followed her instructions and shared information on how to contact the Baton Rouge police. The Louisiana lawyers’ guild created the Crowdrise campaign to help with next steps for the countless protesters who are still detained. “Call our legal hotline at (225) 341-2287 with any questions about this page or legal support for protesters,” it says on their page.

Police made arrests and used smoke bombs and marking rounds to disperse the crowd.Protesters at the scene said police fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Police said early on Sunday they had begun clearing the highway of debris in preparation for re-opening it.A march in Baton Rouge saw scuffles between riot police and Black Panther activists, several of whom carried shotguns. Louisiana law allows for weapons to be carried openly.After a short standoff later in the evening, riot police arrested as many as 30 demonstrators and recovered weapons. Prominent black activist and former Baltimore mayoral candidate Deray McKesson was among those arrested.Protests also took place Saturday in Nashville, where protesters briefly blocked a road, and in Indianapolis. A rally in San Francisco also briefly blocked a freeway ramp, according to local media.Hundreds of protesters marched from City Hall to Union Square in New York. The crowd swelled to around a thousand people, closing down Fifth Avenue.Some chanted “No racist police, no justice, no peace” as rain fell in New York.”I’m feeling very haunted, very sad,” said Lorena Ambrosio, 27, a Peruvian American and freelance artist, “and just angry that black bodies just keep piling and piling up.”New York police said they arrested about a dozen protesters for shutting down a major city highway.(Additional reporting by Laila Kearney, Elizabeth Barber and Chris Michaud in New York; Writing by Nick Carey; Editing by Mary Milliken and Ryan Woo)"

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Martyn HermanLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Andy Murray put the finishing touch to an almost faultless fortnight to claim a second Wimbledon title with a 6-4 7-6(3) 7-6(2) defeat of big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic in the Centre Court sunshine on Sunday.The world number two, champion in 2013, was in control throughout the two hour 48 minute contest as the power game that sixth seed Raonic employed to crush Roger Federer in the semi-finals made little impact on the 29-year-old Scot.Unlike three years ago when near hysteria broke out as Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a Wimbledon men's singles champion, there has been an air of inevitability about title march since top seed Novak Djokovic crashed out early.Murray did not disappoint as he claimed a third grand slam title in almost routine fashion as he blunted Raonic's 140mpnh serve and made only 12 unforced errors in the final.""This is the most important tournament for me every year. I had some great moments here and tough losses too so that makes it extra special,"" Murray, who sobbed into his towel on his courtside chair as the triumph sank in, said on court.""I'm proud to get my hands on the trophy again.""The final was billed as a showdown between one of the world's biggest servers and arguably the best returner.Murray broke the Raonic serve only once, midway through the opening set, but always seemed in control as the Canadian struggled to lay a glove on the elusive Scot.SECOND BESTRaonic had been hoping to become Canada's first grand slam singles champion and while he battled gamely to the end he conceded he had been second best.""Andy has been playing great and he deserves to be winning here for the second time,"" he said.""This one is going to sting so I'm going to make sure that as long as these courts are green I'll do everything I can to be back here for another chance.""The first chink Raonic's armor came in the seventh game when he netted a forehand volley to hand Murray a break.The Scot pressed repeatedly for another break in the second set but Raonic showed great resilience to take it to a tiebreak, only for Murray to raise his game to a new level.The match was more than two hours old when Raonic finally had two break points at 2-2 in the third set, but Murray saved both and held -- roaring angrily towards his coach Ivan Lendl.Twice Raonic held serve to stay in the match, at 4-5 and 5-6, but Murray again upped the ante in the tiebreak, winning the first five points as he surged towards victory.Raonic saved one match point but Murray wrapped it up when he forced the Canadian to net a backhand.Murray's win meant he avoided becoming the first man to lose in the final of the first three majors of the year in the professional era -- having succumbed to Djokovic in Australia and France.(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ken Ferris)"

Hope your stay in #Dallas was great sir!”When asked by TMZ if he had any words for Zamarripa’s family, Gooding turned to the camera and clasped his hands together as if in prayer.“I cried today when I heard that. I cried. That’s all I’ll say,” he said in a video before ducking into his car.Zamarripa, who had three tours in Iraq, was one of five officers who were shot and killed by a sniper during a Thursday night Black Lives Matter rally.He frequently posted on Twitter, often about his love for his city, country and favorite sports teams.Texas Rangers baseball player Joey Gallo says he and right fielder Nomar Mazara also posed for a photo with Zamarripa several months ago. In an Instagram post Saturday, the Rangers third baseman recalled being stopped by the officer, who was excited to get a picture with them.“‘I know who you guys are,’” Gallo recalled Zamarripa saying. “‘Joey Gallo and Nomar Mazara, can I get a picture with you guys please?’ It was definitely a first for me and Nomar to have an officer, a true hero, want to meet us.”Gallo asked that the public keep Zamarripa’s family, as well as all the other affected families and officers, in their prayers.“I’ll never forget how kind and down to Earth he was,” he said of Zamarripa. “We ended up having a 15 minute conversation about sports with him. He was an avid Rangers fan. But more importantly a great person, and family man.”Those wanting to help support the slain Dallas police officers and their families can learn more here."

PAUL, Minnesota ― Protests against police brutality that shut down I-94 for roughly five hours Saturday night began peacefully but eventually turned violent, ending with more than 100 people arrested and multiple people injured, including 21 officers.The clashes were among several that took place nationwide Saturday. Protests in cities like Dallas, Chicago, New York and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, followed a week where two black men ― one in suburban St. Paul and another in Baton Rouge ― where killed by police in highly publicized incidents. A sniper opened fire at a Dallas anti-violence protest, injuring multiple people and killing five officers. St. Paul police arrested and held 50 people on third-degree riot charges for occupying I-94 near the Dale Street exit on Saturday night and early Sunday morning. Hours later, they arrested 52 more for unlawful assembly after protesters had cleared the expressway and moved the demonstration several blocks toward the governor’s residence. They were cited and released. (Scroll down to see dramatic photos from the protest.)The protest broke through to the interstate shortly before 8 p.m., and largely gathered in the eastbound lane as police set up blockades.Protesters, which included several children, sang, chanted and called for justice in the death of Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by St. Anthony police during a Wednesday traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights.With the freeway shut down, members of the indigenous Mexica Tribe from the Kalpulli Yaocenoxtli dance group drummed in solidarity with protesters, a pickup truck carrying loudspeakers amplified chants and music from Marvin Gaye and Prince ― and police at one point thanked protesters for turning the music down.Mary Anne Quiroz, a dancer who was performing with her husband and their two children, offered a “fire dance” to the crowd to keep the energy high. “We need to keep feeding the passion, the motion. Especially when we’re feeling hopeless and [feeling] despair,” Quiroz said. She blew into a large conch shell as the crowd cheered. “The shell is like an old-school mobile phone,” she added. “It calls people, gets their attention.” But tensions grew after two hours of warnings from police to disperse or face the use of force.A small handful of protesters lit firecrackers or threw water bottles, chunks of concrete and construction rebar at police officers. St. Paul police later reported no officers were seriously injured, but said some were hit in the face with bottles and pelted with rocks. Several times, protesters quickly swarmed an aggressor acting against police to try to stop them or move them away from the front line.Yonci Jameson, 17, said “anarchists” have showed up to several anti-police violence protests in the past to purposely escalate tensions. “They were throwing s**t ― firecrackers, rocks. I don’t know who they were, but they weren’t affiliated with Black Lives Matter,” Jameson said. “They’re here to antagonize the cops and intimidate us ― but it ends up reflecting badly on Black Lives Matter.” Jameson was among the “two or three” protesters on the front line whom she said was hit with rubber bullets once police began using force to disperse the protest. (Police said only marking rounds were used.)Officers started by throwing inert smoke bombs and setting off flashbang grenades before resorting to chemical spray and nonlethal rounds. Antoine Martinneau, 31, was among the protesters watching from the hillside along the interstate to help people fleeing smoke and chemicals.He described the police’s response as typical of what he’s seen with other freeway takeover demonstrations. “They’re going to keep dispersing people. This is the last exit,” he said, as people poured through a hole in the fence separating the road to the on-ramp from the grassy encampment. A man identified by his friends as Tez was guided to the sidewalk after emerging from a cloud of smoke. “It f**king hurts!” he yelled as protesters called for milk to pour over his eyes. St. Paul police denied using tear gas during Saturday’s protests. Police spokesman Steve Linders said officers used “incredible restraint” and said the smoke police used was not a “chemical irritant.” Asked about the painful reactions from those claiming they were tear-gassed, Linders said: “Smoke doesn’t have that effect.” By about 10 p.m., the police’s ranks had swelled with the additional presence of Minnesota State Patrol and other units. Police with masks and batons moved to encircle protesters on two sides, forcing them toward the hill. A city bus was pulled onto the freeway to load in those who were arrested. As police stepped up crowd-dispersion tactics, protesters cleared the freeway around midnight to begin marching toward the governor’s residence.After protesters cleared the freeway, police remained on the street, flashed strobes, and fired marking rounds and other dispersion methods at the road flanking I-94 to clear lingering protesters — and curious neighbors who had emerged from their apartments that overlook the highway.Tom Goldstein, a 59-year-old St. Paul resident, was hit with a marking round after he walked over “to be a legal observer.”“Nothing in particular was going on, and [the police] shot at us,” Goldstein said. “We weren’t even doing anything.”He acknowledged that people on the pedestrian bridge had been throwing rocks and concrete onto officers, but questioned why police were targeting people in the neighborhood watching from their lawns and the parklet. “I really didn’t expect it to become this violent. I expected arrests ― arrests are fine. It’s not right to throw rocks and bottles at police, but then go arrest people,” he said. “This is not Kent State,” he added. “You don’t just start firing into a crowd.” St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman, who had previously praised the peaceful protests and attended a rally in honor of Castile, on Sunday condemned the violence against police as “shameful.” “It doesn’t honor anyone’s memory ... including Philando Castile’s,” Coleman said. Until Saturday, St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell’s department had previously arrested just one person for vandalism blocks from a protest at the governor’s residence.“This is the first time in my 28 years we have observed this level of violence toward our public servants,” Axtell said. “It’s really a disgrace.”Goldstein, who described himself as supportive of the police and friends with a lot of cops ― including Axtell ― said he was disappointed with how officers responded Saturday. “It’s usually not good PR to fire on the people who support you,” Goldstein said. “And they’re going to dismiss it the next day as just protesters, and not doing anything to repair this relationship in the neighborhood.” Several neighbors and onlookers who lingered walked up and down the police line.

PAUL, Minnesota ― Protests against police brutality that shut down I-94 for roughly five hours Saturday night began peacefully but eventually turned violent, ending with more than 100 people arrested and multiple people injured, including 21 officers.The clashes were among several that took place nationwide Saturday. Protests in cities like Dallas, Chicago, New York and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, followed a week where two black men ― one in suburban St. Paul and another in Baton Rouge ― where killed by police in highly publicized incidents. A sniper opened fire at a Dallas anti-violence protest, injuring multiple people and killing five officers. St. Paul police arrested and held 50 people on third-degree riot charges for occupying I-94 near the Dale Street exit on Saturday night and early Sunday morning. Hours later, they arrested 52 more for unlawful assembly after protesters had cleared the expressway and moved the demonstration several blocks toward the governor’s residence. They were cited and released. (Scroll down to see dramatic photos from the protest.)The protest broke through to the interstate shortly before 8 p.m., and largely gathered in the eastbound lane as police set up blockades.Protesters, which included several children, sang, chanted and called for justice in the death of Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by St. Anthony police during a Wednesday traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights.With the freeway shut down, members of the indigenous Mexica Tribe from the Kalpulli Yaocenoxtli dance group drummed in solidarity with protesters, a pickup truck carrying loudspeakers amplified chants and music from Marvin Gaye and Prince ― and police at one point thanked protesters for turning the music down.Mary Anne Quiroz, a dancer who was performing with her husband and their two children, offered a “fire dance” to the crowd to keep the energy high. “We need to keep feeding the passion, the motion. Especially when we’re feeling hopeless and [feeling] despair,” Quiroz said. She blew into a large conch shell as the crowd cheered. “The shell is like an old-school mobile phone,” she added. “It calls people, gets their attention.” But tensions grew after two hours of warnings from police to disperse or face the use of force.A small handful of protesters lit firecrackers or threw water bottles, chunks of concrete and construction rebar at police officers. St. Paul police later reported no officers were seriously injured, but said some were hit in the face with bottles and pelted with rocks. Several times, protesters quickly swarmed an aggressor acting against police to try to stop them or move them away from the front line.Yonci Jameson, 17, said “anarchists” have showed up to several anti-police violence protests in the past to purposely escalate tensions. “They were throwing s**t ― firecrackers, rocks. I don’t know who they were, but they weren’t affiliated with Black Lives Matter,” Jameson said. “They’re here to antagonize the cops and intimidate us ― but it ends up reflecting badly on Black Lives Matter.” Jameson was among the “two or three” protesters on the front line whom she said was hit with rubber bullets once police began using force to disperse the protest. (Police said only marking rounds were used.)Officers started by throwing inert smoke bombs and setting off flashbang grenades before resorting to chemical spray and nonlethal rounds. Antoine Martinneau, 31, was among the protesters watching from the hillside along the interstate to help people fleeing smoke and chemicals.He described the police’s response as typical of what he’s seen with other freeway takeover demonstrations. “They’re going to keep dispersing people. This is the last exit,” he said, as people poured through a hole in the fence separating the road to the on-ramp from the grassy encampment. A man identified by his friends as Tez was guided to the sidewalk after emerging from a cloud of smoke. “It f**king hurts!” he yelled as protesters called for milk to pour over his eyes. St. Paul police denied using tear gas during Saturday’s protests. Police spokesman Steve Linders said officers used “incredible restraint” and said the smoke police used was not a “chemical irritant.” Asked about the painful reactions from those claiming they were tear-gassed, Linders said: “Smoke doesn’t have that effect.” By about 10 p.m., the police’s ranks had swelled with the additional presence of Minnesota State Patrol and other units. Police with masks and batons moved to encircle protesters on two sides, forcing them toward the hill. A city bus was pulled onto the freeway to load in those who were arrested. As police stepped up crowd-dispersion tactics, protesters cleared the freeway around midnight to begin marching toward the governor’s residence.After protesters cleared the freeway, police remained on the street, flashed strobes, and fired marking rounds and other dispersion methods at the road flanking I-94 to clear lingering protesters — and curious neighbors who had emerged from their apartments that overlook the highway.Tom Goldstein, a 59-year-old St. Paul resident, was hit with a marking round after he walked over “to be a legal observer.”“Nothing in particular was going on, and [the police] shot at us,” Goldstein said. “We weren’t even doing anything.”He acknowledged that people on the pedestrian bridge had been throwing rocks and concrete onto officers, but questioned why police were targeting people in the neighborhood watching from their lawns and the parklet. “I really didn’t expect it to become this violent. I expected arrests ― arrests are fine. It’s not right to throw rocks and bottles at police, but then go arrest people,” he said. “This is not Kent State,” he added. “You don’t just start firing into a crowd.” St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman, who had previously praised the peaceful protests and attended a rally in honor of Castile, on Sunday condemned the violence against police as “shameful.” “It doesn’t honor anyone’s memory ... including Philando Castile’s,” Coleman said. Until Saturday, St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell’s department had previously arrested just one person for vandalism blocks from a protest at the governor’s residence.“This is the first time in my 28 years we have observed this level of violence toward our public servants,” Axtell said. “It’s really a disgrace.”Goldstein, who described himself as supportive of the police and friends with a lot of cops ― including Axtell ― said he was disappointed with how officers responded Saturday. “It’s usually not good PR to fire on the people who support you,” Goldstein said. “And they’re going to dismiss it the next day as just protesters, and not doing anything to repair this relationship in the neighborhood.” Several neighbors and onlookers who lingered walked up and down the police line. Several young men taunted cops and yelled, “F**k the police!” Michael Anderson, 55, a Minneapolis resident, said he’s lost count of how many times the city’s police “have called me n****r in the past 40 years.”But he admonished the men hurling insults at the cops as acting “ridiculous.” “He ain’t thinking with an adult mind,” Anderson said of a young man walking by.

It wasn’t until recent observations over 13 nights and about 14 hours, using Hawaii’s Gemini-North telescope and the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph, that researchers say they were able to get a clear enough picture of its infrared spectrum.The spectrum not only confirms, with “the best evidence,” that objects that cold would have water clouds but also provides new insight into this outer star as well as into Jupiter, Andrew Skemer, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said in a press release this week.“Our spectrum shows that WISE 0855 is dominated by water vapor and clouds, with an overall appearance that is strikingly similar to Jupiter,” Skemer, who co-authored the report, said. “Now that we have a spectrum, we can really start thinking about what’s going on in this object.”In addition to abundant water vapor, Jupiter and WISE 0855 also share similar temperatures — WISE 0855 being around 250 Kelvin or -9 degrees Fahrenheit, and Jupiter at 130 Kelvin.“WISE 0855 is our first opportunity to study an extrasolar planetary-mass object that is nearly as cold as our own gas giants,” Skemer said.The brown dwarf likely has a less turbulent atmosphere than Jupiter, however. That’s because it does not heavily absorb the toxic gas phosphine like Jupiter does, the report explains. It’s also about five times the mass of Jupiter.“The spectrum allows us to investigate dynamical and chemical properties that have long been studied in Jupiter’s atmosphere, but this time on an extrasolar world,” Skemer noted.The atmospheric findings appear to further blur the line between planets and brown dwarfs, which are often called “failed stars.”That’s because they are smaller than typical stars, though larger than planets, and therefore unable to sustain the nuclear fusion that makes regular stars shine, NASA explains on its website.This article has been updated with additional information on brown dwarfs.

Earlier projections had shown it was within their grasp for the first time since 1989.Nevertheless, the overall victory will still bolster Abe’s grip over the conservative party that he led back to power in 2012 promising to reboot the economy with hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and reforms.Any attempt to revise the constitution will still be politically fraught and LDP heavyweights have suggested that amending the pacifist Article 9 would not be the first priority.Abe told a TV broadcaster it was too early to talk about specific revisions to the constitution and his No.2 in the party said separately that talks with the opposition were needed.“I have two more years to my term (as LDP president) and this is a goal of the LDP, so I want to address it calmly,” Abe said.In Japan, some financial market players fear trying to amend the constitution could divert Abe’s energy away from reviving the stuttering economy.“The key question will be whether he can carry out (economic) structural reforms,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. “If Abe fails to do so despite the political freedom he has gained, that will be negative for foreign investors’ appetite for Japanese stocks.”Some voters who backed Abe’s LDP also said the economy’s health was their biggest concern.“Especially since I see economic growth as the priority, I have little hope for the opposition parties,” said Yoshihiko Takeda, a 36-year-old IT company employee.HOW BIG A MANDATE?Abe had cast the election as a referendum on “Abenomics.” With signs the strategy is failing, the government plans to compile a post-election stimulus package that could exceed 10 trillion yen ($99 billion).Abe declined to say how big the package might be. Economists worry the government will choose big-ticket infrastructure projects rather than implement tough structural reforms.Abe said he would reshuffle his cabinet but did not say when or how. There has been speculation that Abe might replace Finance Minister Taro Aso, 75, among others.His minister for Okinawa, Aiko Shimajiri, lost her seat, along with Justice Minister Mitsuhide Iwaki.The loss in Okinawa is a slap at a U.S.-Japan plan to relocate a controversial U.S.-Marines airbase on the island, reluctant host to the bulk of America’s military forces in Japan.Abe said he had won a mandate for his economic policies in the election, although the assertion could be weakened by low turnout. “We were given approval for our mandate to powerfully pursue Abenomics. We’d like to continue with our efforts to achieve what we’ve promised,” he said on TV.Kyodo news agency put turnout at about 54 percent, a bit above the record low of 52.61 percent seen in the last upper house poll three years ago.The opposition Democratic Party linked up with three smaller parties including the Japanese Communist Party to try to stop the pro-constitutional reform camp getting a super majority. Abe’s coalition already has a super-majority in the lower house.Conservatives see the constitution as a humiliating symbol of Japan’s defeat in World War Two. Its admirers consider it the source of post-war peace and democracy. Revising the charter needs the approval of two-thirds in both houses of parliament and a majority in a public referendum.“We think the constitution is something that puts limits on power, but sadly, that’s not what the LDP’s (revised draft) does,” Yukio Edano, Democratic Party Secretary General, said on TV. “If there is no common agreement on this point, then there is no platform on which we can debate individual articles.”Surveys show most voters see no need to revise the constitution and the LDP’s dovish coalition partner, Komeito, is reluctant to change its pacifist Article 9. The party’s secretary-general, Yoshihisa Inoue, said on TV that views in the party on possible changes had “not come together” yet.Still, Abe, whose deeper agenda has long centered on revising the U.S.-drafted charter, may be tempted to push ahead.“With these numbers ... he (Abe) is going to want to see what he can achieve,” said Columbia University professor emeritus Gerry Curtis. “That means less attention to the economy and a lot of spinning over the constitution.”"

But with a pound of lobster sometimes costing up to $8 in grocery stores, it’s possible they may have forked out as much as $4,800 on the gesture. The Huffington Post has reached out for comment.Venerable Dan said the monks were not trying to convince people to become vegetarian or vegan, but instead hoped it would spread a sense of compassion.“This whole purpose for us is to cultivate this compassion toward others,” he told CBC News. “It doesn’t have to be lobsters, it can be worms, flies, any animals, drive slower so we don’t run over little critters on the street.”Other Buddhist monks performed a similar act off the coast of northern Massachusetts in 2011, when they also freed 600 pounds of lobsters into the ocean.“Even if they get captured again, they’ve had a longer life,” Wendy Cook,  former director at the Kurukulla Center for Tibetan Buddhist Studies in Medford, told Reuters at the time."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Preston Gilstrap, 64, was a Dallas police officer for over 41 years before he retired in 2013. Earlier this week, he saw the two brutal videos of police officers killing black men ― Philando Castile in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana ― that shook the nation. And Friday morning, Gilstrap, who is black, woke up to news of the horror that had visited his hometown: at a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest Thursday night over the killing of Castile and Sterling, a lone gunman opened fire, killing five Dallas police officers and wounding nine other people. “My heart has been totally torn out of my chest by both violence perpetrated on officers and violence perpetrated by officers,” Gilstrap told The Huffington Post Friday. “These officers were there to protect the protesters and make sure their expression of discontent and freedom of speech were protected,” added Gilstrap, who has long advocated for police reform. “They were taking selfies [with the protesters.] There was nothing wrong with the protest.” Malik Aziz, an active-duty deputy chief in the Dallas Police Department and the national chairman of the National Black Police Association ― which also advocates for police reform ― said Friday that “the atmosphere is somber” in the police department right now. “And one of disbelief.”“Our hearts are very heavy,” he said. “The citizens here have shown so much love and support.” “In 27 years of law enforcement my heart has never been this heavy and I have never felt this way,” he said. “This is the worst day in our history and among the worst in our nation’s history of policing.”“I tell officers to take your time. Officers are human beings. We are hurting. We need healing. But we are professionals. We are now saying, ‘we are going to make it.’” Corey Pegues, a former deputy inspector in the New York Police Department and author of the book Once a Cop: The Street, The Law, Two Worlds, One Man, said, “Every black cop in America was looking at their TV this week and watching the execution of Castile and Sterling and they were feeling really bad about being a cop because that’s not what being a cop is. These weren’t mistakes. These were executions.” In the meantime, he added, black police officers “have family members getting stopped and frisked and wrongfully locked up, and then wake up in the morning and see that 10 cops are shot.” Some politicians and pundits were quick on Friday to paint the triple tragedies of Minneapolis, Baton Rouge and Dallas as a kind of tit-for-tat battle between law enforcement and the police reform movement. The New York Post’s front page screamed “CIVIL WAR” and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) blamed Black Lives Matter protesters for the shooting. But the experience of black police officers exposes such narratives as absurd. After all, black police officers naturally want black civilians to be policed fairly and without brutality, and they also want to ensure that their fellow officers ― their friends and colleagues ― aren’t killed in the line of duty. “There is way too much blame to go around,” said Aziz, the Dallas police department deputy chief. “After the finger-pointing we need to sit together and commit to open dialogue for progression. We cannot operate on the false foundation of us versus them. This is all about us.” Before the Dallas shootings, a black police officer in Ohio, Nakia Jones, gave an emotional speech on Facebook live that has since been watched over 7 million times. Jones, who works in Warrensville Heights, near Cleveland, had watched the video of Castile being shot during a traffic stop in St. Paul and was deeply disturbed by it.She said that for the first time, she was able to see a police brutality incident through the eyes of a civilian. “So I’m looking at [the video], and it tore me up because I got to see what you all see,” she said. “If I wasn’t a police officer and I wasn’t on the inside, I would be saying, ‘Look at this racist stuff. Look at this.’ And it hurt me.”“If you are white and you’re working in a black community and you are racist, you need to be ashamed of yourself,” she added, her voice rising. “You stood up there and took an oath. If this is not where you want to work, then you need to take your behind somewhere else.”But Jones said she still wants to be a cop. “I am my brothers’ and my sisters’ keeper,” she said. “That’s why I’m going to keep this uniform on.Ronald Hampton was a police officer in Washington, D.C., for 24 years, many of those during the crack epidemic of the 1980s. He’s now retired and works with the Black Law Enforcement Association. He said he knows what it feels like both to experience systemic racism and to lose a fellow officer. “When a white colleague was shot and killed, then of course I felt sympathy for him and his family,” he said. “But him getting killed didn’t erase the racism and discrimination I was experiencing in the police department. It didn’t erase [how police treated black communities]. Those are two separate things. One doesn’t eliminate the other. You have to deal with it.”What happened in Dallas, he said, is the result of decades of failing to hold cops accountable for acts of brutality. “People who kill police officers go to jail,” he said. “Police officers who kill people don’t go to jail.”“We’ve been talking about reform all the way back to the ‘80s,” he continued. “We saw these killings and Rodney King. We’ve been talking about reform and it hasn’t worked. There wouldn’t be Alton or Castile. There would be no Trayvon. It’s a lack of reform that has created the environment for police to keep doing what they do, without accountability.” According to Damon Jones, a black corrections officer in Westchester County, New York, who also works for the Black Law Enforcement Association, police commissioners and politicians only “pay lip service” to comprehensive police reform. Meanwhile, “all these black men are still getting shot in 2016.” “People have lost faith,” he said. “Then you have shootings of police officers and the first thing they do is point the finger at people voicing their opinion on the justice system and how black men are getting treated. And then you have crazies, with their own agenda, that use this conflict for their own agenda, not to bring law enforcement and the community together, but for their own sick reasons.” “Black law enforcement is caught in the middle,” he added. “We understand the issues in black communities and the dangers that law enforcement face. It’s up to black law enforcement to fix this and be more vocal on this issue.” Pegues, the former NYPD officer, agrees. He said “black cops are standing on eggshells right now. They want to speak out but they’re afraid to speak out for fear of backlash.” “My advice is to black cops is specific: it’s to collectively come out and speak about the various injustices in their departments,” he said. If they don’t put pressure on their police departments to make reforms, Pegues fears the U.S. will be doomed to a vicious cycle: police kill black people, leading to outrage and large protests, which in turn leads to deranged, lone wolf shooters who will start “plucking off cops.” He pointed to Ismaaiyl Brinsley, the man who killed two NYPD officers in Brooklyn in 2014 before taking his own life. Brinsley had posted to Instagram before the shooting that he planned to put “wings on pigs.” He added the hashtags #EricGarner and #MichaelBrown, both unarmed black men who died at the hands of police months before and whose deaths sparked massive protests across the country. Similarly, the Dallas shooter, a 25-year-old Army veteran named Micah Xavier Johnson, reportedly said that he wanted to kill white people, and in particular, white police officers. Johnson was killed by police after a long standoff. “We’re at a critical point right now,” Pegues said. “Action needs to be done. The various police officers need to discipline these rogue officers.”“We can’t keep having this.” Outside the Dallas Police Department on Saturday, Det. Ira Carter held a rose he received from a supporter. Nearby, two cop cars were smothered with flowers and signs of support.“It’s tough to deal with, especially when you’ve lost officers you work with,” Carter said of the past couple days. “Looking out and seeing all the people who have come out to offer their support, it means a lot to us.”Carter, who is black, said he respected the anti-police sentiments shared by some protesters — the same protesters his fellow officers lost their lives protecting.“As police, we took an oath,” Carter said. “No matter who the person is, we took an oath to treat everybody equally.”“We’re taking strides to try and do what’s right,” he added. “It’s not perfect, but we’re taking strides.”Sebastian Murdock contributed reporting from Dallas.

Officers fired tear gas and charged at dozens of people trying to break into the area, near the Eiffel Tower, sparking chaotic scenes in the French capital. Around 90,000 fans watched the match in the specially designated zone that featured an enormous 4,500-square-foot screen showing France and Portugal face off in the final of the soccer tournament. Some supporters weren’t able to get into the zone before it reached capacity, however, and small groups of people repeatedly tried to break into the area, Reuters reported.Riot police tried to disperse the crowds outside the zone throughout the match, at one point using water cannons to try to turn them back.Video posted on social media showed people hurling projectiles at a line of shielded riot police before the officers charged forward.Paris had readied over 5,000 police ahead of the final amid heightened security fears surrounding the high-profile event. The city suffered a series of terrorist attacks last year.Fan zones, where thousands have gathered in tight spaces, were specifically highlighted as areas that needed high security. The U.S. State Department in May called for citizens to use caution when attending the tournament, as the zones could be a potential terror target.Photos from Sunday’s clashes depicted scenes of burning garbage fires and clouds of tear gas against the backdrop of the city’s landmarks."

Although it doesn’t look like much of a hit on Ronaldo, watching the challenge in real time is brutal. Completely out-of-control despite trying to slow down his momentum, Payet ran Ronaldo over. And only in the seventh minute of the match! Desperate to compete and lead his nation to their first major international trophy, Ronaldo received treatment on his knee and tried to play through the pain. Essentially playing on one leg, Ronaldo dribbled once with clear difficulty before calling it quits and summoning the stretcher. At the Stade de France just north of Paris, France’s home fans hissed and whistled as Ronaldo’s injury repeatedly stopped the game ― one that France started out sharply, pressuring the Portuguese defense from the first whistle. Sitting on the ground in despair, Ronaldo let the tears flow ― perhaps partly in pain from the injury, and partly in pain from the devastating feeling of leaving a final. The superstar forward was under pressure to play well and make amends for Portugal’s upset loss to Greece at the Euro 2004 final on home soil. Sadly for Ronaldo, the dream of leading Portugal on the pitch to their first trophy will have to wait until the 2018 World Cup in Russia. UPDATE: (5:44 p.m.) Without Ronaldo, Portugal actually beat France in extra time 1-0 to win the Euro 2016. Watching from the sidelines, Ronaldo was overjoyed. Once again, there were tears:"

Snow as ""carrying the same torch"" as Bernie Sanders.",2016-07-10,"“A lot of young people are excited about me,"" Misty K. Snow said. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Misty K. Snow became the first major party transgender candidate for the U.S. Senate when she won the Democratic nomination in Utah on June 28. And no matter what happens in November – when she has a tough fight up against Utah Republican incumbent Mike Lee, though Democrats have been a bit more competitive in the deep red state lately ― her nomination is a sign of the times and a symbol of a new generation in politics.That’s because Snow would not only be the first trans person elected to the U.S. Senate if she won (and the first woman elected to the Senate from Utah); the 30-year-old would be the first millennial elected to the Senate as well. And she won the Democratic nomination – beating an opponent with far greater resources, who outspent her four to one – on the energy and progressive values of millennials who’ve turned out in huge for Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid.For those younger voters, who’ve grown up with LGBT rights as a civil rights issue of their time, Snow’s identity is just another fact of life about someone who speaks to them on a host of issues about which they share a passion.“I didn’t have as many resources as my opponent, and he started his race six months sooner,” Snow told me in an interview on SiriusXM Progress. “He had more volunteers, more time. He knew more people and had about four times as much money as I did. But we were able to get my message out and it resonated with voters. Talking about raising the minimum wage, paid maternity leave. We were talking about clean energy. We were talking about affordable college and affordable health care. And those issues really resonated with voters.” “A lot of young people are excited about me, young people across the nation,” she continued. “A lot of Bernie Sanders supporters. They see me as carrying the same torch that Bernie was carrying ― someone who wants to fight for that same progressive agenda.”Snow works as a cashier in a grocery store and grew up in a lower income family, aspects of her life that she said connect with many Utah voters.“I think that coming from that kind of background resonates with people,” Snow explained. “They know I have empathy. They understand that I know what it’s like to be poor, that I can relate to the lower class, the working class, the middle class. Which is something that’s really missing in Congress because most of Congress ― they’re millionaires, they’re bankers, they’re lawyers, they’re business owners...They don’t know what it’s like to scrape by, paycheck to paycheck.”Snow, of course, sees the significance of the history she’s making as a transgender politician ― in making that history, she’s joined by Misty Plowwright, a trans candidate running for a House seat in Colorado, who also recently won the Democratic nomination― and the battles ahead for LGBT people.“We need full protections for LGBT people in housing, employment, public accommodations, with no exemptions,” she said, vowing to fight for full equality. While that work is hugely important and shows the struggle moving forward, by simply winning a major party nomination in deeply red Utah, Misty K. Snow is a bright reminder of how far we’ve come."

One officer, armed with an assault weapon, deliberately aimed the gun at protesters and journalists, forcing them to retreat. HuffPost senior crime reporter David Lohr was among them.Lohr arrived in Baton Rouge earlier this week to help capture moments from the Black Lives Matter protests that took over the city’s streets. He launched a live-stream on the HuffPost Black Voices Facebook page around 11 p.m. that captured some tense moments, including police making several arrests and one protester getting shocked by a stun gun. In one jarring moment, Lohr captured an officer pointing her assault rifle at protesters ― and at him. “An officer just pointed a machine gun at me,” Lohr says in the live-stream. “I’m not quite sure what that female officer was doing; she pointed an assault rifle at us.” Watch the moment around the 4:45 mark:Baton Rouge protesters were outraged over the officers’ actions on Saturday night, including prominent Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, who was arrested at the protest during a moment he captured live on Periscope. Prior to his arrest, Mckesson tweeted about the demonstration and described how police were “provoking protesters.” Other demonstrators sent similar messages.“They’re trying to kill us. We are peaceful,” one protester, who didn’t give her name, told Lohr in the video. “They want a reason to shoot us down in the street, but we’re not gonna give them one. We’re gonna remain peaceful. But we’re out here and we’re not afraid.” “They want to be able to say we’re savages. Never,” she added. “We’re warriors.” Hundreds gathered for protests in Baton Rouge, and cities across America, to protest the recent police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile ― and declare that black lives matter. Protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” and “F*ck the police” as they marched through Baton Rouge, where Sterling was killed days earlier. Officers blocked off roads to prevent marchers from going down the highway and forcefully arrested those who failed to move.“One thing I noticed today as opposed to yesterday is that [cops] were certainly more willing to pull their firearms out,” Lohr observed in the video after things seemed to have calmed down a bit. Lohr, who was warned to “back up” and “move out of the road,” headed to the Baton Rouge Police Department, where more demonstrators were still gathered. He launched another live-stream on the Black Voices Facebook page to document those moments: Lohr stayed around the area into the early morning to help kids and college students pick up trash at the protest site.Hundreds of protesters spent the night in jail, and thousands of others are still reeling from the chaos that erupted both in Baton Rouge and in cities like St. Paul, Minnesota, the site of Castile’s death. HuffPost reporter Kim Bellware captured the unrest and police violence there in a series of tweets.More protests across the country are expected in the days ahead. "

Miranda Jr. and Luz Towns-Miranda, both of whom salsa-danced the night away at the “Hamilton” after-party at the R Lounge in Times Square, which Hennessy hosted for the cast and notables like Jennifer Lopez. “It’s an incredible feeling for a mom to know that her son has accomplished at least his dreams, because this is such a difficult field,” Towns-Miranda told The Huffington Post at the after-party. “And for him to reach this level of success is beyond what even he imagined.”But the 36-year-old Puerto Rican’s genius didn’t come overnight. His mother can attest to that, and so can a few adorable childhood videos posted online. “From the time he was tiny, he was always playing with recordings and with songs and with a video camera,” Towns-Miranda told HuffPost. “And we encouraged him to do whatever he wanted to do and we participated with him in some of the activities.”Towns-Miranda recalled the moment she fully realized that little Lin had something truly special to offer onstage.“I’ve been proud of him since the time he was tiny, but I remember going to a Christmas concert once and throughout the concert he embodied the music and he had this aura around him,” she gushed. “And I remember leaving that church and wondering, ‘Did anybody else just see the show I saw? Because it was amazing.’ So he brings that magnetism to the stage every time and I saw it when he was about 10 years old.”Towns-Miranda, who was born in Puerto Rico, recognizes the importance of her son writing musicals with his Latino heritage in mind, particularly his first Tony-winning production, “In The Heights.” “It goes to show how smart he was,” she said. “He really analyzed all the plays that were out there and [when he got] permission to write something about his life now, he knew if he didn’t write it he would not be able to do anything. Because what was being written by others wasn’t anything that he would be able to be part of.”The “Hamilton” after-party may have marked the end of an era for the show, but the cast was nothing but energy and smiles as they danced, ate and toasted in honor of the memorable night. Miranda himself made a grand entrance on the red carpet, wearing a Muhammad Ali shirt, and showing off his new look sans Hamilton ponytail. During the celebration, Miranda tweeted out a photo of locks of his cut hair with a simple message: “Teach ‘em how to say goodbye ...” "

An hour later, a second link appeared in my inbox: it was to NPR's version of the same story. ""It's all over the web,"" I was told. Jamie Shupe, who had lived in western PA for a short time before moving with their wife Sandy out to Oregon a few years ago, had successfully petitioned their new home state to be legally registered as a third, non-binary gender -- reportedly the first granting of such a petition in the U.S. (a handful of other nations had already made it an option).After a ""Holy merde!"" on seeing someone I knew making international headlines, I began reflecting on the future of the male/female gender binary; and before too long my thoughts returned to an idea I'd been mulling over for some time: the important role that the word ""cisgender"" is playing in our radical rethinking of the binary, and ultimately gender itself.On first glance, ""cisgender"" seems an unlikely agent of revolutionary change. The word is a neologism a mere two decades old, after all, and it has gained broad currency only within the past few years, being chosen for inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary just last summer, for example. And unlike some of its fellow 2015 OED inductees -- the in-your-face ""Masshole,"" or ""Twitterati"" with its air of blithe jet-setter worldliness -- ""cisgender"" is, well, a textbook example of stolid, musty textbookese. Moreover, the word is vulnerable to the criticism that it reinforces the binary rather than undermining it, since it denotes someone whose sense of their gender identity conforms to their biological sex -- a girl who is assigned female at birth and vice versa -- someone, in short, who doesn't identify as transgender.First impressions can be deceiving, however, as the vigorous pushback the word has met with from some quarters since it began seeping into mainstream discourse suggests. The sources of this antipathy are varied: some members of the LGBTQ community have perceived in it an unwanted form of privilege being foisted on them, for example, while some (self-styled) feminists and haters on the right reject the word because it gives legitimacy to the trans condition, the existence of which they continue to deny. The common thread running through these reactions, though, is the sense that the ideas sprouting from or fallow in the semantic patch demarcated by ""cisgender"" pose a threat to the existing order.And the truth is: they do.As trans advocates and allies have pointed out, the primary menace the word poses is to a deeply entrenched form of privilege: the right to think of one's gender identity as ""normal"" -- and not to give it a second thought. What's at stake here? In the first place, when people who are ""gender conforming"" insist on their normality, they communicate to those of us who aren't that we're abnormal; and since the word ""normal"" carries such strong positive connotations -- most people, if asked, would surely want to be classified that way -- its opposite, by implication, carries equally strong negative connotations (""sick,"" ""deviant,"" ""unnatural,"" ""evil,"" etc.). To describe one's condition as ""normal,"" moreover, is to tacitly assert that it needs no explanation or justification: normality = normative, that which by general consensus should be, a status inherent in the words' common derivation from the Latin root norma, ""rule."" It's only the abnormal that, because it represents a deviation from what's generally held to be healthy, natural, good (Latin ab-, ""away from""), must be accounted for, and accounted for in light of the ""normal.""The way in which the word ""cisgender"" threatens these largely unconscious assumptions is by serving as a simple tool for articulating them. As College of William & Mary English prof Paula Blank succinctly put it in a September 2014 article in The Atlantic, ""'Cisgender' suggests a commonality among transgender and non-transgender people...It tells us that we all experience some kind of relationship between our bodies and our selves, whatever that relationship may be."" It's the notion of ""commonality"" that's key here. The word ""cisgender"" counters the hierarchical, exclusionary, stigmatizing relationship inherent in the binary normal/abnormal with the implicit assertion that none of us can take the ""relationship between our bodies and our selves"" for granted because ""we all experience some kind of relationship."" A number of important corollaries follow from this assertion: that being ""gender conforming"" is its own condition, and not simply the lack of a condition, and thus is in need of being accounted for every bit as much as gender nonconformity is; that what is ""normal"" is having a relationship to gender, not a particular type of gender identity; as such, that ""conformity"" denotes a statistical relationship (think of the bell curve), not an ethical choice, and the different manifestations of gender nonconformity are simply normal variations within the universal human trait gender, rather than forms of moral or social deviance.If this conceptual shift doesn't seem all that seismic, the practical implications that follow from it are shaking some foundations. Most importantly, the stark social, legal, and economic inequities still too often visited on those of us who are gender nonconforming lose any pretense to being mere expressions of the natural order of things. Put another way, firing or evicting us, and in general denying us basic civil rights and protections, can no longer be justified on the grounds of our being a threat to others simply because of who we are. It's this implication that's provoking the strongest pushback, notably in the form of the many ""bathroom bills"" that have popped up in state after state over the past year. The proffered rationales for these stoopid bills tend to be couched in plain-vanilla coded language like ""privacy rights;"" but the fears that conservative lawmakers are exploiting to push them through revolve around the thoroughly discredited right-wing fantasy of trans women as sexual predators, the implication being that because of who we are, we must be quarantined, aka made illegal -- the real end game of this legislation.Fortunately, the changing views about gender conformity and nonconformity are already making it more difficult in a legal context to appeal to such ""common sense"" positions. By the same token, as the widespread outcry against anti-trans legislation in North Carolina and elsewhere attests, the de-normalizing of gender conformity is enabling more and more businesses to recognize in us potential customers and employees, and more and more people to think of us as neighbors and co-workers -- and ultimately fellow human beings.These and other sweeping changes, I've argued, inhere in the basic conceptual shift the coining of the word ""cisgender"" helped bring into focus. For the most part, however, these changes have only begun to manifest themselves, and we continue to face uphill struggles in many areas, notably in our ongoing effort to secure civil rights protections at the federal level (the Equality Act of 2015 having stalled in a stalemated Congress). And then there are all the quotidian changes that will only come with the gradual de-stigmatizing of gender nonconformity: the willingness of our gender conforming counterparts to see us as potential romantic partners (outside the realm of kink), or to mix freely with us in social settings (without our needing to be stealth), or to pass us in the street without feeling the need -- and presuming the entitlement -- to harass us or even just cast disdainful glances our way (as I'm reminded on occasion on my daily walks when my gaze meets the eyes of certain of my neighbors).I have faith that, barring some catastrophic changes in our societal climate, the seeds in cisgender's fertile semantic field will continue to sprout, grow, and bear fruit. But the full harvest will be some time in coming yet."

Cinespace Chicago Film Studios has a history rich with stories of family and friends coming together, in good and bad times, to make great things happen. It all began in 1968 when Nikolaos Mirkopoulos, a trained electrician from Greece, decided to embark to Canada to start a family business. He would soon be joined by his brothers Larry and Steve together forming Torontario Contractors and giving new life to landmark institutions across the greater Toronto area.  These upgrades included repurposing structures as film studios and in 1988, Nikolaos decided to develop the first large-scale film production studio in Canada called Cinespace. As the business grew, three more studios were opened in Toronto.  It was at a family wedding in 2008 that Alex Pissois, a Chicago nephew of Nikolaos and at the time a real estate broker, found himself sharing with his uncle the unfortunate news about the faltering economy in the United States and the effects of the Great Recession. Like all families, when times get tough, you rely on each other to pull through and it was then that Nikolaos suggested that Alex help him open a new branch of the family business in Chicago.  ""It was a life-changer for me and my family,"" Alex recalls in an interview with Crain's Chicago Business.  The two men ventured into Chicago to carry out their mission and eventually developed the family business on a 50-acre industrial site, helping revitalize the city's television and film industry. Since its opening, Alex has overseen productions for such shows like Chicago Fire and Chicago P.D. as well as for films like Jupiter Ascending, Transformers 4 and Divergent (which later grossed over $288M at the box office in 2014.) AT CINESPACE CHiCAGO -- PHOTO COURTESY OF IRENE MICHAELSThe Chicago studio is now expanding and building a 6-8,000 square-foot tank for underwater filming and has added 10 sound stages within the last year. Cinespace is currently seeking to open a back lot that would be used for sets to double as urban and city spots like Chinatown, a Parisian café, or even New York City's brownstones. As an added bonus, this would be the first type of film lot found outside of Hollywood.  Cinespace has not just contributed to movies, but also to the Chicago community, creating the equivalent of 4,200 full time jobs since 2014. ""You watch,"" Mr. Pissios told Crain's Chicago Business, ""this neighborhood is going to grow just the way it did in Toronto."" There's also been the development of interest by younger generations, especially students from DePaul who frequent the studios for film production classes.  Alex Pissois and his family have realized a dream of creating a film space and environment that benefit the lives of those involved as well as those whose community it took rooted in. On a personal note - meeting and talking to Alex was quite a refreshing experience. A man with a big heart who loves life and wants to give back to people is unusual in today's world. Who knows, maybe someday they will create a movie on his life accomplishments and have others value all his good deeds as we do here in Chicago. "

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81e282500008e013a169d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump will be the nominee of the Republican Party. How he got to be the leader of the Grand 'ole Party of Lincoln and Eisenhower is very important to understand for those who want to stop him from getting to the White House and redecorating it with 24‑carat gold accents and marble walls and ceiling -- or worse -- and positioning the bronze statue of Eros and Psyche at the Diplomatic Entrance. While the media and political analysts are writing the obituary of the Republican Party and predicting Trump's inevitable loss in November, I'm keen on illuminating his rise and why he might be able to win. In fact, if the Green Party's and the Libertarian Party's candidates are included in national polling, Clinton and Trump are only separated by the margin of error of 3-5 points. So if those opposed to Trump's election do not understand his capacity to bundle four separate messages about his candidacy and his vision for America -- two of which are contradictory -- then egg will be the new daily facial makeup for the pundits who previously declared Trump's candidacy dead on arrival a year ago.While the pundits are focused on the rift between Trump and the republican establishment, Trump remains laser focused on the rift between millions of voters and their government.FEAR and ANGER: Most observers understand that Trump is a conduit for the fear and anger crashing across America, although far too many believe he is the cause of it, which blinds them to the reality that millions and millions of voters are suffering. As I pointed out in my Huffington Post posting on April 20, 2016, Trump is not the cause of the fear and anger, but rather, the conditions under which millions of Americans live are the reason for such a tsunami of fear and anger spreading throughout the country.Trump's is an example of the power of unhappiness -- despair in many areas of America -- to drive and demand change. Of course, his role has not been to cause the unhappiness. He simply reflects back to voters their unhappiness with things as they are and with the establishment that is desperately trying to keep change out of the hallways of congress and out of the corridors of the executive branch.Even a cursory look at the recent polling on people's attitudes and the lack of their trust for the basic institutions of America makes it clear that there are reasons to be afraid and angry. But unfortunately, Trump throws his own brand of DRUMPF gasoline on the fire that's already been burning for years. In 2010, I wrote about the perfect storm of fear and anger rolling across America.When over 50 percent of young people between the ages of 18 and 29 believe the American dream is dead, then the future looks as dismal for them as the present is for millions of older voters.Trump sensed early-on what so many others did not: that millions of primary voters were ready to vote for anyone who seemingly listened to and then reflected and embraced their plight and their earnest demand to overthrow the establishment and make a dramatic change.GETTING SCREWED: That while Trump is a conduit for these feelings of unhappiness and despair, he's also articulating the feeling that millions and millions of Americans have about getting screwed. Screwed while a very small percentage of the population grows wealthier and while the disparity -- actually a giant gulf between the wealthy and even the middle class -- is staggeringly wide and deep. In fact, today the top 1% own over 50% of the wealth. The bottom 80% own less than 7%. As a result, it's not surprising that the majority of Americans no longer believe the American dream is alive and possible for their children; tomorrow will not be better for their children than it was for them today.It's like Reverend Ike, the pastor of decades ago, who told his flock that they would never have the cars, the clothes, the homes, the boats, the women that he had. So it was best, he said, to give him the money and then live vicariously through his life. A bit of an abomination of ""prosperity theology,"" which basically admonishes ""forget about the pie in the sky; get yours here and now."" Reverend Ike is famous for his ""blessing plan"" that urged listeners to send him money and then he would bless them. He reassured the listeners that those who sent him greenbacks would be more prosperous. The only difference between Trump and Reverend Ike is that Trump is asking for votes and promising a blessing in return.SCREWING the SYSTEM: Trump is using his successful gaming of the system as a significant plus and a distinct advantage. Every time an opponent or a member of the media points out yet another example of Trump beating the system, manipulating the system or in some way getting over on the system, his credibility is enhanced. It's hard to even begin to imagine, but in some way he's become the Robin Hood of this election. He is the representative of all those who want to beat the system that's been beating us - beating us down.Quite remarkable that at any moment, he not only empathizes with those people being screwed, he declares himself to be one of them, he's getting screwed. Yet in another moment, he boasts of how he screws the system himself.It was so remarkable to me that as he was wrapping up the nomination, and it was clear he had won the primaries, that he declared himself the victim of the Republican National Committee and his opponents in the Congress. Winner and victim, screwer and screwed -- all in the same sentence.INSPIRATIONAL and ASPIRATIONAL: Trump is both inspirational and aspirational. He declares what everyone knows to be the truth; America is on the decline in many areas. And most importantly, the majority of us see the physical evidence of this decline every day from the rusting and deteriorating bridges to the crumbling and potholed roads to trains breaking down and airports decaying: infrastructure of all sizes and shapes falling apart..And from this truth, however exaggerated Trump presents it, he promises that he will rebuild America -- and us, our belief in our institutions and the American dream! People know that much of what he says is a falsehood. But they seem to believe -- or simply want to believe -- that he is a builder. So when he talks about the obvious and irrefutable fact that the infrastructure is crumbling and that he can alone rebuild it, it has resonance for millions of voters.Trump speaks of America, not about the government. He talks about America the country, not rules and regulations and policy. He inspires people to believe that America can be great once again. That alone he can do it - there's no call to service other than ""vote for me and I'll take care of everything.""Of course, none of this makes sense, especially since those with any experience in government know that the institutional constraints will prevent Trump from doing almost anything. But Trump's been very clever to stay out of the conversation about government and speak frequently of his track record of beating the system and building ""stuff."" No matter how loathsome that may be to the basic tenants of ethics and morality, he's convinced people that he can transcend government, our laws, and even the basic rules of life.In my lifetime, I've never heard a candidate capable of carrying four distinct and often contradictory messages all at the same time. And too, I'm convinced and afraid that his support is broader and deeper than the polls and pundits believe. From my own experience in over 40 years in politics, I know that it is unlikely that many voters are willing to disclose to a pollster whether in person, on the phone or even online that they support Trump primarily because of the implied or explicit, depending on your viewpoint, endorsement of his racism, bigotry and class warfare.And those who criticize Trump for his lack of knowledge about foreign and military affairs and his ignorance about how the political and legislative process work don't understand that it's dawned on a significant part of the electorate that all those politicians and government officials that claim to know so much about these matters have screwed it all up -- big time, leaving ordinary folks way behind. No one has to like Trump at all to see and understand this feeling.So when Trump doles out his messages, especially with four doorways for voters to enter, he is a force to be reckoned with. Trump is truly a four-legged stool; mirroring the fear and anger, empathizing with the feeling of being screwed while doing some significant screwing of the system and of people himself, and inspiring a sense that only he can rebuild America and the American Dream.Quite a remarkable messaging strategy indeed. Whether it remains four-legged or loses one or more of its legs and collapses as his opponents from all sides of the establishment chip away, will be the drama of the next several months.For those who dismiss Trump, beware.

This requires citizen respect for the law.12 years ago, then Illinois Senator Barack Obama said in a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston that there is not a white America, nor Black America, only ""A United States of America.""Today, as then, his ""United States of America"" consists of an approximate 12-13% African-American population -- constituting 35% of jail inmates and 37% of prison inmates -- of the 2.2 million male inmates as of 2014 (U.S. Department of Justice, 2014).The proportion of blacks in prison populations exceeds the proportion among state residents in twenty states. African-Americans constitute nearly one million of the total 2.2 million incarcerated population. We experience nearly six times the incarceration rate of whites.  This is the current reality of President's Obama's ""United States America,"" described 12 years ago.No fundamental change will occur in the relationship between African-Americans and the police in our country today until we are comfortable talking about the history of slavery and white supremacy.There is little likelihood that we as nation in 2016 will have the capacity to appropriately address the consequences of that legacy upon today's generational descendants of slaves and slave owners and upon the current relationship between police and African-Americans unless we are willing to confront our history.In science and medicine, efforts are made to objectively study and examine the origins and genesis of a disease. Why do we so easily dismiss and/or appear unwilling to clinically examine the current consequences of the earlier institution of slavery and the companion history of police-enforced white supremacy?Our recognition of this issue was the raison d'etre for the creation and teaching of a 15-week college course, ""FROM SLAVERY TO OBAMA: Renewing The Promise of Reconstruction."" I currently teach it at the University of San Francisco. The syllabus description of the course says:In his epic treatise, The Souls of Black Folk, published in 1903, renowned sociologist and historian, Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois, commenting on the legacy of Slavery in our country said, ""the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color-line."" More than a hundred years after he wrote those words, the racial struggles in the United States remain the most pervasive theme in our history. Slavery, the Civil War, and nearly a century of racial segregation stand as stains on the moral fabric of the United States. Notwithstanding, the election and re-election of America's first African-American President of the United States, frank discussions on race relations in America and the historical impact of the institution of slavery upon our current society remain problematical. The events in Ferguson, Cleveland, Baltimore, Staten Island, NY, and Charleston, SC in 2015(now in Baton Rouge and Minneapolis) indicate ""a fierce urgency of now"" for our nation, once and for all, to confront the reality of the consequential impact of the legacy of slavery upon the current attitudes and conduct of the descendants of slaves and slaveholders. Through an in-depth examination of the long history of white supremacy and the black struggle against it, this course is designed to enable honest and critical discussion about race in America. Readings, lectures, and activities will focus on those events and individuals that have decisively shaped and influenced America's efforts to abolish slavery and address its historical consequences and subsequent efforts to create a society based on values of racial equality and social justice.  Commencing this semester, a weekly video production of the course is being offered online to those colleges and universities interested in participating in its online access.On the basis of objective empirical evidence, it is an understatement to say that, generally, African-Americans distrust the police in their communities. For police lives to matter, African-Americans will have to come to believe that THEIR lives also matter to the police in their communities.As the Democratic and Republican parties assemble in national conventions to nominate their respective candidates for President of the United States our immediate national challenge is to develop a national consensus which ultimately says: ""Black Lives Matter/Police Lives Matter!""Regrettably, recent statements by President Obama and the apparent Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, to put it charitably, seem to indicate that they are ""out to lunch"" about the experiences of African-Americans with police. Their statements indicate a regrettable 30,000 feet disconnect from the daily on the ground reality of the Black Experience with police across our nation.For the Black community to respect and trust police in their communities they have to overcome the unavoidable historical presumption that police disrespect them and will preemptively elect to shoot them first in seeking an arrest. In short, police lives will matter when police actively show and indicate that Black Lives are as important as white lives. Police, political leaders, media, our nation at large should heed the simple plea inscribed on one of the placards of demonstrators peacefully protesting in Dallas:""STOP KILLING US!"" If not now when?If not us, who?"

While South Korean government believes it could ask China for understanding and persuade its unavoidable circumstances based on the good bilateral relations, the reality is actually going the opposite. Besides, it has been revealed that the highest level officials of the Chinese government are even considering military action. It seems the bilateral relationship may end up collapsing. Such assertion is not an exaggeration considering China's rising discomfort over the THAAD deployment. Most of all, the Chinese view of South Korea is worsening rapidly. Some of vigorous nationalists insisted on powerful revenge, stating, ""Korean are betrayers! They stabbed us in the back."" Of course, the anti-Korea sentiment is spreading rapidly online. [Missiles of the Second Artillery Corps, the missile forces of China. In the worst case, they may be used to contain THAAD./ Source: Xinhua News Agency] Chinese authorities are unlikely to keeping a level head. When Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi recently made his official visit to Colombo in Sri Lanka, he made incredibly strong statements to the reporters. According to the July 10th report of leading Beijing newspaper Beijing Times, the minister clearly stated the state's stance, stating, ""We hope friends of South Korea will think calmly that whether the THAAD system is conducive to their national security, to the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and to the solution of the nuclear issue of the peninsula."" His statement sounds like if the THAAD deployment is not cancelled, China won't cooperate to the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and to the solution of the nuclear issue of the peninsula. What's important is that the minister called Korea as 'friends'. The overall nuance is not positive at all.Media is also taking a firm stand. One of the good examples is Global Times, a Chinese newspaper under the People's Daily which is famous for its firm tone. It claimed, ""China must take revenge. There are thousands of methods."" One of their way to revenge is expelling Korea Embassy officials, press correspondents, and sojourning employees of Korean conglomerates. It may also impose economic retaliation. This is why there is criticism over the Korean government among Korean company officials and Korean residents in China."

Protesters eventually did so, marching down Airline Highway and shutting down traffic in one direction as cops followed.Most of the earlier exchanges had been verbal, though some protesters threw bottles at the officers. Police arrested at least three protesters who initially moved off the sidewalk, and also threatened to arrest a group of teenage girls who were picking up the bottles and other trash from the street. Tensions were high after a sniper killed five law enforcement officers at a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas on Thursday, allegedly citing revenge for recent police shootings as a motive. That massacre came midway through a week already marked with tragedy: The day after police killed Sterling, a 37-year-old father of five, an officer shot and killed Philando Castile, 32, during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. The shootings of both black men were caught on graphic and widely shared videos, and sparked renewed calls for reforming police use of force and the criminal justice system. “We need answers. Someone needs to be charged with (Sterling’s) murder,” Baton Rouge resident Nadarrian Shearrill told The Advocate. One police officer in riot gear, who would not provide his name, pinned the fault of the confrontation on the media for supposedly “poking the bull.”Demonstrations against Sterling’s death, which protesters had previously held in front of the convenience store where he was killed, had not been met with a heavy police presence until Friday night, according to The Advocate.

The Trump campaign had no comment.The thinking is that Flynn, who has been a foreign policy adviser to Trump, would be able to help Trump in the area of national security at a time of challenges abroad like the threat from Islamic State militants.Trump is also considering a more conventional political choice for his running mate, such as former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, Indiana Governor Mike Pence or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.Flynn was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012-2014.He has spoken in the past about wanting the United States to work more closely with Russia to resolve global security issues.Flynn told Russia Today in an interview published on Dec. 10 that the United States and Russia should work together to resolve the Syrian civil war and defeat Islamic State.Flynn has a book coming out next week, co-written with Michael Ledeen, titled: “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies.”(Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

34,POLITICS,The HuffPost Story That Bizarrely Rocked Boston,Daniel Marans and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/huffpost-story-bizarrely-rocked-boston_us_5780be16e4b0c590f7e98d84,An indictment of the Boston media’s failure to expose a federal prosecutor results in more of the same.,2016-07-09,The Boston Herald focused on whether Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D) was responsible for planting The Huffington Post's story on U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5780c20a1b00002600f6cef9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Huffington Post raised the issue Wednesday of the Boston media’s failure to report on the questionable record of Carmen Ortiz, the top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts.As if working to prove the point, Boston media promptly turned its guns on the mayor and HuffPost in response.The Boston Herald, a conservative tabloid rival of The Boston Globe, made the story the subject of the front page of its print edition on Thursday. “HUFF AND PUFF: Marty and his union pals delight in Huffington Post article slamming Carmen Ortiz,” the broadsheet blared, on the backdrop of a blown-up photo of Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D) alongside a smaller photo of Ortiz. NPR offered a thoughtful segment on the issue, which you can listen to here.NPR aside, the question for the Boston media was not whether the local federal prosecutor was regularly overreaching, but whether the idea to write the story originated with HuffPost or the office of the mayor, and the mayor’s chief of staff in particular. Dan Koh previously worked as chief of staff to HuffPost editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington. While the Herald, in good tabloid fashion, was front and center with its questioning, Boston Globe reporters mostly stuck to Twitter.Having written the story, we can say with certainty it was our idea, but the question is a strange one, because the story relies entirely on publicly available information and interviews with subjects who are named and speaking on the record. The reaction is symptomatic of the problem HuffPost laid out. Matt Connolly, a criminal defense attorney in Boston, said HuffPost “did a great service making [Ortiz’s record] public.”Connolly said it took a media outlet not based in Boston to challenge Ortiz and to point out the close relationship she has with the town’s flagship paper, the Globe.“The Globe/Ortiz connection does a disservice to all the people,” he said. “Never has the newspaper issued a critical word about her office. The rest of our local media is also silent. Our local PBS station has the Globe on at the end of its show telling what will be in tomorrow’s paper.”Local observers long tired of the milquetoast treatment they believe the federal prosecutor has received in the press rejoiced after the story’s publication late Tuesday night and Wednesday.That celebration became the focus of much of the coverage of our article.The “story was important because it highlighted the enormous power possessed by U.S. Attorneys, as well as the tendency of this particular U.S. Attorney to wield that power in puzzling ways,” said Matthew Segal, legal director of the Massachusetts American Civil Liberties Union. Ortiz recently indicted two Walsh administration officials on charges of “union-related extortion” for encouraging the company running a music festival to use union stagehands. As the HuffPost article explains, it is unclear that their alleged behavior was even illegal. One way or another, it is the kind of typical union advocacy that does not merit a federal case.But as the Herald indicated, many believe Walsh himself, a former union leader, is the real target of Ortiz’s crusade.The Herald, which is skeptical of unions, asked whether HuffPost’s story showed that Walsh is “waging a PR counter-offensive against the feds after they indicted two top City Hall aides on extortion charges.”America Rising, a conservative political action committee founded by veterans of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s (R) presidential campaign, announced it filed a public records request to determine conclusively whether Walsh or any of his staff coordinated with HuffPost. The inquiry turned up only two emails, according to the Herald ― one each from the Boston Globe and Boston Herald, both asking the mayor’s office if it conspired with HuffPost. The Herald, after running its cover story Thursday, followed up with a new article Friday, this time reporting the lack of results from the FOIA attempt. On Friday afternoon, with the records request yielding nothing, a Herald reporter called HuffPost and asked how it was we communicated with the mayor’s office ― phone? Text? Email? ― to let them know the story was coming. That was the only question he had. That’s seriously where the story is heading. Then the Herald ran another story on Saturday, with the headline, “Marty Walsh mum on Huffington Post’s Carmen Ortiz article.”The Boston press has lost its mind. “Your story has shaken things up here in Boston, just as Ortiz is beginning her jihad against organized labor sympathizers in the administration of Mayor Walsh (with the intent, some say, of climbing the ladder to the mayor herself) and her odd investigation into alleged racism at Boston Latin School,” said Harvey Silverglate, a criminal defense attorney and Ortiz critic HuffPost quoted in the Ortiz story. “Whether this results in more objective news coverage, or an intensified level of sycophancy, nobody can predict.” It’s been interesting to watch the Herald ride to the defense of Ortiz, when the HuffPost article’s criticism of the media focused on its rival, the Globe. Joan Venocchi, an opinion columnist for the Globe, had a more balanced take. She characterized HuffPost’s story and the high-profile critics quoted in it as the kind of “push back” elicited by noble efforts to root out political corruption.But she acknowledged that the article raised legitimate questions that Ortiz should be able to answer if she is to succeed in her role as a federal prosecutor.Mayor Walsh perhaps said it best, in a Saturday follow-up article in the Herald:“I don’t understand the obsession about this article,” he said."
35,POLITICS,Clinton Reaffirms Support For Public Option In Bid For Sanders Supporters,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-public-option_us_5781064fe4b01edea78e1cf1,"Sanders gushes, saying the health care proposals ""will save lives.""",2016-07-09,"U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s call to increase funding for federally run health clinics is a bit more specific, in that she’s put a dollar figure on it. It would be $40 billion over 10 years.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578121781a00002600dd0691.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton reaffirmed her support on Saturday for creating a “public option” within Obamacare and allowing people to enroll in Medicare at age 55.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also called for a substantial increase in funding in medical clinics that serve low-income Americans, fully embracing a proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).While Clinton has long supported the creation of new government-run insurance options and reiterated that support several times this year, Saturday’s statement comes three days before she is scheduled to make her first joint campaign appearance with Sanders ― who has championed government-run insurance and federally financed clinics throughout his career and during his own bid for the presidency.Sanders, who ran a surprisingly strong but ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination, is expected to endorse Clinton at that Tuesday event. Saturday’s announcement on health policy follows a similar one from Clinton earlier in the week, that she was enhancing her own proposal on college tuition assistance to match the considerably more generous version Sanders had sketched out.In describing the proposals to The Huffington Post, senior Clinton campaign aides noted that Sanders had championed these ideas ― and, in particular, that the former Secretary of State’s funding proposal for the clinics matched one that the independent senator had made. “We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America,” Clinton said in a press release that the campaign circulated late Saturday morning. “Already, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. As president, I will make sure Republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy.”Sanders said in a conference call shortly afterwards that the announcement was the product of discussion between the two campaigns. He praised Clinton’s proposal in strong, unambiguous terms ― describing it as “an extremely important initiative” and predicting that “it will save lives, it will ease suffering, it will improve health care in America, and it will cut health care costs.”The idea of the public option ― as first sketched out by Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist ― is to create a separate, government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers offering coverage through the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges. The hope is that this competition can help keep premiums for all the insurance plans low, particularly if the government-run plan has the ability to dictate low reimbursement rates to doctors, hospitals, drugmakers, and other suppliers of medical care. President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders included versions of the public option in their proposals when they first began working on health care reform in 2009. But they ended up jettisoning the idea in response to protests from more conservative Democrats, who were less enthusiastic about government programs and industry groups, like hospitals and insurance companies, that feared what a public option would do to their income streams.The idea of a Medicare buy-in has been around for even longer, although it, too, appeared in 2009 when Democrats were drawing up health care legislation. The goal, again, would be to give consumers ― in this case, those older than 55 and at greater risk of becoming sick ― one more insurance option if they can’t get coverage through an employer or an existing government program.Clinton has expressed support for both ideas during the 2016 campaign, noting that she had called for them previously. (She made a public option part of her campaign proposal to reform health care in 2008.) But campaign aides said Saturday’s announcement is a reminder of how seriously she takes the idea ― and her determination to promote it as president.That might reassure some of the progressive Sanders supporters skeptical of Clinton’s commitment to their values and goals ― and, in some cases, angry at her attacks on Sanders’ proposal to create a single, government-run insurance plan that would provide coverage to all Americans, supplanting private insurance altogether.Of course, Clinton’s announcement comes with no policy details. She isn’t answering any of the many complicated questions that either proposal would raise ― like exactly how either the Obamacare public option or Medicare buy-in plan would pay the providers of medical services, or exactly who could enroll in either one.Clinton’s call to increase funding for federally run health clinics is a bit more specific, in that she’s put a dollar figure on it. It would be $40 billion over 10 years. She hasn’t identified new revenue or spending cuts to cover the cost of the proposal, but she has said that she will remain true to her pledge to pay for the price of any proposals ― a pledge that she has largely kept in this campaign, independent budget analysts say.And while the clinic proposal likely to get a lot less attention than anything Clinton says about the public option of Medicare, the idea, if implemented, could help a great many people get medical care.The clinics are the backbone of the nation’s health care safety net, providing primary care to millions of Americans who either have no health insurance or whose insurance doesn’t meet their needs ― a group that, even after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, is large and underserved.About one in 14 Americans currently gets health care through a federally funded clinic, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That’s thanks to annual funding of about $5 billion, a big chunk of which comes from a provision in the Affordable Care Act that Sanders championed.“This would be a substantial infusion of funding,” Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost. “More funding for community health centers creates an infrastructure to care for increasing numbers of insured people and also provides resources to reach the remaining uninsured to encourage them to get covered.”Federal clinics happen to be one of the few government-run healthcare programs with a history of strong bipartisan support. George W. Bush was a big fan during his presidency, for example. So while both a public option and Medicare buy-in would likely run into the same political opposition that stopped them in 2009,more money for clinics would have a chance of becoming law even with Republicans controlling a house of Congress.This article has been updated to include more specific details on Clinton’s proposal and reactions to it.CLARIFICATION: Language has been updated to indicate that Clinton expressed support for the public option on her campaign site before the Saturday announcement."

He was stranded in front of the official police perimeter and unable to move because officers believed the shooter was located inside a nearby garage. Moore couldn’t contact his partner, friends or family because he’d left his cell phone at his apartment to charge. “That was the worst, I couldn’t let anyone know,” he told HuffPost.Moore said the experience was “surreal,” but it suddenly became “very real” when he saw the officer down. “You’re breathing heavy, your mind is racing,” he said. “You’re looking all around your environment, making sure you know where you are, what’s happening.”When it came to eventually leaving the area during a break in the gunfire, Moore said the officer he photographed stood up to create a human shield. He got behind and they walked “as hastily as possible” back to the main police line.Since posting the photographs to Facebook and Instagram on Friday, Moore said multiple people have come forward to him with the police officer’s identity. He declined to name him, but said he did want to thank him in person.Five police officers were killed and additional officers and civilians were wounded in the shooting. Dallas police have identified Micah Xavier Johnson, a 25-year-old Army veteran, as the sole suspect behind the attack."

But since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, the region, just eight miles (13 km) outside the capital, has become the scene of some of the worst destruction and violence, forcing most of its residents to flee.In the conflict’s early months, peaceful protests in Ghouta’s administrative center, Douma, were met with government force. In September 2011, one of the first armed opposition groups established itself in the area, and by early 2013, most of Eastern Ghouta was controlled by armed Syrian opposition groups, the largest of them being the Army of Islam, or Jaish al-Islam.Today, conditions are grim in Ghouta, where the government’s indiscriminate airstrikes and shelling have resulted largely in civilian deaths. The Violation Documentation Center estimates that at least 6,160 people were killed in Douma alone, and a report by Amnesty International last August found that government air attacks on the area are “indiscriminate and disproportionate.”Matters are made worse by a regime- and rebel-maintained siege that has left Ghouta’s remaining population struggling for food, medicine and services. The government began to restrict civilian movement and cutting off water and electricity in late 2012. Non-state armed groups also restrict civilians’ mobility, and have heavily inflated food prices. Most of Ghouta’s infrastructure has been destroyed by airstrikes, including at least 10 medical facilities.But amid the rubble and wreckage in Douma, a place where most people are only willing to buy the basic necessities, a small, family-run, antique shop still stands.Despite the warring factions, airstrikes and siege, 26-year-old Abu Abdo opens his family’s antique shop every day. The shop displays vintage swords, daggers and china sets, some more than 1,000 years old. The shop owner spoke with Syria Deeply about his decision to remain in his wartorn hometown and keep his family’s business running, despite no longer being able to sell anything. Abandoning his family’s trade, he told Syria Deeply, would be a form of death itself.Syria Deeply: What made you stay in Douma, despite the war and siege?Abu Abdo: I have a wife and two children, and we live in a small house in the center of Douma. All my friends and relatives have left. They all advised me to leave Ghouta, and either move to Damascus, or try to seek asylum in Europe. I refused to leave Eastern Ghouta in order to preserve my shop. I have not left because this place is who I am. It is my soul.This shop is more than 70 years old, and I inherited the shop from my father 15 years ago. I have been working in this place since I was seven, and my father worked here, too.Syria Deeply: Douma has been hit by several heavy attacks, many of them targeting civilian areas, in recent years. Has your shop ever come under fire? How do you protect your antiques?Abu Abdo: We have been robbed and bombed, but I couldn’t leave my shop, I’ve practiced my trade here for more than 17 years.A shell hit our building and damaged the second floor of the shop, so we moved all of our valuable pieces into storage for safekeeping. Every day, I still place a 100-year-old hookah bowl with four antique swords atop it, across the street on the sidewalk. But I am more careful when the Syrian regime bombs the city.Syria Deeply: How is business at the shop these days? Are people in Eastern Ghouta willing or able to buy antiques?Abu Abdo: People are suffering, and their priority right now is to provide food for their families. Due to the tight blockade imposed on Eastern Ghouta, people have changed a lot, and nobody is able to buy or possess such expensive items anymore. People pass by and enjoy looking at the pieces we showcase, but we almost never sell anything. I even had to sell some land I own to cover my family’s daily expenses, as well as my shop’s expenses.Before the revolution, I would sell 10 pairs of china bowls a year, and each pair used to sell for around $500. Now, we almost never sell, and when we do, the pair goes for no more than 2,000 Syrian pounds, which is between $4 and $5.Syria Deeply: Can you tell us about your most prized items?Abu Abdo: This sword is French. It has a French stamp and a picture of Napoleon Bonaparte. Before the revolution, its price was around 100,000 Syrian pounds, which was equal to $2,000. Now it can sell for no more than $100.This Islamic sword is 300 years old. Historically, it was used by mounted infantry, and people used to call it “The Jewel.” It is worth around 100,000 Syrian pounds. This other sword is also French, made in 1920. We call it Kala or Bala. Before the revolution, its market price was about $500, but now I am selling it for $100. This dagger is called “Karda,” and was used by fighters in Africa. It was made in Persia in 1199, and so it is more than 800 years old. Its price before the revolution was between $3,000 and $4,000, but now it sells for a 100,000 Syrian pounds, which is around $200.These drawers and dressers are 300 years old, and these are old china plates and kettles. This wooden box inlaid with shells is more than 200 years old. Historically, only rich people were able to own such expensive pieces.Syria Deeply: What do you think the future holds for antique trading in Ghouta?Abu Abdo: I have not lost hope. I love my work. A little museum will open soon in Douma, and I will be one of those in charge of it. We will try to collect all of the locally available, valuable antique pieces, and keep them in the museum. It will be the first of its kind in Eastern Ghouta.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply. For weekly updates about the war in Syria, you can sign up to the Syria Deeply email list. "

San Fermin is the most famous internationally and attracts thousands of revelers, many from as far afield as the United States and Australia.The 33-year-old Japanese man was gored in the chest and a 24-year-old Spanish man in the arm, while 12 others suffered minor injuries, the local government said on its website.The Spaniard’s injury was classed as “less serious.” The local hospital declined to comment on the Japanese man’s condition, although the local Red Cross office said he had been taken there in an ambulance.The four-minute run featured six bulls from the Jose Escolar ranch, one of which separated from the rest and caused panic among the runners.The daily bull run starts at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) and usually lasts between three and five minutes. There are eight runs in total during the festival.Over the past century 15 people have died in the event, which dates back hundreds of years, according to a count on the unofficial San Fermin website. The last death was recorded in 2009.(Reporting by Eloy Alonso; Writing by Angus Berwick; Editing by Gareth Jones)"
