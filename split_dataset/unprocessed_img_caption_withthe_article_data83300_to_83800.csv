Every combination of flesh, nerves, bones and blood has its particularities and limitations, some of which restrict the experience of its owner more severely than others.For issues that threaten our safety and survival, technology offers a helping hand. Glasses improve vision. Crutches, wheelchairs and prosthetics help with movement. For those with abnormal heart rhythms, there are pacemakers. But what about the less dire limitations, for example, those that affect your aesthetic perception? How would your life be different if you couldn't see color, if the range of your vision was limited to various degrees of black and white?Getting dressed, chopping vegetables, flipping through TV channels and magazine pages -- many banal yet stimulating sensual experiences would be drained of their vigor, swapped out for ashen simulacrums. Routine activities like obeying traffic signals and road signs would become strenuous, potentially dangerous. Colorblindness is often regarded more as a quirky personality trait than a serious affliction, though for some, the ascetic diet for the eyes saps daily life of its juice.Facing such a condition, would you turn to technology's helping hand? Would you ever, say, consider becoming a cyborg? It sounds radical at first, although, in actuality, most of us are already micro-modifying our bodies fairly frequently, every day, from the moment we wake up. A cup of coffee, perhaps an Advil, moisturizer, makeup, vitamins, contacts -- all before leaving the house.Could you be tempted by the opportunity to enhance your body by inextricably binding your flesh with technology? Perhaps the better question is, have you done so already?Harder, better, faster, strongerOren Etzioni, Executive Director of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, defined a cyborg as ""part person, part machine,"" in an email to The Huffington Post. In her feminist text ""The Cyborg Manifesto,"" Donna Haraway takes a more theoretical approach. ""A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction.""Then there's artist Neil Harbisson. He explained to The Huffington Post that, from his perspective, the term cyborg explores ""how technology could be used as a sense and not as a tool."" He should know. Harbisson, after having an antenna implanted into his skull, is the world's first legally-recognized cyborg.Harbisson's body modification is a curved antenna that shoots up from the back of his head and rests dangling between his eyes like a comic book superhero equipped with insect feelers. With a sharp-edged bowl cut and a penchant for neon-colored suits, Harbisson's image lands somewhere between a 1960s boy band frontman and an alien avatar, almost but not quite blending in.By profession he is an artist, but it's clear from a single glimpse that Harbisson is also a work of art. Not to mention, a radical scientific achievement.""Becoming a cyborg is, in a way, modifying your body as if it was your sculpture,"" Harbisson said. ""I believe that cyborgism is the art of creating your own senses, your own body parts, and then expressing yourself. When that happens, you become the artwork."" So many shades of gray Harbisson's journey toward becoming a cyborg began, essentially, at birth. He was born colorblind; specifically, Harbisson experienced a rare form called achromatopsia, which allowed him to see the world only in shades of gray. As far as colorblindness goes, he possessed a severe and rare form, affecting one in every 33,000 people.These days, however, Harbisson holds an even more singular condition, sonochromatopsia. The odds of experiencing it are about one in seven billion. Derived from ""sono"" (Latin for sound), ""chromat"" (Greek for color) and ""opsia"" (Greek for visual condition), the term, created especially for Harbisson, implies the possession of an extra sense -- the ability to hear color.Harbisson's sonochromatopsia is distinct from synaesthesia, a neurological phenomenon in which an experience in one sensory pathway sparks an automatic and unconscious experience in a second sensory pathway. So a person with synaesthesia could, for example, see music or taste color.While some synaesthetes can indeed hear color, Harbisson is not hearing with his ears; rather, he is experiencing color through an audible vibration transmitted via antenna to his skull. ""I don't need to open my eyes. I can hear colors with my eyes shut,"" Harbisson said. ""The way I hear color is not the way I hear sound. It's a different sense.""Harbisson acquired this inhuman ability thanks to what he calls an eyeborg, the coiling affixed to his skull. With the help of said eyeborg, Harbisson's brain automatically distinguishes light's hue and converts it to an audible frequency, like a music note that skips the ears and goes straight to the brain. ""For me the sense of color is an independent sense, it doesn't relate to sight or to hearing.""Born in Belfast, Ireland, and raised in Catalonia, Spain, Harbisson, now 32, felt from a young age that he was different. Many a stoned college student has tripped out pondering the possibility that ""my green may not be the same as your green, and neither of us would ever know it."" For Harbisson, this wasn't far from the truth. ""I noticed that other children in class could identify color easily and I couldn't. I knew there was an issue with color, but it wasn't until I was 11 that I realized I wasn't confusing colors, I couldn't see them at all.""How much would digesting the world in grayscale affect your daily life? It's impossible to say, just as it's impossible for a person who is colorblind to visualize a tangerine-tinted sunset. Travis Korte, a data scientist who experiences deuteranomaly colorblindess, a less intense variation that affects about six percent of the population, expressed a similar sentiment. ""If I woke up one morning not colorblind, would my mind be blown? Or would I be disappointed that I wasn't missing out so much in the first place and had no idea.""He added: ""It is a little bit alluring, the idea of doing some modification to know what I've been missing.""In part because of his colorblindness, Harbisson wasn't all too interested in visual arts as a kid. He did, however, play piano and eventually studied experimental music composition at Dartington College of Arts in Devon, England. It was there that Harbisson attended a lecture by cybernetics expert Adam Montandon, who introduced him to the transdisciplinary approach of exploring regulatory systems. ""That's where I discovered the potentials of cybernetics,"" Harbisson said.Merriam Webster defines cybernetics as ""the science of communication and control theory that is concerned especially with the comparative study of automatic control systems."" If the definition sounds unnecessarily cumbersome, it's because the term itself is so tricky to pin down.At what point does your body become so inextricably linked with its technological auxiliaries that your very categorization as a human being no longer holds? ""Is a person wearing Google glass a cyborg?"" Etzioni added in his email. ""How about an Apple Watch? How about a brain implant?""Visions of futuristic beings donning metal helmets, sprouting cables and cords spring to mind. But then again, look around your local coffee shop and peruse its inhabitants, with ears exuding plastic-coated wires that link up skeleton and screen. Maybe our imaginary, sci-fi inflected cyborg stereotypes need a 2015 reality check. For Donna Haraway, cyborgs aren't only a thing of the future. ""By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs.""Taste the rainbowAs a student, Harbisson ended up collaborating with Montandon on the first incarnation of the eyeborg, serving as Harbisson's final college project. At this point, the apparatus was an antenna with a webcam at the end, attached to a computer and a pair of headphones. The webcam translated each color into a sound wave that traveled to Harbisson via the headphones. He refined the operation over time, reducing the size of the computer and strapping it under his clothes.Now, the computer has been shrunk to the size of a chip and the antenna is embedded directly into Harbisson's skull. It wasn't easy to find a doctor to perform the operation, the first of its kind. The doctor who eventually agreed to perform the surgery asked to remain confidential.After months, the implanted antenna finally merged with Harbisson's occipital bone, and the mechanism was fully osseointegrated inside his skull. Suddenly, Harbisson could hear the many light frequencies of the color spectrum, including colors invisible to the eye such as infrareds and ultra violets.""When it was implanted in my head, it became like a body part, and was much more comfortable,"" Harbisson said. Even so, the adjustment took time. ""Hearing color was very overwhelming, because color is everywhere. I had to get used to the fact that everything I looked at had a sound.""It took approximately five weeks to acclimate to the new incessant sense and the headaches that accompanied it. At first, Harbisson consciously worked to memorize the names of the colors he was hearing, eventually matching up a different frequency with each of the 360 shades of the color wheel. After about five months, the system became a perception and the perception became a feeling. ""Eventually it just became natural,"" he said.And then everything was different, in a way that, for all of us except Harbisson, is difficult to imagine. A world in black-and-white buzzing with frequencies, humming an ambient portrait straight into the brain. Certain places purred at especially appealing rhythms. ""It's very attractive to walk along the supermarket,"" Harbisson explained in his TED Talk. ""It's like going to a nightclub, full of different melodies. Especially the aisle with cleaning products!""Even when his eyes are closed, Harbisson keeps seeing colors, as the hues swirling in his imagination conjure their respective audible equivalents. ""When I dream, I hear and perceive colors, but it's created by my imagination, not by software,"" he explained. ""That's when I felt like the cybernetic device had become an extension of my senses.""Although Harbisson is the only person to currently experience sonochromatopsia, any future cyborgs would experience the exact same correlation between color and sound, which works both ways. His enhanced perception allowed Harbisson to divine unlikely connections between the two -- telephone rings are green, Mozart concertos yellow, Amy Winehouse pink. Rothko paintings produce clear notes -- reminiscent of the meditative sounds of a crystal bowl sound bath, while Leonardo Da Vinci's use of chiaroscuro yields what Harbisson likens to a horror film soundtrack.While the rest of us color coordinate, Harbisson harmonizes.Transformed by the power of artOn a good day, artists can tap into something vital humming ever so gently in the distance, before it becomes audible to the rest of us. The body and the self, in the past 25 years, have become handy media for the radical multidisciplinary artist, with identities now as malleable as clay -- and, artistically speaking, far less warmed-over. Although she does not consider herself a cyborg, French artist Orlan was the first to experiment with artistically-inclined physical surgery. For her 1990 piece ""The Reincarnation of Saint-Orlan,"" she surgically modified her body nine times to imitate specific ideals of beauty established throughout Western history by male artists. Her goal was to acquire, for example, Mona Lisa's forehead and Venus' chin, as painted by Botticelli.""I have been the first artist to use aesthetic surgery in another context -- not to appear younger or better according to the designated pattern,"" Orlan explained in an earlier interview with The Huffington Post. ""I wanted to disrupt the standards of beauty.""Much of Orlan's work explores the masculine pressures that often invade feminine flesh. Yet instead of condemning such compulsions, Orlan invites them in, incorporates them into herself, thereby blurring the initial categories until they no longer hold. ""I don't know who are the men and who are the women,"" she said. ""In French I used to say 'je suis un femme et une homme.' That is to say a feminine male and a masculine female. A she man and a he woman. What I am interested in is developing a singularity, which would be my own.""Actress and Olympic athlete Aimee Mullins believes such limitless self-fashioning shouldn't be reserved for creatives alone. ""I love the power of the individual to create their body and their identity in a way that makes them happy,"" she explained to the Huffington Post. ""There is more room being made for that than ever before.""Mullins was born without fibula bones and, as a child, was told by doctors she would likely never walk. Her best shot, doctors told her, was to amputate her legs at the shins, hoping she'd learn to move via prosthetics while her peers learned to walk on their legs. She did, and quickly outpaced them all.Wearing prosthetics, Mullins competed in the Paralympics in 1996 in Atlanta, Georgia, and, before retiring from track and field two years later, set world records in the 100-meter, the 200-meter and the long jump. Aside from her athletic accomplishments, Mullins also revels in the aesthetic and conceptual capabilities of her prosthetic limbs. While many collect shoes, she collects legs, with over 12 pairs to her name. Some resemble cheetah legs and translucent jellyfish tentacles, while one pair, designed by fashion icon Alexander McQueen, features wild, gnarled vines carved into elm wood. Mullins was a muse to the late McQueen, as well as to conceptual artist Matthew Barney, having appeared in his video works ""Cremaster Cycle"" and ""River of Fundament.""Mullins isn't physically bound to her technological ancillaries, though at times she considers them a crucial part of her bodily composition. ""Some prosthetics absolutely are a part of my body and I think that if you wear technology, especially in an intimate way, there is, in a way, an energy exchange between materials,"" she said.Unlike Harbisson, Mullins dons and removes her body modifications each day and, as such, does not identify as a cyborg -- or a living sculpture, for that matter. ""I don't consider my entire self an artwork,"" she said, ""but there is something of it being a performance piece when I go out in optically clear legs that look like glass and are 10 pounds each. To me, it's about inviting the conversation that comes with that. Inviting people to ask me questions, challenge what they thought the space between the body and the ground should look like.""For Harbisson, the separation between body and artifice does not exist. ""My life is part of my art, there is no separation,"" he said. ""I see becoming a cyborg as an artistic statement. I see cyborgism as an art movement, the art of creating your own senses, your own body parts, and then expressing yourself. When that happens, you become the artwork.""Beyond the aesthetic experiment that is his own life, Harbisson has also generated an entirely new form of fine art, a technique he refers to as creating ""sound portraits,"" brief moments of pure sound that capture the colorful essence of a human face, as experienced by Harbisson. The ambient chords range from harmonious to dissonant; Nicole Kidman could lull you to sleep while Prince Charles resembles an ominous Trent Reznor soundtrack.Charles was the first subject of Harbisson's unconventional portraiture. The two met when the Prince came to Harbisson's university in 2005 and asked about the device dangling above his head. ""I told him it was an antenna to hear colors,"" Harbisson said. ""I asked him if I could listen to him, to hear the colors of his face. I wrote down the notes and that was the first sound portrait. I didn't really plan it, it just came naturally.""Soon after, Harbisson embarked on the next logical move, transposing sound into color. ""When I listened to music I could paint what I heard. I started with very simple melodies and then got more complex. I start in the middle and keep adding layers of color, which are the notes of the piece, until the canvas ends."" The resulting images resemble hard-edged electric tapestries, vortexes of vivid colors layered at a dizzying pace. The vertiginous images are portals into Harbisson's mind, DayGlo-colored mazes that emphasize the singularity of Harbisson's sensual experience.As his electric lattice portraits reveal, Harbisson's mind can function as an artistic laboratory, as visual and aural input triggers the generation of novel material. And if the raw goods streaming in from Harbisson's antenna and imagination were not enough, his skull is Bluetooth-enabled allowing his mind to connect to the Internet and experience any hues out of reach.""I can receive colors from other parts of the world,"" he explains. ""If someone in Australia wants to send colors to my head they can use their mobile phone and they can send live images of a sunset for example, and I can perceive a sunset from wherever I am. Times like this are when I actually enjoy color the most. It's as if I have an eye somewhere else.""Harbisson's unusual encounters with color, without actually using his eyes, recall the work of artist James Turrell, who famously said light ""is not the bearer of revelation -- it is the revelation.""Turrell is known for his immersive, hallucinatory installations in which light becomes not an adjective but an amorphous, all consuming noun. His buzzy ""Perceptual Cell"" invited one viewer at a time into an enclosed white dome to experience 12 minutes as a vessel of perception. The viewer lies down and absorbs a pulsing stream of pure light and color, revealing that color does not only exist outside of us, in space, but also inside our eyelids, clamoring against our skulls. The uncanny resemblance between Turrell and Harbisson's work hints at this notion that they both know something we don't.Turrell's other works, large scale LED worlds that leave the viewer mystified and discombobulated, almost resemble three dimensional enactments of Harbisson's colorful translations of sound. ""I become a transparent eyeball,"" Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in his 1836 essay ""Nature."" Christopher Knight alludes to the quote in his review of Turrell's LACMA show. It seems, perhaps, an even better fit for Harbisson.Science and art have the power to transform, to turn metaphor and myth into something tangible, whether via medical procedure or immersive installation. In fact, Turrell insists his Perceptual Cell yields the exact same experience for colorblind participants and non-colorblind participants.Such confounding overlaps illuminate the close proximity of art and science, two creative fields that make the imagined real. Haraway's extended definition springs to mind: ""The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality."" Become who you areA cyborg is a hybrid between man and machine, reality and fiction. Yet in spirit, at least according to Haraway, the cyborg is a symbol of hybridity in general, of a life beyond binaries, of eternal becoming and perpetual in-between-ness.When discussing his surgery, Harbisson compared the stigma surrounding cybernetics to that surrounding transgender identity in the 1950s. ""Doctors said that [gender confirmation] operations were not necessary, could potentially be dangerous, and they were concerned about what others would think,"" Harbisson said.""Now [with cyborgs], it's the same. It's not necessary to extend our senses, it may be dangerous, and what would people think?""Of course, it's a major professional risk to embark on a surgical procedure without precedent. ""Doctors bear the incredible burden of caring for their patients, and so are appropriately conservative at times,"" Etzioni explained. ""When cybernetic technology has proved itself -- this will change, but slowly.""In fact, it's already changing. Harbisson, along with his friend Moon Ribas, founded the Cyborg Foundation in 2010, in part to defend what he's dubbed ""cyborg rights."" However, as Harbisson expressed clearly, ""The main right we are fighting for is the right to have surgery.""Some cyborg transitions are marked by surgery. But, at its core, becoming a cyborg is a matter of self-identification. To make a designation defined by hybridity a ""yes or no"" question misses the point entirely. Just as one can can identify not only as male or female, but infinite variations outside and in between, one can establish a multitude of relationships between body and its technological faculties.Comparisons between the transgender and the cyborg communities are certainly limited, but there are some parallels; some individuals in both groups would argue they embody futurist goals of openness, hybridity, potential. They would also say they understand the body we're born with is not the body we're tethered to and that just because something is biological does not mean it is authentic.""It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist culture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode,""Haraway explains in The Cyborg Manifesto, ""and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end.""In other words, specifically those of Friedrich Nietzsche, both movements allow human beings to become who they are.""We, however, want to become those we are -- human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves."" In an ever-evolving technological landscape, how will you construct yourself -- a nose job, a tattoo, an eyeborg? How will you enhance your body -- a workout routine, an eating habit, a prosthetic part? How do you want the world to perceive you and, more importantly, how do you want to perceive the world?""I think it's best to use cybernetics to extend our senses and perceptions of reality,"" Harbisson concluded. ""The more we can perceive, the better we can understand where we are and who we are. I think it's an essential part of our evolution.""An artist of the most unusual variety, Harbisson is devoted to helping mankind evolve. Classic cyborg behavior. Also on HuffPost:"
1,BUSINESS,Donald Trump's Arrogance Is Outdated In Corporate America,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-leadership-style_us_55a90614e4b0896514d1034b,Humility is the new hotness in the C-suite.,2015-07-20,Apple CEO Tim Cook's leadership style is in; Donald Trump's is out,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a907ed1200002b001354ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After spending decades as Wall Street darlings, arrogant business leaders are out of fashion. The new hotness for CEOs these days? Displaying humility, self-awareness and honesty.In this new world, a good leader doesn’t brag about his ""TEN BILLION DOLLARS,"" as Donald Trump's campaign did last week. A good leader doesn’t rank his workers and fire the bottom 10 percent each year, as revered General Electric CEO Jack Welch did back in the day. The new CEOs project humility. They apologize when they screw up. They admit when they don’t know something, and they empathize with their workers and treat them decently.Wild, right?“You have to be real and authentic. It requires having strong character,” the former CEO of Medtronic, Bill George, told The Huffington Post. “The Donald Trumps of the world, they make it in politics, not business.” Since declaring his intention to seek the Republican nomination for president last month, Trump has been out on the campaign trail, touting his leadership skills and experience. But for the most part, the business world has actually moved past his autocratic style. The shift has happened gradually over the past few years, in part because the financial crisis bred a deep mistrust for overly confident leaders and in part because social media has made it much easier to call out a boss for arrogance or wrongdoing.“The world has become more transparent, and the bar is being raised for who the leader is, not just what they know how to do,” said Fred Kiel, a former chief executive who now runs a consulting firm focused on leadership.Highly regarded CEOs are nearly six times as likely as poorly regarded CEOs to be considered humble, according to a survey of 1,700 executives across the globe (minus CEOs) released in March by Weber Shandwick, a public relations firm. Weber Shandwick also found more than 50 articles that mentioned “CEO humility” in 2014 -- about twice the average number for each year going back a decade or so.Humility in this case shouldn’t be confused with shyness, said Leslie Gaines-Ross, a public relations strategist at Weber Shandwick who advises executives on how to enhance their reputations. Rather, it’s about being more thoughtful and introspective. “It used to be that there were many more celebrity CEOs,” she said. “Now, most are more intent on building a good place to work than being stars.”Consider the first line of Satya Nadella’s email to employees on his first day as CEO of Microsoft: “Today is a very humbling day for me.”Nadella, a longtime Microsoft worker, has rapidly changed the culture at the company since becoming chief executive last year. He's fostered more teamwork and collaboration among employees who were once pitted against each other through a Hobbesian performance review structure. He’s forged partnerships with companies once considered bitter rivals. He’s also quick to acknowledge when he’s made a mistake -- as he did last year after telling women to have faith in the system to give them the “right raise.” Microsoft’s stock is up 8 percent since Nadella started. Apple CEO Tim Cook also embodies the new leadership style. Cook’s been outspoken in his support for gay rights, first coming out as gay in an October 2014 essay for Bloomberg Businessweek, then becoming a high-profile advocate for the LGBT community. He even chastised his home state of Alabama over its treatment of poor people and minorities. “Here’s a guy who seems to stand up for what he thinks is right,” said Kiel. “He’s also open to admitting mistakes.”Cook’s 2012 apology for a botched rollout of mapping software stood in sharp contrast to the non-apology offered by his predecessor, Steve Jobs, over an iPhone glitch in 2010.Under Cook, Apple’s financials have soared. CEOs who display character run companies that perform better financially, according to Kiel’s research -- an exhaustive seven-year study of 84 CEOs across multiple industries. Kiel defined character using four moral principles: integrity, responsibility, forgiveness and compassion. He also came up with a list of 25 behaviors and attributes that embody these principles, like “telling the truth,” “forgiveness” and “owning up to your mistakes.”He and his team asked CEOs to assess themselves on these traits, and asked their employees how they would rank their CEOs on the same metrics. They discovered that the CEOs who were graded as having the strongest character brought in five times more for the bottom line than the low-character CEOs.The CEOs at the bottom, said Kiel, tended to see the world as a dangerous place where people would take advantage of you. They didn’t always tell the truth. They placed their own financial security over the well-being of their company and their employees. Their workers didn’t trust them.The arrogant CEO started losing favor during the early 2000s with the downfall of self-interested scoundrels like Tyco’s Dennis Kozlowski, of $6,000-shower curtain fame, and Enron’s Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay, both convicted of fraud and conspiracy.The nail in the coffin was, of course, the financial crisis of 2008, when Americans lost patience for executive bravado and arrogance.“The recession changed everything, and we are just coming out of that on a global basis,” said Gaines-Ross.Another reason for the change has to do with the way chief executives are hired these days, said George, the former Medtronic CEO, who is a fellow at Harvard Business School and who writes frequently about what he calls authentic leadership. About 85 percent of chief executives are hired from within their company, he said, and ""boards don’t easily get fooled by internal candidates.""George was careful to note that arrogant CEOs aren’t yet extinct. “Wall Street is a little behind,” he said. “There’s so much ego there. Big ego.”It’s worth noting that the shift in leadership style has coincided with the rise and influence of women in the business world. “Women do tend to be more down-to-earth and genuine,” said George. “But I don’t think this is a gender thing.” There are women who embody the old style, too, he said. (They seem to be pretty rare, though, considering less than 5 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women.)What's really turned the tide in favor of positive human traits in the corner office is social media. Like other public figures, CEOs can’t escape the ubiquity of Twitter, Facebook, iPhone videos and the rest. If they make a misstep, the world will know. Their employees will know. They will demand answers and apologies. Chip Wilson, co-founder of Lululemon, was vilified on Twitter and Facebook in 2013 after he said that some women didn’t belong in the company’s yoga pants. He ended up leaving the company. The arrogant superstar CEO was probably best embodied by GE’s Welch, a hard-charging “celebrity CEO” who famously fired the company's bottom 10 percent of performers every year. The strategy, which was replicated elsewhere, didn’t exactly win the hearts and minds of his employees. Welch’s GE was “where the weak went to the wall and only the strong survived,” as one columnist wrote at Forbes earlier this year.“It is really hard to find a celebrity CEO these days,” said Gaines-Ross. “Trump is one of the very few.”When HuffPost asked whether Trump -- whose campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article -- was doing well reputationally, Gaines-Ross laughed.“No,"" she said."

Spurred by the rapid expansion of food-delivery services, online food ordering is set to overtake traditional telephone orders for the first time, according to new data from market research firm NPD. In just five years, the number of online orders has skyrocketed, doubling from around 403 million in 2010 to 904 million by May 2015, Quartz reported.""Online ordering offers a level of ease and convenience that phone ordering can’t match,"" a spokeswoman for GrubHub Inc., which owns popular sites GrubHub and Seamless, told The Huffington Post in an emailed statement. ""It provides users and restaurants with a quicker, more efficient way to place and process orders.""The company currently processes about 1.6 million orders a week, she said.More than $1.5 billion in delivery and pickup orders were made last year were via GrubHub Inc., which held 61 percent of the online ordering market. The company takes an average cut of 13.5 percent of all orders made through its system, and revenue is expected to jump to $2.6 billion by 2016.All of that attention has translated into some serious funding. Food- and grocery-delivery companies garnered more than $1 billion in venture capital injections in 2014, and another $500 billion has been thrown behind the services in the first quarter of this year, according to TechCrunch.Quartz notes that other delivery services like Caviar, which caters to a more exclusive list of curated restaurants, and Postmates are expected to eat into the GrubHub empire in the coming years.Capitalism that benefits the hungry?"

Stay",2015-07-20,"<p>SALT LAKE CITY, UT - JUNE 24: Kate Kelly, founder of Ordain Women, poses for a picture on June 24, 2014 in Salt Lake City, Utah. Kelly was excommunicated from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Mormon for apostasy when she refused to stop her movement to ordain women in the Mormon church.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ad66711500002d00173971.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was excommunicated from the Mormon church just over a year ago, I was widely quoted as saying, “Don’t leave. Stay, and make things better.”Many felt that asking women to stay in a church that doesn’t value them as equals was confusing and dangerous. While probably true, at the time I was torn. I didn’t want them to succeed in forcing us out of a space we had fought so hard to claim.Just this past week a young woman, heartsick and exhausted over the treatment of LDS women, contacted me for advice. She remembered my thoughts to “stay and make things better,” and was determined to do just that. However, when I originally made that statement, I, too, was hurting and exhausted. I hadn’t had time to experience the wonderful resolution and beauty that exist outside of Mormonism.It is a refreshing discovery to experience the easy peace that comes when you stop struggling to reconcile your heart with a faith community that devalues you.I let her know that staying is not the only honorable choice.The decision for a person to stay active in the Mormon church should be based on an honest evaluation of its benefits, and not fear.The popular home-organizing guru Marie Kondo offers some tips that seem applicable to organizing your spiritual life as well as your shelves. In every quest to de-clutter your living spaces, she encourages people to take out every possession they own and examine it. When deciding to keep or get rid of any given item, Kondo encourages the aspiring de-clutterer to ask themselves: “Does it spark joy?” If the item does not spark joy, it should be discarded to free up space.I encourage Mormon women to ask themselves a similar question: does my participation in Mormonism spark joy?I’ve had a year since my excommunication to reflect on my personal answer to this question, but embracing the result has been empowering.While serving a Mormon mission in Barcelona, Spain, I bought a puffed-sleeve T-shirt with the words in swirly cursive “Stop believing things that are not true” across the chest. At the time, I arrogantly thought of it as funny because I was proselyting that Mormonism was the one true church with a monopoly on truth and goodness. My affinity for that saying has changed over my journey, as it now inspires me to be honest about whether Mormonism sparks joy for me.It is like discovering air in your lungs for the first time, to let go of the heavy burden of dogma and injustices that act like ritual in Mormonism’s charade to assure us that all are equal. The price of agony needn’t be paid to a church that isn’t willing to hear you and hold you in that pain. They don’t deserve your anguish.It has been indescribably freeing for me to stop believing that men have control over whether or not I go to heaven. They don’t. In excommunicating me and continuing to punish others, male leaders of the church are gambling on a future of controlled obedience.It won’t work. We tried to make a middle space where authenticity and orthodoxy could co-exist. Church leaders rejected that. Therefore, it’s not a sign of defeat or weakness to leave an institution that causes you pain. It’s quite the opposite.I don’t wish for Mormon women to follow me — or to follow anyone. I want them to follow their own hearts, aspirations and dreams. Sometimes the culmination of that journey will lead them out of the church — and that’s O.K.! There is hope and joy to be found in abundance outside of Mormonism. There is calm and rest for your soul, and equal opportunities for your daughters. For many women the safer and more peaceful choice is to leave the church.Give yourself permission to make the best choice for you and your own wellbeing. Put your faith in yourself and in women.Always remember, you have power. You can exercise that power by sending a message to the church and voting with your feet. You can remove your name from the records of the church as a way to communicate to male church leaders why they can’t keep you or others like you. This has been my husband’s choice, and for many, many people I respect and admire.A mass resignation event is scheduled in Salt Lake City at City Creek Park on Saturday, July 25, at 2 p.m. I think it is important to register dissent and let church leaders know the cost of their rigidity.In the end, there is no one true way to dismantle patriarchy. It will take both people on the inside continuing to agitate and people leaving the church and marking their dissent to facilitate the necessary equality overhaul of Mormonism. But, no one should be made to unduly suffer for the cause of religious parity.Male leaders colonized our minds to make us think we had to play by their rules to be taken seriously. But, we don’t have to stay and “endure all things” for our critiques of the patriarchal system, and the harm it causes, to be valid. Our level of orthodoxy does not determine the legitimacy of our thoughts, desires, concerns and demands.After a year, the version of me who wants to urge people to stay has evolved.I wish now to amend my original advice: If the church does not “spark joy” in you, leave with your head held high.(Kate Kelly is a co-founder and former board member of Ordain Women.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) during a news conference Saturday -- but things got heated when he started bickering with reporters. The real estate mogul-turned-presidential-candidate took questions from reporters following his comments at the Family Leadership Summit in which he questioned whether Arizona Sen. John McCain (R) was a war hero. In a fiery exchange with reporters, Trump raised his voice, often interrupting before a full question was asked. At one point, he even yelled at one journalist, telling him to “go back to being a pundit.” ""If a person is captured, they're a hero as far as I'm concerned,"" Trump said. ""But you have to do other things also. I don't like the job John McCain is doing in the Senate. He's not taking care of our veterans.”Trump went back and forth with reporters, trying to clarify his statements, but the businessman kept giving different answers as if there was some confusion.“I like the people who don’t get captured and you have many people who didn’t get captured, I respect them greatly,” he said.When asked about his multiple student deferments and a medical deferment, which allowed him to avoid service, Trump said “millions of other people” took the same option.“I was going to college and got student deferments,” Trump said to a swarm of media. “It’s a long time ago, student deferments and ultimately a medical deferment because of my feet. I had a bone spur.”Trump even went on to say he “wasn’t a big fan” of the Vietnam War and had many friends that served and many that also had student deferments.“I wasn’t a protester, but the Vietnam war was a disaster for our country. What did we get out of the war other than death,” Trump said.When asked if he would apologize to the Arizona senator, Trump refused."

But to Disney and Lucasfilm, the magazine shoot is no laughing matter. After a Twitter user expressed disdain over the use of the ""Star Wars"" characters in Schumer's salacious spread, the official Star Wars Twitter account responded on Thursday. Turns out the franchise's studios weren't fans of the antics, either: Oh snap, some intergalactic shots fired. At least the comedian has Luke Skywalker's blessing:And for what it's worth, R2-D2 and C-3Po seemed to enjoy Schumer's company in this NSFW video:We'd say the force is still with Schumer.
