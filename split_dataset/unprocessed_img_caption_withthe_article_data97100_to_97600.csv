0,BUSINESS,Behind The UK's Tech Boom: 7 Factors Attracting Startups,Mallory Moyer,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uk-europes-tech-hub_n_6614744.html,,2015-02-11,"Exhibitors promote their business start-up companies in the main hall titled 'Startup Alley' at the Disrupt Europe 2014 conference in London, U.K., on Monday, Oct. 20, 2014. The TechCrunch event features representatives from global start-up companies involved in industries including medical diagnostics, enterprise mobile tools, and financial technology.

Any guesses where we’re talking about? It’s not the United States. It’s not Germany. It’s the United Kingdom. And the mounting tech explosion isn’t confined to London; the entire U.K. is quickly becoming Europe’s next big tech hub. We’ve partnered with the HQ-UK team, a new initiative to encourage and assist international tech businesses to expand in the U.K., to bring you these seven reasons why: 1. A highly skilled and educated workforceIt’s hard to argue with both size and smarts. More than 64 million people live in the U.K., and in the most recent Global Talent Competitiveness Index -- which ranks countries based on their “ability to attract and incubate talent” -- the U.K. emerged as one of the world’s highest-rated powerhouse economies, placing seventh among the 93 countries studied. There is also a strong culture of education: The U.K. topped the 2013/2014 QS World University Rankings and boasts three of the world’s top 10 universities, according to the latest Times Higher Education World University Rankings.2. Gateway to Europe (and the world)The U.K. has a prime location with easy access to both the United States and the rest of Europe’s nearly 680 million people. On average, around 6,000 flights go in and out of the U.K. per day, with London’s five (yes, five) major airports offering direct flights to a multitude of destinations. Extensive ground transportation options are also available for domestic and international travel -- you can even take a train to Paris in less than three hours. So although the U.K. hangs out in the Atlantic, it doesn’t stand alone. Its central location and comprehensive transportation network make it an attractive base for international expansion. Not to mention it’s in between the time zones of the U.S. and Asia, which makes workday conference calls a lot easier to organize. 3. A vibrant culture and expat communityThe Royals. Wimbledon. “Downton Abbey.” Fish and chips. Radiohead. Though it’s a small country, the U.K. has no shortage of culture. Entrepreneurs and employees who live there enjoy the many unique aspects of modern life in the U.K. -- from food to art to music, it has something for everyone.Not only does the U.K. keep its 64 million subjects well entertained, it’s also home to a large expat community. Almost 8 million people in the U.K. were born abroad, accounting for over 12 percent of the population. Most U.K. cities have vibrant expat communities, including large numbers of people from the U.S. (Apart from the free healthcare, the culture and the countryside, many American expats say that the traditional British pub is one of the U.K.’s most cherished gifts to the world.) And with English as the national language, it’s easy to do business -- no matter where you’re from.4. Business-friendly tax lawsOver the past decade, the U.K. has worked hard to make the tax environment friendly for new businesses. The country’s corporate tax rate has dropped by 9 percent in the past nine years: from April 1 it will stand at 20 percent -- which is half the corporate tax rate in the U.S. and the lowest among G7 nations.Other features of the U.K. tax regime that appeal to international businesses include a territorial system that focuses on only taxing profits earned in the U.K., a “patent box” tax rate of 10 percent on profits earned from U.K.- or European Union–originating patents, and a generous research and development tax credit. U.K.-based businesses are also not required to pay any duties when moving goods within the EU. 5. Buzzing with tech clustersThe U.K. government is throwing a lot of support behind growing the technology industry within its borders: in 2012, it established the Tech City initiative in East London to promote and develop the tech ecosystem. It is now home to over 3,200 tech companies and cited as one of the hottest locations in the tech world right now. However, although many think of London as the heart of the U.K. tech boom, a significant percentage of the digital economy is actually based outside the city. Twenty-one digital clusters -- where businesses gather to leverage collective expertise to accelerate growth -- are currently thriving throughout the U.K., according to a recent Tech Nation report. These clusters are evidence of some of the best conditions for business builders anywhere in the world. Along with better-known hubs like Cambridge, Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle, some of the newest tech clusters are also among the fastest-growing. Bournemouth, a south coast town, is doubling its digital technology businesses year on year; Birmingham is now home to a quarter of the U.K.’s workforce employed in games development; and Edinburgh, part of “Silicon Glen,” is home to world-class talent in the field of Fintech. 6. Poised (and protected) for business growthIt can take as little as 24 hours to register a U.K. company and just six days to start up. It’s not surprising that three times more companies choose to base themselves in the U.K. over other European nations. The U.K. government is also taking growing concerns over cyber security very seriously; through a £860 million investment in a National Cyber Security Programme to combat cyber threats, the country is well positioned to become one of the safest places in the world to do business, digital and otherwise. 7. A community of success storiesBetween 2009 and 2012, the number of technology companies incorporated in London increased by 76 percent, and in the most recent years, 15 percent of the companies formed in the U.K. were digital. Just two years ago, Yahoo acquired U.K. startup Summly for $30 million; some of today’s most promising U.K. startups include Shazam, YPlan, TransferWise, SwiftKey and GoCardless. Of all the U.K.’s tech companies, 90 percent expect revenue to grow next year. This community of existing tech startups has fostered a welcoming environment for new companies on the scene. And, clearly, business is booming. A tech company considering international expansion? Choose the U.K. as the location of your international HQ, and HQ-UK can help you every step of the way. HQ-UK includes a special concierge service for tech companies choosing to set up an international HQ in the U.K. Visit www.techcityuk.com/hquk for more information. HQ-UK is a joint initiative between UK Trade & Investment, the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills, the Department for Culture, Media & Sport and Tech City UK."
1,HEALTHY LIVING,The Secret Life of an Image Consultant With a Nut Allergy,"Carol Brailey, ContributorImage Consultant and Color Analysis Professional; Carol Braile...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-secret-life-of-an-ima_b_6632670.html,,2015-02-11,2015-02-10-RandalGordyLee_NutAllergyKissIllustration.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-10-RandalGordyLee_NutAllergyKissIllustration-thumb.jpg," Illustration by Randal Gordy LeeI'm an image consultant who has a not-so-stylish severe nut allergy. I am allergic to all nuts including peanuts; the smell of nuts impacts me and I carry an EpiPen. My work takes me all over the city some days and I deal with multiple clients in any given work day. It's sometimes a tricky task to stay out of harm's way with a nut allergy when you are on the go. Not only do I need to be aware of what I ingest, I also have to be aware of what is going on in my immediate surroundings. As I was going about my day the other day, I had a realization -- I have thoughts throughout my day that only those with a nut allergy can fully comprehend. For the last few days I've started to make myself more aware of and track my ""nutty"" experiences and thoughts to share with you. These are my norm every day and have been my norm every day for most of my life.When I first found out that I had a nut allergy, I was very nonchalant about it and would take risks all the time. Now after a couple of allergic reaction scares that have landed me in the hospital, I've inadvertently put into place these thought patterns as a safety mechanism.I'm sharing these thoughts to...- Raise awareness - If you have a nut allergy and have similar thoughts -- I'm hoping to remove your sense of isolation - If you have a loved one with a nut allergy -- perhaps this will give you some insight on what they may be thinking as they go about their daySo without further ado here are a sample of my experiences and inner thoughts as I go about my day while defending my body from its dreaded nut allergy.Morning Coffee Shop Stop A common routine for many that I try to avoid due to the high likelihood of nut products in many coffee shops.If I am in a rush in the morning and don't have time for coffee and breakfast before I leave home, I will only ever purchase a coffee while out and skip the breakfast part. Muffins, pastries and most baked breads are frightening to me.If I do grab a coffee while out, I've had the following ""nutty"" thoughts -- Is there nut residue on my cup? Do they make nut-based coffees such as hazelnut? Is it possible hazelnut made it through to my coffee?Public Transit I live downtown in a major city and most of my work is in the downtown core. Public transit is really the only logical option to choose to quickly get around as I go about my day.Here are some of the ""nutty"" experiences and thoughts I have while on public transit.- If I hear a wrapper being opened around me -- I will immediately decipher what is being opened to see if it is a nut-based item. If it is nut-based, I will move to a different area. - If there is a wrapper on a seat, I won't touch it or sit there. - Because I am sensitive to the smell of nuts, I immediately can smell if someone near me had nuts recently to eat -- I will move away from them because the smell is very bothersome to me. - Slightly off topic: I have been on a plane when someone beside me started eating nuts. I immediately got out of my seat, talked to the flight attendant so that I could arrange to sit in another section of the plane. My worst nightmare -- having an allergic reaction on a plane!Client Engagements, Out Shopping Etc. Here are some of the ""nutty"" experiences and thoughts when I'm out and about. [A couple points below perhaps point out a need for a new set of etiquette rules required for people with nut allergies when dealing with those without nut allergies.]- At the hair salon: I have had to tell clients who were about to eat a nut product in my chair that I am allergic and kindly ask them to put the product away (I feel just awful when I have to ask them to do this!). - If I'm shopping with a client and they want to stop for a bite to eat -- I always let them choose the place. If they choose somewhere where there is a high probability of nut products -- I politely say I am not that hungry and only order a drink (even though more than likely I am starving!). - If I'm not with a client, I will grab something quick on the go that more often than not is unhealthy, but, labeled (i.e., bag of chips, chocolate bar etc.) -- logical or not -- I feel safer eating labeled items vs. risking eating something like an un-labelled salad somewhere.Eating a Meal Out (At End of Day) If it's been a long day, I typically will grab something for dinner on the way home. I always go to the same places and stick to the same orders that have not caused me problems. I rarely will try a new restaurant or new menu item, quite simply to mitigate risks and risks of adding more ""nutty"" thoughts to my repertoire -- it gets tiring.End of Night Kiss The perfect way to end a lovely evening -- a wonderful spontaneous kiss -- stopped by the always sexy question -- ""Did you have nuts today or recently""? Which is then followed by a long pause and sometimes his eyes look away as he thinks through his food intake for the day.My home is a nut-free zone so really the ""nutty"" thoughts, questions and experiences above stop once I'm at home. So there you have a sample of some of my experiences and thoughts as I go about my day to avoid contact with nuts. I could write pages upon pages of additional ""nutty"" experiences and thoughts and write about additional experiences during other activities such as a visit to the grocery store, shopping for makeup, out in public in general, shopping for lotions or creams, at a baseball game etc. If you have a nut allergy, I am sure you can imagine most, if not all of the thoughts that could be placed on these ""additional pages.""I truly hope this blog has raised awareness and starts some conversation / further understanding if you or your loved one(s) are impacted by a nut allergy.I hope this blog inspires you to wear your authenticity!Carol Brailey is an Image Consultant who specializes in color analysis.

2,POLITICS,Bill To Restore Voting Rights Act Gets Another Bipartisan Push,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/voting-rights-act-bipartisan-bill_n_6598062.html,,2015-02-11,"WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 16: (L to R) U.S. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) are seen during a news conference on Capitol Hill, January 16, 2014 in Washington, DC. The group of lawmakers announced that they are introducing legislation, the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014, that would restore keys parts of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e6d32500008b013a5907.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House lawmakers are giving another push to legislation that went nowhere in the last Congress: a bill to restore the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.The bill, introduced Wednesday by Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) and John Conyers (D-Mich.), responds to the Supreme Court ruling that struck down Section 4 of the law in 2013. In a 5-4 vote, the court declared it was time to update the section, which determined which states and localities with a history of minority voter suppression had to clear changes to their voting laws with the Justice Department. The justices left it up to Congress to come up with a new formula for designating which regions of the country require special scrutiny. The Sensenbrenner-Conyers bill, known as the Voting Rights Amendment Act, updates that formula by making it apply to all states and jurisdictions with voting violations in the past 15 years, and by creating uniform transparency requirements to keep communities informed about voting changes.The legislation actually expands the Voting Rights Act, too, by giving more power to federal courts to stop discriminatory voting changes before they are implemented. Specifically, it would lower the bar for plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a law in any federal court.“The VRA is one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation ever passed,"" said Sensenbrenner. ""Our legitimacy as elected officials relies on the integrity of the ballot box. I urge my colleagues to support the VRAA because it is vital to our commitment to never again allow racial prejudices in the electoral process.""Sensenbrenner and Conyers introduced the same bill in the last Congress, and it never even made it out of committee. Its prospects in this Congress aren't looking great either. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said last month that Republicans have concluded it's not ""necessary"" to restore the law because it's strong enough without Section 4.A major obstacle for the bill continues to be its lack of GOP supporters. Aside from Sensenbrenner, the House bill had only 11 GOP co-sponsors in the last Congress. This time, as of Wednesday afternoon, it has only three: Reps. Charlie Dent (Pa.), Michael Fitzpatrick (Pa.) and Chris Gibson (N.Y.). That means seven Republicans have dropped off since last year, including Reps. Steve Chabot (Ohio), Sean Duffy (Wis.), Fred Upton (Mich.), Luke Messer (Ind.), Dave Reichert (Wash.), Frank LoBiondo (N.J.) and Michael Turner (Ohio). Its other former GOP co-sponsor, Rep. Spencer Bachus (Ala.), retired. The Huffington Post reached out to the former GOP co-sponsors to clarify whether they planned to sign on. A LoBiondo spokesman said the New Jersey lawmaker, for one, hadn't been asked to support it. An Upton spokeswoman said Friday that the congressman will co-sponsor the bill again.House Democrats on the bill include Reps. Steny Hoyer (Md.), John Lewis (Ga.), Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), Bobby Scott (Va.), Sheila Jackson Lee (Texas), Steve Cohen (Tenn.), Hank Johnson (Ga.), Judy Chu (Calif.), Cedric Richmond (La.), David Cicilline (R.I.), Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Scott Peters (Calif.), Zoe Lofgren (Calif.) and Karen Bass (Calif.) and Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi (P.R.).Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) plans to reintroduce the Senate legislation. It didn't have any GOP co-sponsors in the last Congress and is unclear if it will this time.""I will continue to work to find a Senate Republican to join me in introducing bipartisan legislation to restore this landmark law so that every Americans’ right to vote is protected,"" Leahy said.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has called it ""offensive"" that Republicans won't act on the issue. Last month, she drew a connection between the GOP's unwillingness to address voting rights and the recent controversy over a speech House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) gave to a white supremacist group.""If you look at what Mr. Scalise said, in the context of no voting rights bill and no immigration bill, you start to see an attitude,"" Pelosi said. ""That really is bothersome.""UPDATE: Messer and LoBiondo later added their names to the bill.This post has also been updated to note Upton's position on the bill."
3,POLITICS,Citizens Jewnited: Meet The Israeli Grassroots Group Seeking To Unseat Netanyahu,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/israeli-elections-_n_6646854.html,,2015-02-11,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting in his Jerusalem office, Sunday, Jan. 25, 2015. Israel's premier says he will go ""anywhere"" he is invited to speak about the country's stance regarding Iran's nuclear program. (AP Photo/Baz Ratner, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e810220000bb01dd8138.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A nonpartisan grassroots group in Israel has come under fire from conservative Jews -- in both Israel and in the U.S. -- for using American funds and expertise in its efforts to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But the group, V15, is undeterred by the controversy, and is pushing forward with a social justice-focused campaign that aims to replace the coalition government currently led by Netanyahu's Likud party.V15's corps of enthusiastic millennial organizers espouse Obama-style concepts like “hope” and “change” to argue that successive Netanyahu-led coalitions have only resulted in despair and an inability to confront the country’s biggest problems. Ahead of the March 17 elections, the group is recruiting thousands of volunteers to boost turnout among left-leaning Israelis. V15 -- the ""V"" stands for ""victory"" -- drew criticism recently when it hired Jeremy Bird, President Barack Obama’s former national field director. Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, even linked Bird's hiring to the dispute between Netanyahu and the Obama administration over the Israeli leader's planned visit to the United States.“It is simply hypocrisy and interference in Israel’s elections for President Obama to say that he will not meet with the Israeli Prime Minister because Israeli elections are too close, while his closest electoral advisers suddenly appear in Israel for the sole purpose of leading a campaign to unseat the Israeli Prime Minister,” Klein said in a statement in January. But Bird, who is working with V15 through the consulting group 270 Strategies, said on Tuesday that he was enthusiastic about the possibility of harnessing the thirst for change in Israel. ""We're witnessing something special happening in Israel right now -- there's a groundswell of organic energy and a growing number of grassroots supporters speaking out for change,"" Bird told The Huffington Post. ""We're inspired by their passion -- that's why we were honored to be asked by V15 and its partners to share best practices in organizing so they can maximize their impact both online and on the ground and provide these volunteers with an experience that respects their time and values.""Bird's work with V15 centers on volunteer recruitment and training. The group says thousands of volunteers will be needed to knock on doors in liberal strongholds in order to elect enough center-left seats to oust the Netanyahu-led government.Nimrod Dweck, the co-founder of V15, said Bird’s guidance had been “extremely helpful."" Dweck contextualized his group’s efforts in the tradition of Israel's massive social justice-oriented protests in 2011, when more than 400,000 took to the streets to protest the rising cost of living. Despite the energy generated by those protests, in the next elections, which took place in 2013, Likud still managed to win enough seats to head the government.“People were very disturbed about it -- we had a dream and the dream didn’t prevail,” Dweck said of Likud's 2013 victory. “Look, now’s our time, we know what we have to do.”A second controversy surrounding V15's efforts has to do with its relationship with the OneVoice Movement, a U.S.-based organization that advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. OneVoice and V15 announced in late January that they planned to merge. Critics of the groups are arguing that OneVoice may have improperly used federal funds to support V15 before the two groups cemented their partnership. Leading the delegitimization campaign in the U.S. are Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), who is the only Jewish Republican in Congress, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). In late January, the two sent a letter asking the State Department to investigate whether OneVoice violated its nonprofit status by using federal grant money to support its partnership with V15.The State Department says the grants, which were given to support OneVoice’s advocacy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, ended before Israel’s elections were even called. Across the Atlantic, Likud has filed a complaint with Israeli election officials alleging that V15 violated campaign finance laws by using foreign funds to support the main opposition coalition -- the Zionist Camp, led by Isaac Herzog of the Labor Party and Tzipi Livni of Hatnuah. It's true that the vast majority of V15’s funding has come from foreigners like Slim-Fast billionaire Daniel Abraham and and KIND bar entrepreneur Daniel Lubetsky, who are both are known for their support of a two-state solution. However, under Israeli law, it's not illegal for V15 to receive foreign support. Israeli State Comptroller Yosef Shapira disappointed Likud by saying Sunday that he would not investigate V15 before the election, explaining that a probe would have to establish that the group is linked to a specific political party.On Wednesday, Israel's attorney general rejected a Likud request to block V15 advertising, saying that the Central Elections Commission did not have the authority to grant such an injunction. OneVoice called the decision ""the strongest repudiation yet of the ongoing efforts by the political elites to spread misinformation about OneVoice Israel and V15."" Both V15 and the Zionist Camp have vigorously denied any affiliation. V15 insists that its goal is to replace the current government, not to advocate on behalf of any particular party.Given that the majority of Netanyahu’s donations during the Likud primary contest came from Americans, some are skeptical of the party's accusations against V15. ""All of his donors are American,"" Dweck said of Netanyahu. ""It's very hypocritical for him to say such a thing."" Moreover, this year, Likud hired Vincent Harris, a Republican political strategist who has previously worked for Cruz, to advise the party’s new media team. Indeed, both Bird and Harris have joined an American political tradition of advising Israeli political organizations. The practice stretches back to the early 1980s, when both former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Labor Party leader Shimon Peres brought on American political consultants. Dweck suggested that Likud’s attacks were backfiring. “They gave us amazing publicity, because now when I introduce myself, they know who we are, what we are doing. I don’t have to spend 5 minutes explaining,” he said. Mitchell Barak, the head of Keevoon Research Strategy and Communications, an Israeli political consulting firm, told HuffPost he wasn’t certain V15’s efforts would be successful. He pointed to the large number of Israelis who tend to remain undecided until Election Day, and said that the country's parliamentary, coalition-based system can often lead to unhappy marriages of parties with radically different agendas. “Netanyahu may not be leaving even if they vote for another person,” Barak noted. Barak suggested that V15’s “negative get-out-the-vote campaign” against Netanyahu could flounder, and that, ironically, the group's messaging resembles what Netanyahu has said in past campaigns. “The right-of-center voters are the ones that always respond to the doom and gloom,” he said. “Netanyahu always says, ‘I’m the only one who can save Israel, and save you, and if you vote for someone else, we’re going to die.’”And even if voters are disappointed by Netanyahu’s leadership, Barak said, Israeli's numerous other political parties may not necessarily project convincing prime-ministerial bona fides. “At the end of the day, it’s nice to talk about an alternative, but you’ve got to say something,” Barak said. “They’re saying, ‘Let’s vote for change,’ but there’s no message. Israelis may ask, ‘Change for what? What are we getting?’”This story has been updated to include detail about the Israeli attorney general's rejection of Likud's request."

(Photo by Jordan Pix/ Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6110ddba280000d9b77043eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AMMAN - The excruciating death of our pilot, Muath al-Kaseasbeh, at the hands of Daesh/ISIS militants has rallied Jordanians and the world at large. Much like ""Je suis Charlie,"" ""We are all Muath"" as well. The truth of these proclamations is evident but the mission to which they call us is more intricate and transformative than the international media portrays. For we Jordanians know more than most that progress in fighting fanaticism does not come from exacting revenge on individuals. To be sure, we will struggle against such evil, and we will win. But the issue of our people, our neighbors and our friends being targets of extremism is not a new phenomenon. From the heinous terrorist bomb attacks on our hotels in Amman that claimed over 60 lives in 2005 to the recurring cycles of violence throughout the region that have displaced millions of Palestinians, Egyptians, Iraqis and Syrians inside our borders, Jordan has faced the consequences of asymmetric warfare every decade. We understand that eradicating extremism, including this latest evil that we see in Daesh, requires that we address socio-historical conditions that continue to marginalize and demean Arab youth and their communities in West Asia, North Africa, Europe and beyond.The Jordanian government has recently made strong statements about the scope of Jordan's retaliation with ""just the beginning"" of its ""multiple targets."" Reminded of Rev. Martin Luther King, I speak now ""with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision"" in order to stress the importance of internationalism and making connections across borders to see global struggles as our own. Our approach to fighting such oppression must be founded on an ethic of human solidarity that is broader than Jordan. This attack on multiple targets must be made in conjunction with the support of network intelligence gathering from Boko Haram to Raqqa and to a multitude of universal targets. It is how we will learn to differentiate when we talk to sleepers inside our region, through moral and not just military re-armament.At the core of these efforts is the patent truth that real security is human security, one that takes a long-range view of human welfare and addresses long-term issues of poverty and injustice and not only the short-term causes of particular violent conflicts. For millions of people, structural violence has become a fact of life; their suffering -- the banality of their pain -- is the inevitable product of the postcolonial debris with which nation states in our region continue to grapple with to this day. That some, like Afghanistan and Iraq, have all but failed, and others, like Syria, have succumbed to state violence has eroded people's trust in states' capacity for social management. When we read that some 3,000 so-called ""European jihadists,"" or ""war tourists"" as Paul Collier has aptly put it, have joined Daesh, we must remember that it is this socio-political, and not a religious, vacuum that groups like Daesh are filling with their platform of populist hatred. These state and social failures apply to Europe too. As Juan Cole, Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan, recently commented in response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks, ""Al-Qaeda wants to mentally colonize French Muslims, but faces a wall of disinterest. But if it can get non-Muslim French to be beastly to ethnic Muslims on the grounds that they are Muslims, it can start creating a common political identity around grievance against discrimination."" The sensationalist tendencies of our contemporary global media have offered an ideal echo chamber for the warped and corrupt ideologies of these militant groups. We must better utilize this echo chamber to put forth convincing ideologies that strengthen the possibility for human solidarity. The European Neighborhood Policy, which attempts to tie the periphery to the center, is a good attempt at governance, but it stops short. European policymakers must comprehend that good neighborliness does not only take place between countries, but also between communities. Inter-existence with Muslims in European cities, but also with other groups such as Ukrainians, is as important a practice of good governance and good neighborliness as fostering good Eurasian relations. So the citizens of Europe as well as of West Asia and North Africa, Arabs and non-Arabs, followers of all faiths, must stand up and be counted. An ethic of human solidarity, of humanitarianism, must take us both beyond and in the midst of national allegiances in order to present a convincing alternative to the nihilistic, but unfortunately uniting, ideologies of radical and militant groups like Boko Haram, Daesh and Ansar Bayt Al Maqdis. They are appealing to the millions of people who have sunk into the depths of absolute deprivation precisely because they traverse the national borders that they, victimized by structural violence, hold responsible for their captivity into poverty and injustice.In Jordan, it means not forgetting about the alienated Syrian and Jordanian children who have been rendered vulnerable. Human development, specifically through long-term education plans and inclusive community centers that seek to change attitudes, is the ultimate goal of our national development. It is the ultimate goal of imaginative long-term international policies that must help and include the desperate, rejected and angry young men and women from the Parisian banlieues to Raqqa, Syria. This broader context for good neighborhood policies throws into relief the very qualities of inter-existence, mutual obligation and a reasonable level of tolerance whereby these borders are markers of our respective cultural specificities but not hindrances to practices of solidarity and reciprocity. Our problems are not new. The faces of the unvirtuous who exploit these problems for remapping power and wealth do change, but the root causes remain predictable. Hasn't the time arrived for us to revive an inter-disciplinary and eco-social framework for a world humanitarian order?Inequalities that are incompatible with human dignity anywhere are politically, socially and economically destabilizing everywhere. We need to find out how people, the disenfranchised, think, and we must think with them towards long-term solutions, in good times and in bad.

Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) told the Huffington Post on Tuesday that he was buoyed the growing number of signatories on his letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), urging that Netanyahu's appearance be postponed until after the U.S. finishes diplomatic negotiations with Iran, as well as announcements from some senior Democrats that they would skip the Netanyahu speech. The speech, still scheduled for March 3, did not come up during a meeting between members of the Congressional Black Caucus and President Barack Obama on Tuesday afternoon. But it was discussed among members who filtered out of the West Wing after the 1 1/2-hour talk.“We are above 20 now,” said Ellison, referring to signers of his letter. “But the more interesting development is the large number of people saying they’re not going. Obviously I’m not going. I’m trying to postpone the thing altogether. But Rep. G.K. Butterfield, chair of the Black Caucus, said he’s not going. There is just this growing number of people who are not going to go. So, it is actually, you know, a real mistake on behalf of Speaker Boehner.” Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.), who has said that he, too, would skip the speech, told The Huffington Post that he was hopeful that “it won’t be necessary for [others] to make that decision” of whether to attend. “I’ve been trying to think of some good that can come out of it and I can’t imagine as a long friend and supporter of Israel, I don’t know why they would participate in what appears to be a partisan political scheme, if you will,” Rangel said. The effort to dissuade Netanyahu from showing (or to convince Boehner to rescind the invitation) has been aided, in part, by outside groups. Ellison said the liberal Israel advocacy group J Street had been pushing his letter to offices on the Hill, along with “community groups interested in moving it.“But Netanyahu so far has given no indication of backing off plans for the speech. ""A bad deal with Iran is forming in Munich that will endanger Israel's existence,"" Netanyahu said at an event for his Likud Party. ""Therefore, I am determined to go to Washington and present Israel's position before the members of Congress and the American people."""

""My sense is that the Supreme Court is about to make a shift, one that I welcome, which is to recognize that -- having hit a critical mass of states that have recognized same-sex marriage -- it doesn't make sense for us to now have this patchwork system,"" Obama told BuzzFeed News. ""It's time to recognize that under the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, same-sex couples should have the same rights as anybody else.""On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to put a hold on same-sex marriages in Alabama, where a federal judge recently struck down the state's previous ban on gay marriage. As Justice Clarence Thomas noted in his dissent, the move signals that the justices are likely to rule later this year that it is unconstitutional for any state to limit marriage to heterosexual couples. Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore made an 11th-hour attempt to stop the state's judges from issuing marriage licenses. The move drew comparisons to George Wallace, the former governor who was determined to keep Alabama schools from desegregating in the 1960s. In the BuzzFeed interview, Obama said the comparison to Wallace is not a ""perfect analogy,"" but like Wallace, Moore will need to accept the federal decision.""When federal law is in conflict with state law, federal law wins out,"" he said. Obama officially came out in favor of same-sex marriage in May 2012, just months before he was elected to a second term as president. According to a new book by longtime adviser David Axelrod, Obama personally supported legalizing gay marriage well before his announcement, but hid his stance out of political concerns.Obama addressed Axelrod's claims in the interview with BuzzFeed, saying he thinks his former adviser is ""mixing up"" his personal feelings with his position on the issue.“I always felt that same-sex couples should be able to enjoy the same rights, legally, as anybody else, and so it was frustrating to me not to, I think, be able to square that with what were a whole bunch of religious sensitivities out there,"" Obama said. ""So my thinking at the time was that civil unions — which I always supported — was a sufficient way of squaring the circle.”In October 2014, Obama's position shifted again, telling the New Yorker's Jeffrey Toobin he believes the 14th Amendment requires all states to allow same-sex couples to wed. “Ultimately, I think the Equal Protection Clause does guarantee same-sex marriage in all fifty states,” he said.Last month, Obama said he hoped the Supreme Court would rule as such.""My hope is that they go ahead and recognize what the majority of the American people now recognize,"" he said in an interview with YouTube star GloZell Green.This post has been updated to include comments from Obama on the claims from Axelrod's book."

The U.S. government says New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez paid his cousin almost $1 million to keep secret Rodriguez's use of performance enhancing drugs. In court documents filed last week in Miami, federal prosecutors say Rodriguez paid $900,000 last year to settle a threatened lawsuit by Yuri Sucart, who had worked as Rodriguez's personal assistant. Sucart, in a letter from his lawyer, threatened to expose Rodriquez's PED use if he wasn't paid $5 million.

A-Rod was suspended without pay for the entire 2014 season for his alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs. Initially suspended for 211 games midway through the 2013 season, he appealed and fought the league, the team and player's union, and then filed a number of lawsuits, which he later dropped. The suspension was ultimately reduced to 162 games, or the length of a complete baseball season. According to the New York Daily News, the Yankees told Rodriguez that his behavior was “entirely inappropriate throughout the summer of 2013” and warned that it would not be forgotten. The Yankees also asked him to address the media before pitchers and catchers report for spring training on Feb. 20, according to ESPN New York, which added that A-Rod was amenable to that timetable.Here's the full text of the statement, as cited by CBS Sports: ""Today we held a meeting at Yankee Stadium between Hal Steinbrenner, Randy Levine, Brian Cashman, Jean Afterman, Alex Rodriguez and Jim Sharp. Alex initiated the meeting and apologized to the organization for his actions over the past several years.Steinbrenner is managing general partner of the team, which is owned by his family. Levine is the team's president, Cashman the general manager and Afterman is the assistant GM. Sharp is A-Rod's attorney. Rodriguez is signed through 2017, with $61 million in salary remaining on the contract. In addition, the Yankees have a second contract with Rodriguez that will pay him up to $30 million more for reaching various home run milestones. The Yankees are reportedly looking to fight that contract, and the Associated Press reports that the team told Rodriguez at Tuesday's meeting that they do not feel obligated to pay it. In 2009, the three-time MVP admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs in 2001, 2002 and 2003 when he was with the Texas Rangers. He claimed he had been clean since. In his only public statements since the suspension, A-Rod has denied using performance-enhancing drugs after 2003. However, he reportedly admitted to using them from 2010-2012 during a January 2014 meeting with the Drug Enforcement Agency, according to the Miami Herald. "

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31b5d240000500097414c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For years people have been running around Washington yelling that the United States was at risk of becoming Greece. There may actually be a basis for such concerns, but not for the reason usually given. The standard story of the United States becoming Greece is that government budget deficits will result in a loss of confidence in the ability of the United States to meet its debt obligations. This will lead to skyrocketing interest rates, a financial panic, and rivers flowing upstream. While this view has many adherents among respectable people in Washington, reality refuses to cooperate. Instead of skyrocketing, the interest rate on U.S. government debt has plummeted. The interest rate on 10-year Treasury bonds is less than 2 percent, a sharp contrast from the days of budget surpluses in the late 1990s, when it hovered in the 5- to 6-percent range. In short, the deficit hawks have been shown to be completely wrong.But there is actually another way in which the United States could be like Greece, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership is directly connected. While Greece's budget problems have made headlines, its economy is actually more constrained by being trapped in the euro zone than by the restrictions on budget deficits. This has prevented the adjustment in relative prices that is needed to restore the competitiveness of Greece's economy.If Greece had still been on the drachma when the financial crisis hit in 2008, its currency would have plummeted as investors from the rest of Europe stopped lending the country money. That would have meant an unpleasant bout of inflation for the Greek people, but it also would have quickly restored the country's competitiveness. The simple story is that the price of Greek goods and services would fall relative to the price of goods and services produced elsewhere in proportion to the decline in the currency. This means that if the drachma had fallen by 30 percent relative to other currencies, Greek goods and services would cost 30-percent less compared with the price of goods and services produced in Germany, France, and elsewhere. In reality the picture is more complicated, since many inputs for Greek products are imported, but the basic story would hold. A decline in the value of the drachma would make Greek goods and services more competitive internationally. This would lead to an increase in exports and a decline in imports, which would provide a substantial boost to GDP, offsetting the effects of the crisis.Greece could not have this sort of adjustment process because it is part of the euro zone. This meant that there was no easy way for Greece to restore its international competitiveness. Instead of reducing its trade deficit by restoring its competitiveness with currency devaluation, it has reduced its trade deficit through economic contraction. When the economy shrinks, imports shrink, thereby lowering the trade deficit. Greece has now endured a contraction that dwarfs the Great Depression in severity. This story is connected to the Trans-Pacific Partnership because the United States also has had problems with bringing its trade deficit down by reducing the value of its currency. The United States began to run large trade deficits in the late 1990s, following the East Asian financial crisis. This was when countries in East Asia and elsewhere in the developing world first began to buy up large amounts of dollars in order to prop up the value of the dollar against their own currencies. Their goal was to boost their exports to the United States and other countries.Many of these countries, most notably China, continue this policy to the present day. They deliberately prop up the dollar in order to sustain their trade surpluses. Their trade surplus is the cause of our persistently large trade deficits. These trade deficits in turn have been a major drag on growth. The trade deficits are the main cause of the ""secular stagnation"" that has prevented us from having full employment except when the economy was driven by bubbles in the stock and housing markets.This brings us to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). This deal is not only important for the countries it includes but intended to be a pact that other countries will later join. The Obama administration decided not to include any language on currency values in the TPP. This will make it more difficult for the United States to take measures to get countries to stop propping up the dollar.The result could be the persistence long into the future of large U.S. trade deficits, with the resulting loss of demand and millions of jobs. This drag on growth may not give us the same sort of cataclysmic downturn that Greece has seen, but it is a much more real concern than the possibility that no one will buy U.S. government debt."
