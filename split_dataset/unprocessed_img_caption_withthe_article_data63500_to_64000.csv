0,POLITICS,"In A Houston Megachurch, Bad Omens For Trump And The GOP Come November",Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-megachurch-trump_us_56d47afde4b0bf0dab32d460,"At the Latino and youth services at Lakewood Church, fans of The Donald are hard to find.",2016-02-29,Evangelical worshippers are seen at Lakewood Church in Houston.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d48e391500007f000b0f15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HOUSTON -- If today’s Republican Party had a mother church, it might be Joel Osteen’s suburban Lakewood Church, an evangelical outreach machine with an arena sanctuary, 50,000 members and a service on Sirius radio, so that you can be saved via satellite.It’s also a good place to see where the GOP’s 36-year-old Reagan-built base is becoming outmoded, like the Brutalist architecture of the downtown buildings here and the shabby concrete on the triple-decker highway overpasses.In many ways, Donald Trump is the logical summation and endpoint of a Republican Party built primarily on the support of straight, church-going white people, especially in the South.And interviews with some of the Lakewood faithful suggest that if Trump is the GOP presidential nominee, that demographic could well become a prison from which there would be no escape other than a woman named Hillary in the White House.After Mitt Romney’s loss in 2012, the Republican National Committee published a blunt self-analysis, insisting that the party would face doom if it did not massively reach out to Latinos, gay people, millennials and the rest of the remixed society of 21st-century America.At Lakewood, where the main interest is saving souls wherever you can find them and whatever they look like, they understand what the GOP analysts were saying.A recent youth service in the early evening looked like any concert scene, except that of the thousands of young people in the rows and aisles, some were clutching dog-eared study Bibles as they swayed to loud country-rock tunes about being saved.It was a hip, integrated young crowd: interracial couples, plenty of piercings, hobnail boots, neon hair. And no love for Trump.“As far as I’m concerned, he’s a fringe candidate,” said Charlie Hurd, 26, a former college basketball player who now teaches elementary school gym. He sat in a side row with a Bible open on his lap.“His whole thing is to say nasty things and not offer anything real,"" Hurd said. ""And the things he is offering aren’t going to help.”Preston Jameson, 24, a mattress store manager, said that he was sticking with home-state Sen. Ted Cruz in part because he doesn’t buy the idea that Trump is a real Christian, given his bluster and bitter antagonisms. “I want a politician who's motivated by faith in God,"" he said.Trump is doing well among evangelicals generally, and may well win the category in most of the states on Super Tuesday. But the sentiment at the Lakewood youth service is a larger warning for the party, in 2016 and beyond.An afternoon service for Latinos, held in both Spanish and English and attended by several thousand people, offered up even more for the GOP to worry about. Evangelical Christian Latinos, many of whom are converts from Catholicism, are a growing and increasingly important constituency in realms of both faith and politics.They are the tip of the spear of what was, once upon a time, the Bush family’s successful effort to reach out for Latino votes. In his second-term races for both governor of Texas and president of the U.S., George W. Bush won over 40 percent of that vote.To judge by some of the comments after the Latino service, if the election were held today, Trump would get zero.“If Donald Trump is the nominee, then Hillary Clinton will be president and none of the people here today will vote for him,” said Hilda Flores, a Republican who owns a wedding venue business. “I am a Republican, but the idea that he is going to try to deport 11 million people -- wrong! Wrong!""""I’m not for Ted Cruz either, for that reason,"" she went on. ""I’m going with Marco Rubio. At least he has tried to do something to make a deal on that.”Patrick Campbell, a white man who was attending the service with his Latina wife, agreed as he hurried out the door with his kids.“Donald Trump?"" he said. ""Forget it!”In 2012, Romney won only 27 percent of the Latino vote. He lost badly among millennials as well.Trump -- who's unpopular with Hispanic voters and under-30 voters nationwide -- will have to do a YUGE amount of repenting if he hopes even to approach Romney's performance among the youth and Latinos of Lakewood, judging from the Sunday before Super Tuesday.Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

3,POLITICS,Rubio And Cruz Release Partial Tax Returns,Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rubio-cruz-tax-returns_us_56d23ab9e4b03260bf771a37,Pressure is mounting on Donald Trump to do the same.,2016-02-28,Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) joined Sen. Tex Cruz (R-Texas) Saturday in releasing the top two pages of several year's worth of tax returns.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d24b371e00002200702f13.jpeg?cache=fo5IW0MrB6&ops=crop_36_90_1367_1227%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Saturday released the first two pages of their tax returns for the last several years, with Rubio releasing joint returns from 2010 through 2014 and Cruz releasing joint returns from 2011 through 2014.Both men have been calling on Republican front-runner Donald Trump to disclose his own tax documents, with Saturday's release timed to amplify pressure on Trump ahead of Super Tuesday.""Donald Trump owes it to the American people to be fully vetted, and that includes releasing his tax returns so the voters can see the full financial picture,"" Cruz said after he released his returns late Saturday night.Trump claims he can't release his returns because he's being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS, however, has clarified that an audit does not prevent a taxpayer from making returns public.Rubio's returns, while incomplete, revealed that he and his wife, Jeanette Rubio, earned a combined total of $2.3 million in income from 2010-2014. Much of that came from the royalties from two books Rubio has written.Rubio's yearly income for the five-year period ranged from a low of $183,826 in 2010 to a high of $938,963 in 2012. His tax rate ranged from 9.4 percent in 2010 to 27.4 percent in 2012. In 2014, Rubio earned a little over $190,000 in salary as a United States senator.Rubio has released partial returns before. During his 2010 Senate run, he published the first two pages of a decade's worth of returns. None of Rubio's tax releases include details about his itemized deductions or his investment losses and gains. Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told reporters the campaign ""won't rule out providing more information in the future."" The returns were released Saturday, he said, ""to put pressure on Trump and the other candidates to release theirs.""As for Cruz's returns, they show that in 2014, he and his wife, Goldman Sachs executive Heidi Cruz, made more than $1.2 million. From 2010 to 2014, the couple reported more than $7 million in adjusted gross income, and the pair paid an effective tax rate of between 28 and 32 percent.During his 2012 campaign for Senate, Cruz released his full tax returns from 2006 to 2010. On Saturday, he only released the top pages for 2011 through 2014.Heidi Cruz took a leave of absence from Goldman Sachs in early 2015, but before that she was a well-compensated executive. It's unclear from the Cruz's forms what portion of the family's income came from which spouse, but the annual salary for a U.S. senator is about $190,000.GOP candidates and establishment leaders are scrambling to attack Trump in the lead up to the next round of primaries. Until he decides to release his own figures, they'll likely continue to hammer the billionaire over what might be hidden in his income tax returns."
4,POLITICS,Polls Show Hillary Clinton And Donald Trump Ahead In Super Tuesday States,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/polls-super-tuesday-clinton-trump_us_56d2f1cae4b03260bf7724fd,Just two days left until the big day.,2016-02-28,Polls show Hillary Clinton leading in three Super Tuesday states. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d2f2a61500007f000b0d98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton holds a massive lead over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) heading into Super Tuesday -- the day the greatest number of states hold primary elections -- according to a set of three new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls of Georgia, Tennessee and Texas.On the Republican side, Donald Trump is making a strong showing in Georgia and Tennessee while Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) leads in his home state.The polls, released Sunday morning, show Clinton with 64 percent of the vote among likely primary voters in Georgia, while Sanders has just 30 percent. In Tennessee, Clinton holds 60 percent of the vote to Sanders' 34 percent, a 26-point lead. She leads by 21 points in Texas, with 59 percent to Sanders' 38 percent.HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates all publicly available polls, shows Clinton winning handily by similar margins in Georgia and Texas. Not enough polls have been conducted in Tennessee to form an aggregate projection. In the Republican race, Trump leads by 7 points among likely Georgia Republican primary voters with 30 percent of the vote. Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) trail closely behind with 23 percent each. In Tennessee, Trump is ahead by 18 points -- 40 percent to Cruz's 22 percent -- and Rubio trails with 19 percent.Cruz seems to have a home state advantage in Texas, holding 39 percent of the vote; Trump is in second place with 26 percent, and Rubio follows with 16 percent. Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) hold single-digit support in all three states. HuffPost Pollster shows similar leads for Trump in Georgia and Cruz in Texas. Not enough recent polling has been conducted in Tennessee to draw any projection. Super Tuesday is set for March 1. Eleven states will take to the polls or caucus for both parties: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. Republicans will also have contests in Alaska and Wyoming, and Democrats will caucus in American Samoa. A total of 661 delegates will be awarded on Super Tuesday in the Republican primary, and 880 in the Democratic primary. Various rules in each state determine how Republican delegates are assigned. Democrats assign delegates proportionally in each state. Still, even after Super Tuesday, the primary race has a ways to go for both parties before a nominee is decided. NBC/WSJ/Marist surveyed 543 likely GOP primary voters and 461 likely Democratic voters in Georgia from Feb. 18-23. In Tennessee, 665 likely GOP primary voters and 405 likely Democratic primary voters were surveyed Feb. 22-25. In Texas, 537 likely GOP primary voters and 381 likely Democratic primary voters were surveyed Feb.18-23."

Donald Trump is unfit to be President. He is a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears. Trump would take America on a dangerous journey,"" Whitman said in a statement obtained by NBC's ""Meet The Press.""""Christie knows all that and indicated as much many times publicly,"" she added. ""The Governor is mistaken if he believes he can now count on my support, and I call on Christie's donors and supporters to reject the Governor and Donald Trump outright. I believe they will. For some of us, principle and country still matter.""Whitman's sharp statement adds to the pile of angry rebukes of Christie from members of the GOP establishment after his stunning endorsement of Trump just days before the critical Super Tuesday primary contests on March 1.South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for president, also expressed her surprise on Sunday.""Chris is a dear friend, but none of us know why he did this,"" Haley said on ABC's ""This Week.""Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Meg Whitman as the former CEO of Hewlett Packard."
6,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Wins A Resounding Victory In South Carolina,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-south-carolina_us_56d220bfe4b0871f60eba9e3,"Her opponent, Bernie Sanders, had struggled to pick up enough support among black voters in the primary.",2016-02-28,"Audience members applaud Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a campaign event in Kingstree, South Carolina, on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_37_4560_2935%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Hillary Clinton won the Palmetto State’s Democratic presidential contest on Saturday, defeating Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) thanks to the strong support of African-American voters, who comprised over 60 percent of the primary electorate in the state.With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton led Sanders 73.5 percent to 26 percent. Her huge victory was especially sweet since she had suffered a brutal defeat to then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois in the Democratic primary here eight years ago. Multiple networks immediately called the race for Clinton when the polls closed at 7 p.m. ""Together, we can break down all the barriers holding our families and our country back,"" Clinton said at her victory party in Columbia. ""We can build ladders of opportunity and empowerment so every single American can live up to his or her God-given potential. Then, and only then, can America live up to it's potential, too."" Clinton, who is heading to Tennessee and Arkansas, said her campaign ""goes national"" Sunday. ""We are going to compete for every vote in every state,"" she said. ""We are not taking anything, and we're not taking anyone, for granted.""Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking Democrat in South Carolina, warmed up the crowd before Clinton spoke by saying that South Carolina's voters ""have started Hillary Clinton on the way to the White House."" ""After hearing and comparing, the Democratic voters of South Carolina have rendered a significant verdict,"" Clyburn said.After Sanders nearly tied Clinton in Iowa, won a blowout victory in New Hampshire and performed well with Latinos in Nevada, some had speculated that he could narrow the gap in South Carolina, where Clinton has consistently led by double digits in polls. But that prospect never came to fruition, and as the primary neared, Sanders’ own staff began to admit that he would lose.“I wouldn't focus on the margin because it’s not going to be that close,"" Sanders pollster Ben Tulchin told The State earlier this week. ""If we had three more months, we could close the gap more."" It was a much more somber message than the one the candidate had been projecting a month ago, when he said he thought he could win the state.Expectations aside, Sanders’ campaign had more paid staff in South Carolina than it had in Iowa and spent nearly $1 million on ads here. But in the week leading up to the primary, Sanders triangulated by racing between states holding primaries and caucuses next month -- Minnesota, Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio -- rather than getting as much face time with voters here as possible. He was on a plane to Minnesota Saturday night when the result was called.""In politics, on a given night, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,"" Sanders told reporters when he touched down in Rochester. ""Tonight we lost."" In contrast, the Clintons -- Hillary, Chelsea and Bill -- criss-crossed the state, appearing at over 20 town halls, forums and rallies over the last four days to run up the score as much as possible. Clinton’s team had learned from her 2008 loss and sent her and her allies to the state to connect with voters and make the case that she’s the best candidate to build upon the progress President Barack Obama has made.Obama is extremely popular among African-Americans, and black voters here told HuffPost that they resented that Sanders said a Democrat challenging the president in his 2012 re-election would be a good thing for the party and for democracy.In 2008, black voters made up 55 percent of primary voters in the state, and of those voters, nearly 80 percent supported Barack Obama. This year, exit polls showed black voters made up 61 percent of the electorate in the state. Clinton won 84 percent of the African-American vote, meaning she won this demographic by a larger margin than Obama did in 2008. Clinton also won 54 percent of white voters, which should be heartening to her campaign since Sanders has beaten her among white voters in previous contests. But Sanders continued to demonstrate his popularity among younger voters, beating Clinton among voters aged 17-29. To advance the link between Clinton and Obama, Clinton’s campaign and a super PAC backing her called Priorities USA both ran ads here featuring Eric Holder, Obama’s former attorney general. It was an obvious irony that Clinton’s strategy here was to frequently connect herself to the politician who stymied her presidential chances in 2008.Sandra Edwards, a 53-year-old woman from Charleston who canvassed for Clinton in 2008, said that election’s “final result went with Obama because people thought it was time for a black president. Now it’s time for a woman president.” Clinton frequently emphasized racial justice in her campaign, calling for gun safety reforms after the shooting at a church in Charleston killed nine last June. She called for police to wear body cameras after a white officer shot and killed the unarmed black man Walter Scott in North Charleston in April. Earlier this week, she held a forum with mothers of unarmed young African-Americans who have been killed in high-profile acts of brutality, including Trayvon Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, and Sandra Bland's mother, Geneva Reed-Veal. At a packed town hall Thursday night in North Charleston, Clinton said it was important to be “honest about systemic racism” and said she wanted her white supporters to “start thinking about what life is like for others.” Her message of empathy was a huge hit with the predominantly black audience.“It’s important for white people to understand our experience is not the same experience as African-Americans or the experience of Latinos,” she said. “It’s time we did much more than we have to put ourselves in the minds and the hearts and the shoes of people like Trayvon Martin or like his mother, Sybrina Fulton. … How would you feel if every time your son went out with his friends, you worried that he might not come home? How would you feel if when you went to apply for a mortgage and had the same financial ability as someone else, you were turned down?” Clinton also got local in her comments before South Carolina voters, mentioning that their governor, Republican Nikki Haley, had rejected expanding Medicaid with funds from the Affordable Care Act and that the state’s Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the rural schools were underfunded.Sanders’ campaign also stepped up its emphasis on racial justice leading up to the primary. His supporters frequently mentioned Clinton’s backing of the 1994 crime bill and welfare reform as reasons for why they were supporting the senator. Erica Garner, Eric Garner’s daughter, testified to Sanders’ commitment to reform in a powerful ad that ran here. And the filmmaker Spike Lee taped a radio ad saying that Sanders isn’t “on the take,” an implicit critique of Clinton and the donations and speaking fees she's received from Wall Street. At a rally for Sanders Friday where the senator was introduced by the rapper Killer Mike and Ohio Democrat Nina Turner, supporters told HuffPost that his advocacy for universal health care, criminal justice reform and free college resonated with them. But they said they thought he would lose to Clinton because of Bill Clinton’s popularity among African-Americans. The race between the two candidates now turns to “Super Tuesday” on March 1, where the candidates will compete in more than a dozen primaries and caucuses. Sanders’ campaign hopes that he can beat Clinton in Massachusetts, Vermont, Minnesota and Colorado and come close to her in delegate-rich states like Texas. He has to, if he is to have any shot at the nomination. Clinton’s win in South Carolina is sure to give her more confidence heading into March, where she hopes to build up an insurmountable lead among delegates. "

Multiple networks immediately called the race for Clinton when the polls closed at 7 p.m. ""Together, we can break down all the barriers holding our families and our country back,"" Clinton said at her victory party in Columbia. ""We can build ladders of opportunity and empowerment so every single American can live up to his or her God-given potential. Then, and only then, can America live up to it's potential, too."" Clinton, who is heading to Tennessee and Arkansas, said her campaign ""goes national"" Sunday. ""We are going to compete for every vote in every state,"" she said. ""We are not taking anything, and we're not taking anyone, for granted.""Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking Democrat in South Carolina, warmed up the crowd before Clinton spoke by saying that South Carolina's voters ""have started Hillary Clinton on the way to the White House."" ""After hearing and comparing, the Democratic voters of South Carolina have rendered a significant verdict,"" Clyburn said.After Sanders nearly tied Clinton in Iowa, won a blowout victory in New Hampshire and performed well with Latinos in Nevada, some had speculated that he could narrow the gap in South Carolina, where Clinton has consistently led by double digits in polls. But that prospect never came to fruition, and as the primary neared, Sanders’ own staff began to admit that he would lose.“I wouldn't focus on the margin because it’s not going to be that close,"" Sanders pollster Ben Tulchin told The State earlier this week. ""If we had three more months, we could close the gap more."" It was a much more somber message than the one the candidate had been projecting a month ago, when he said he thought he could win the state.Expectations aside, Sanders’ campaign had more paid staff in South Carolina than it had in Iowa and spent nearly $1 million on ads here. But in the week leading up to the primary, Sanders triangulated by racing between states holding primaries and caucuses next month -- Minnesota, Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio -- rather than getting as much face time with voters here as possible. He was on a plane to Minnesota Saturday night when the result was called.""In politics, on a given night, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,"" Sanders told reporters when he touched down in Rochester. ""Tonight we lost."" In contrast, the Clintons -- Hillary, Chelsea and Bill -- criss-crossed the state, appearing at over 20 town halls, forums and rallies over the last four days to run up the score as much as possible. Clinton’s team had learned from her 2008 loss and sent her and her allies to the state to connect with voters and make the case that she’s the best candidate to build upon the progress President Barack Obama has made.Obama is extremely popular among African-Americans, and black voters here told HuffPost that they resented that Sanders said a Democrat challenging the president in his 2012 re-election would be a good thing for the party and for democracy.In 2008, black voters made up 55 percent of primary voters in the state, and of those voters, nearly 80 percent supported Barack Obama. This year, exit polls showed black voters made up 61 percent of the electorate in the state. Clinton won 84 percent of the African-American vote, meaning she won this demographic by a larger margin than Obama did in 2008. Clinton also won 54 percent of white voters, which should be heartening to her campaign since Sanders has beaten her among white voters in previous contests. But Sanders continued to demonstrate his popularity among younger voters, beating Clinton among voters aged 17-29. To advance the link between Clinton and Obama, Clinton’s campaign and a super PAC backing her called Priorities USA both ran ads here featuring Eric Holder, Obama’s former attorney general. It was an obvious irony that Clinton’s strategy here was to frequently connect herself to the politician who stymied her presidential chances in 2008.Sandra Edwards, a 53-year-old woman from Charleston who canvassed for Clinton in 2008, said that election’s “final result went with Obama because people thought it was time for a black president. Now it’s time for a woman president.” Clinton frequently emphasized racial justice in her campaign, calling for gun safety reforms after the shooting at a church in Charleston killed nine last June. She called for police to wear body cameras after a white officer shot and killed the unarmed black man Walter Scott in North Charleston in April. Earlier this week, she held a forum with mothers of unarmed young African-Americans who have been killed in high-profile acts of brutality, including Trayvon Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, and Sandra Bland's mother, Geneva Reed-Veal. At a packed town hall Thursday night in North Charleston, Clinton said it was important to be “honest about systemic racism” and said she wanted her white supporters to “start thinking about what life is like for others.” Her message of empathy was a huge hit with the predominantly black audience.“It’s important for white people to understand our experience is not the same experience as African-Americans or the experience of Latinos,” she said. “It’s time we did much more than we have to put ourselves in the minds and the hearts and the shoes of people like Trayvon Martin or like his mother, Sybrina Fulton. … How would you feel if every time your son went out with his friends, you worried that he might not come home? How would you feel if when you went to apply for a mortgage and had the same financial ability as someone else, you were turned down?” Clinton also got local in her comments before South Carolina voters, mentioning that their governor, Republican Nikki Haley, had rejected expanding Medicaid with funds from the Affordable Care Act and that the state’s Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the rural schools were underfunded.Sanders’ campaign also stepped up its emphasis on racial justice leading up to the primary. His supporters frequently mentioned Clinton’s backing of the 1994 crime bill and welfare reform as reasons for why they were supporting the senator. Erica Garner, Eric Garner’s daughter, testified to Sanders’ commitment to reform in a powerful ad that ran here. And the filmmaker Spike Lee taped a radio ad saying that Sanders isn’t “on the take,” an implicit critique of Clinton and the donations and speaking fees she's received from Wall Street. At a rally for Sanders Friday where the senator was introduced by the rapper Killer Mike and Ohio Democrat Nina Turner, supporters told HuffPost that his advocacy for universal health care, criminal justice reform and free college resonated with them. But they said they thought he would lose to Clinton because of Bill Clinton’s popularity among African-Americans. The race between the two candidates now turns to “Super Tuesday” on March 1, where the candidates will compete in more than a dozen primaries and caucuses. Sanders’ campaign hopes that he can beat Clinton in Massachusetts, Vermont, Minnesota and Colorado and come close to her in delegate-rich states like Texas. He has to, if he is to have any shot at the nomination. Clinton’s win in South Carolina is sure to give her more confidence heading into March, where she hopes to build up an insurmountable lead among delegates. "

The Harrisburg Bureau of Police says he carried out a relationship with a 15-year-old girl in 2014. He was seven years her senior at the time.""What can I say. I did abuse the system, yes. Yes, I did. I did use this identity and it's the law,"" he told a WHTM reporter in a phone interview from Dauphin County Prison.Samarin was unmasked Tuesday after authorities said he used the fake name ""Asher Potts"" to enroll at Harris High School as a freshman in 2012.While taking classes, he was heralded as a star student who achieved a 4.16 grade-point average and was nominated as homecoming king last fall, PennLive reported.Police say he also was enrolled in the school's ROTC program, was a member of the National Honors Society and took classes at Harrisburg University. In 2014, he was publicly recognized by state Rep. Patty Kim (D-Dauphin County), who tweeted a photo of them together using the hashtags ""going places"" and ""proud.""Prior to his 2012 enrollment, police say Samarin had not only graduated high school in the Ukraine but also completed two years of college.Asked by WHTM what he'd like to say to the people who believed and supported him, Samarin expressed hope for himself and said he was an ""American."" ""I want to tell them that I have a dream. I still have a dream. I love the United States. It's a land of opportunity for all of us immigrants and this land provided me with opportunities, with limitless friends,"" he said. He also told the reporter he preferred to be addressed by his moniker Asher Potts.""I am American. I am considering myself American now,"" he continued. ""American, it's not your place of birth, but it's something that goes on inside of your soul. It's the way you feel. It's liberties and justice, that you earn. And I love it.""Police say Samarin legally arrived in the U.S. in 2012 on a three-month work and study visa, and was employed by a local company. When the visa expired he applied for and was granted a tourist visa. That expired in March 2013. By then he was already two semesters in at the high school after enrolling with falsified documents.""One of the documents was a social security card that was ultimately approved after multiple attempts at several Social Security Administration offices,"" police said in a release.Samarin was initially arrested on charges of identity theft, theft by unlawful taking and tampering with public records.He was hit with the sexual assault and corruption of minors charges while behind bars. Police said additional charges are expected."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) didn't sugarcoat things Sunday morning when discussing the results of Saturday night's Democratic primary in South Carolina, where Hillary Clinton defeated him by a margin of 73 percent to 26 percent.""We got decimated,"" he said on ABC's This Week. ""We got decimated. The only positive thing for us is we won ... the 29 years of age and younger vote. And that was good. But we got killed.""Clinton even did better with African-American voters in the state than Barack Obama did in 2008.Sanders attempted to spin his loss during an appearance on CBS’ ""Face The Nation"" by pointing to the Clintons' history in the state.“Remember, this is their fourth campaign in South Carolina,” he said. “Two for Bill Clinton, two for Hillary Clinton. They had it well organized, they did well and I congratulate them. We came into that state at something like 7 percent, 8 percent in the polls.""Sanders went on to say that his campaign is ""confident in the future."" But the confidence may be misplaced. The states voting this week on Super Tuesday largely favor Clinton as well, especially if Sanders can’t make up ground in the next several days with the minority voters that make up a large portion of the Democratic electorate.Sanders on Sunday predicted wins in Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma and Vermont, as well as a strong showing in Massachusetts. And then, he said, it would be on to big states like California and New York.“So I think we do have a path to victory,” he told ""Face The Nation"" host John Dickerson. “Now I won't tell you that we didn't get beaten and beaten very badly yesterday in South Carolina.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is not winning the Republican primary right now. And as a number of states get ready to vote in a slate of elections this Tuesday, it’s dawned on him that he needs to start actually throwing some punches at the front-runner, Donald Trump, if he wants to chip away at his lead.In recent days, the Florida Republican has said that Trump is pulling one of the greatest (if not the greatest) political con jobs on voters this country has ever seen. Which raises the question: were the people who voted for Trump in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada duped? Where they naïfs? On ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Rubio was asked that question. And he responded that the supporters who elevated Trump to wins in those states weren’t dumb -- they were just swindled. And it was the media who was at fault, since it loved both the good ratings Trump brings and the inevitable Hillary Clinton general election win when he ends up the nominee.“[T]he media coverage for Donald Trump has almost been cheerleading over the last couple weeks and I’m convinced because many in the press want him to be nominee,” said Rubio. “One, I think they think it’s going to be good for ratings and two because they know they have a lot of material to work with. If Donald Trump were to ever become the nominee, immediately the hounds of hell will descend on him, tear him apart, everything he's ever done from not releasing his taxes to all of his failed business dealings. And Hillary Clinton’s going to have a clear shot to the Oval Office.”Rubio went on.“I think there are many out there who are rooting for that outcome so that he’s the nominee, and you can see it in the coverage he’s gotten,” he said. “I mean, this guy has not offered a single serious policy proposal, which is important if you want to be president of the United States…. so I think there’s kind of a weird bias here in the media rooting for Donald Trump because they know he's the easiest Republican to beat.”Trump does rely heavily on the media to help his candidacy. And he does benefit in ways that others don’t -- either through wall-to-wall coverage of his rallies or the freedom to call into television interviews. For a while, moreover, he wasn’t being directly challenged over some obvious and clear inaccuracies – though that has noticeably begun to change.But the idea that he’s been able to coast to this point because the media is rooting for him is silly. See the editorial note below.Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist,birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Bernie Sanders, with the pair sparring in recent debates over everything from Clinton's ties to Wall Street to Sanders' previous criticism of President Barack Obama.An observer of the debates between each candidate's more fervent online supporters could be forgiven for thinking that the party electorate is similarly divided. Charged arguments have left Clinton's backers denouncing their rivals as ""Bernie bros,"" a characterization that Sanders' supporters emphatically reject.But Twitter and Reddit, as either scientific studies or a bit of common sense can attest to, are far from representative of the broader electorate. And such animosity hasn't taken much hold among the majority of party voters, who like both their candidates and are already largely willing to rally behind either in a general election.Exit polls in South Carolina, like those in previous states, show that a strong majority of voters would be satisfied to see either candidate as the nominee. And a national HuffPost/YouGov poll, conducted before the primary, shows Democrats generally happy to accept either candidate.According to that survey, 77 percent of Democratic primary voters nationwide would be at least satisfied with a Clinton nomination, and 63 percent would be at least satisfied with Sanders as the nominee. Fewer than a fifth would be angry about either outcome.While Clinton, who continues to hold a small lead in national polls, has the edge, even those who'd be less than happy with a Sanders victory would support him over a Republican rival.Democratic primary voters overwhelmingly say they'll stay within party lines come November, with 76 percent saying they'd vote for Clinton and 77 percent that they'd vote for Sanders. The remainder are more likely to say they're undecided or not planning to vote than that they'd turn out for a Republican. In fact, the percentage who'll eventually end up voting along partisan lines is likely even higher. In 2008, after a protracted battle that left some die-hard Clinton supporters vowing that they'd never support Obama, about 89 percent of Democrats ended up voting for their party's nominee over John McCain.And most Democratic primary voters have nothing but good feelings for their fellow party members, regardless of whom they're backing. Seventy-three percent take a positive view of Clinton supporters, while 69 percent feel warmly toward Sanders' supporters.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 22-24 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

""Quit talking nonsense, Donald!” the woman shouted. “Tell us your actual plan! What are you gonna do?""The woman wasn’t a protester, she explained to the unimpressed people standing in her vicinity. Given Trump’s position as the prohibitive favorite to win the Republican nomination, she genuinely was curious to hear about what he planned to do as president.But with Trump still engaged in his usual shtick, the woman soon gave up and joined the ranks of the hundreds of people who were already streaming out of the Fort Worth Convention Center.The woman’s frustration with Trump reflected the tack that he has stuck to ever since entering the race in June: making a lot of promises without explaining in any detail how he intends to keep them. Trump says that he will defeat the Islamic State. How? He’d “bomb the shit out of them.”Trump vows that he’ll repeal Obamacare. And with what will he replace it?

The Democratic Party had a terrible one.Clinton trounced Sen. Bernie Sanders by nearly 3-to-1 in the South Carolina primary, winning every single county in the state. The thumping followed a convincing Clinton victory in the Nevada caucuses less than a week earlier, and sets the stage for a strong showing for Clinton on Super Tuesday, when 11 states are in play. For the Democratic Party establishment, these wins are being interpreted as a sign that the universe is back in order, after a 74-year-old democratic socialist from Vermont had seemingly knocked everything out of orbit. Party leaders long ago picked Clinton as their standard-bearer for 2016 and worked to clear the field of potential primary challengers. When Sanders began closing on Clinton in national polls and clobbered her in New Hampshire, the establishment bet was starting to look shaky. Had they lost touch with the core concerns of the party's base? After South Carolina, Sanders' chances to secure an upset nomination are dwindling.Exit polling showed that Clinton won every demographic tracked except voters under 30. Even here, she was far more competitive with Sanders than in prior contests, losing just 54 percent to 46 percent. She even won a higher share of the black vote than Barack Obama did in 2008.But Democratic Party elites shouldn't be high-fiving each other. They should be very, very worried. In primary after primary this cycle, Democratic voters just aren't showing up. Only 367,491 people cast a ballot for either Clinton or Sanders on Saturday. That's down 16 percent from the 436,219 people who came out in 2008 for Clinton and Obama. Factor in the 93,522 people who voted for John Edwards back in the day, and you can see the scope of the problem. Democrats in 2016 are only getting about two-thirds of the primary votes that they received eight years ago.Republican turnout in the South Carolina primary, by contrast, was up more than 70 percent from 2008.South Carolina's turnout numbers are not an anomaly. They're consistent with other primaries to date. Republicans are psyched. Democrats are demoralized. Presidential elections increasingly hinge on each party's ability to turn out the faithful. There simply are not many truly independent voters who cast their ballots for different parties in different cycles. A big chunk of voters who identify as independents do so not because they cherish a moderate middle ground between two parties, but because they see their own party as insufficiently committed to its ideological principles. In this era, lousy primary turnout spells big trouble for the general election.The poor Democratic turnout figures are not an indictment of Clinton alone. Maybe the DNC's decision to bury the party's debates on weekends and holidays helped Republicans generate more early enthusiasm with primetime coverage. And part of Sanders' pitch, of course, is his insistence that progressive energy will bring out high numbers of enthusiastic voters that an old party insider just can't compete with. It's a good pitch. But so far, it isn't happening.It's always hard to motivate voters for four more years of the same old thing after getting eight years of it -- especially when many of those years were mired in an awful recession, followed by a weak economic recovery. Opposition parties typically have a better hand after eight years. That's why 12-year runs in the presidency by a single party don't happen very often.If Republicans nominate Donald Trump for president -- and barring a cataclysm or a coup, they will -- there will be plenty of energized Democrats who turn out in the general election for no other reason than to cast a ballot against a billionaire who has predicated his campaign on raw bigotry.That will help even the energy some. But the flip side of the coin is that lots of angry white people will show up to vote for Trump. We know because they're already doing so in the primaries. And a lot of Republican partisans who prefer other candidates still care more about turning the page on the Obama era than they do about Trump's flirtations with fascism (and even, at times, liberal critiques of GOP orthodoxy).Trump's overtly racist campaign makes it hard to see how he wins Western swing states like Nevada or New Mexico that have high numbers of Latino voters. But his economic pitch to the white working class holds obvious appeal in traditional Democratic strongholds in the upper Midwest -- communities that have been ravaged by the past three decades of U.S. economic policy. Even if Trump lost every other swing state in the country, turning the Rust Belt red would be enough for him to win the Electoral College.That's a difficult maneuver. But it's time to start worrying about President Trump.Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So, That Happened."" Subscribe here or listen to the latest episode below: "

Biden's other son, Hunter, also survived that accident.During Biden's speech Saturday at the California Democrats State Convention in San Jose, a protester started yelling that Beau had died due to cell phone radiation. The crowd booed the heckler. Biden tried to calm the crowd down.""It's OK, it's all right,"" he said. ""It's OK, it's OK.

Above, children walk through the rebel-held town of Douma on Saturday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d2399a1e0000950070ee79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. This week, we speak with Syria expert Joshua Landis about the dilemmas that the Nusra Front poses to the truce deal in Syria.An uneasy calm settled over Syria Saturday when fighting stopped in large parts of the country as part of a temporary truce brokered by the U.S. and Russia.After five years of war in Syria, it was the first truce that held for more than a few hours. While scattered clashes and airstrikes continued in parts of the country and the Islamic State militant group launched an offensive on a Kurdish-held border town, Russia said it was suspending all airstrikes for the day. Some Syrians took advantage of the quiet to clear the debris from their war-battered towns and cities.However, the deal for a two-week cessation of hostilities does not include groups deemed to be terrorist organizations by the international community, including the Islamic State and Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, Nusra Front. Russia says it will resume bombing those groups after Saturday.The exclusion of Nusra Front from the agreement poses some particular difficulties. The group, which split bitterly from the Islamic State in 2014, fights alongside other Syrian rebel groups and jointly controls parts of the Syrian province of Idlib. Unlike the Islamic State, the group is widely dispersed over rebel-held territory. The U.S. and Russia said they would jointly pinpoint Nusra Front positions to target, but a Russian map released Saturday raised concerns that the northern provinces of Idlib and Aleppo would be excluded from the truce.The Nusra Front leader has condemned the cessation of hostilities agreement and urged rebel groups to instead escalate their fight against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.The WorldPost spoke to Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma and editor of the blog Syria Comment, about the dilemmas that Nusra Front poses for the truce deal -- and for peace in Syria.Why was Nusra Front excluded from the cessation of hostilities in Syria?Because both Russia and the U.S. agree that Nusra Front is a terrorist organization and should be destroyed.Can the deal still work if Nusra Front is not part of it?It’s a big problem, if you want to stop killing people. There’s still going to be a lot of bombing in Syria. Nusra Front fighters are present in many parts of rebel-held territory, especially in rebel central, which is Idlib province. Nusra Front is also a dominant rebel group in the major rebel umbrella organization called Jaish al-Fatah. So it’s difficult to distinguish between Nusra Front and other groups in many parts of Syria.But there are some parts of Syria where there isn’t a very heavy Nusra Front presence. If you look at this as a limited ceasefire and only in certain areas, it could be useful. For example, there isn’t much Nusra Front presence in the areas north of Aleppo that have been very badly bombed by Russia and which Turkey does not want to be captured by the Kurds or the Syrian army. So the truce could apply to that area, and frustrate the Kurds capturing it. Even if the truce was just to cover that one single area of Syria, that would be of immense benefit to the U.S., Turkey and the rebels.Could this limited ceasefire be a first step towards a future peace deal?I doubt it. Russia and Syria are committed to reconquering all of Syria. So far Putin doesn’t seem to show any signs of losing interest in Syria or getting stuck in a quagmire. I think this momentary pause is first and foremost to demonstrate that America is doing something. There’s tremendous pressure on the United States. This is both for humanitarian reasons -- as Russia bombs hospitals and a tide of humanity pushes up against the Turkish border -- and because [President Barack] Obama needs to do something to smooth the feathers of our traditional allies, like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who are apoplectic and accuse the U.S. of abandoning them.I think Obama told the Russians: Give us a ceasefire, even if it’s a limited one for short duration, because I’ve got to take something home. And this is what the Russians have come up with. But obviously Assad is very interested in pressing his advantage right now -- he has the rebels on the run. The Syrian regime’s objective is to shut off the rebels' supply chain to the Turkish border, and the more truces they sign, the longer they have to linger and wait. Some Syrian opposition groups wanted Nusra Front to be included, saying they’re concerned Russia will use its exclusion as a pretext to keep bombing other rebels.The rebels are going to say that. And I’m sure that’s a genuine worry. But the real worry is that Nusra is their best ally. Nusra is the strongest fighting force the rebels have. If they let Nusra be defeated by Russia, they’re all going to collapse. And if they accept a truce that Nusra is excluded from, Nusra Front will accuse them of selling them down the river. I also imagine that some fighters would defect to Nusra. It’s going to rip apart their loyalties. This is precisely why Syria and Russia want the truce. They know the big rebel militias that are aligned with Nusra can’t actually uphold it. The moment that the U.S. declared Nusra a terrorist organization three years ago and started bombing them, everybody knew this day was going to come. The Nusra Front are all over the battlefield and are part of one aspect of the Syrian rebellion, a Sunni Islamic rebellion. Now Assad is trying to kill these international terrorists, and Assad becomes the good guy.How did Nusra Front become such a prominent force in the Syrian conflict?There’s two factors. They share an ideology of Islamic struggle with other groups. They are the extreme end, but there is an overlap. In the same way that Marco Rubio may think Ted Cruz is too extreme, but they all share an ideology that the Democrats are evil, the Islamists all share an ideology that secular dictatorship and nationalism is bad and you need an Islamic world. But most of all, Nusra Front knows how to fight. Al Qaeda central sent a lot of fighters to them. They’ve got expertise, they’ve got money, they’ve got backing and they’re good at what they do. That’s why they began to win battles. Most of the other militias were new at this. Al Qaeda was bringing 20 years of real in-the-trenches knowhow. Other rebels recognized this immediately and wanted to be on the same team. Has the strategy of cooperating or even integrating with other opposition groups helped Nusra Front stay so prominent?It has, totally. ISIS and Nusra share a similar ideology but have very different strategies. ISIS declared a caliphate and said everyone has to bow down and kiss our toes and genuflect, and Syrians don’t like to do that. The CIA estimated last year there were 1,500 militias in Syria. They don’t want to be under one leader. That was the whole point of getting rid of Assad -- they want to be free. By contrast, Nusra Front said you don’t have to have a caliphate today, that it could be delayed to beat Assad. They’re willing to work within this framework of a thousand militias. So even though they’re aggressive and they sometimes rub the other militias the wrong way, they didn’t destroy or demand obedience from other militias. Other rebels know that if they want to walk away, they can walk away. Whereas with ISIS, if you walk away they chop your head off.But while Nusra’s strategy is a strength in certain circumstances, it’s a weakness in circumstances like this, because other groups may sign a ceasefire agreement and throw you under the bus.  How connected is Nusra Front to Al Qaeda leadership?I don’t know for sure, but I’m certain that Al Qaeda central needs to save Nusra Front. In this big battle between ISIS and Nusra Front, if Nusra Front gets destroyed because all the Syrian rebels sign a truce and let the Syrian army kill off Nusra Front, it will be devastating for the Al Qaeda franchise. What is life like under Nusra Front rule?It varies quite a bit depending on their strength in the area. Where they are stronger, they are much more high-handed. A lot of Syrians don’t like it at all. You don’t want someone telling your wife what to wear or stopping you from smoking cigarettes. There’s no human rights there. It’s a wretched, miserable situation, and you don’t know which way is up. Do you put Nusra on the terrorist list or not on the terrorist list; include them in a deal or not include them? America wants Nusra Front militants killed -- they’re propagating real hatred of the West and extolling the virtues of bin Laden and it’s dangerous. On the other hand, you can’t abandon this whole world of oppressed people in Syria to be slaughtered by Assad’s government. That’s not going to bring justice, and it will only create more jihadism.This interview was conducted on Feb. 24 and has been edited and condensed for clarity."

This is both for humanitarian reasons -- as Russia bombs hospitals and a tide of humanity pushes up against the Turkish border -- and because [President Barack] Obama needs to do something to smooth the feathers of our traditional allies, like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who are apoplectic and accuse the U.S. of abandoning them.I think Obama told the Russians: Give us a ceasefire, even if it’s a limited one for short duration, because I’ve got to take something home. And this is what the Russians have come up with. But obviously Assad is very interested in pressing his advantage right now -- he has the rebels on the run. The Syrian regime’s objective is to shut off the rebels' supply chain to the Turkish border, and the more truces they sign, the longer they have to linger and wait. Some Syrian opposition groups wanted Nusra Front to be included, saying they’re concerned Russia will use its exclusion as a pretext to keep bombing other rebels.The rebels are going to say that. And I’m sure that’s a genuine worry. But the real worry is that Nusra is their best ally. Nusra is the strongest fighting force the rebels have. If they let Nusra be defeated by Russia, they’re all going to collapse. And if they accept a truce that Nusra is excluded from, Nusra Front will accuse them of selling them down the river. I also imagine that some fighters would defect to Nusra. It’s going to rip apart their loyalties. This is precisely why Syria and Russia want the truce. They know the big rebel militias that are aligned with Nusra can’t actually uphold it. The moment that the U.S. declared Nusra a terrorist organization three years ago and started bombing them, everybody knew this day was going to come. The Nusra Front are all over the battlefield and are part of one aspect of the Syrian rebellion, a Sunni Islamic rebellion. Now Assad is trying to kill these international terrorists, and Assad becomes the good guy.How did Nusra Front become such a prominent force in the Syrian conflict?There’s two factors. They share an ideology of Islamic struggle with other groups. They are the extreme end, but there is an overlap. In the same way that Marco Rubio may think Ted Cruz is too extreme, but they all share an ideology that the Democrats are evil, the Islamists all share an ideology that secular dictatorship and nationalism is bad and you need an Islamic world. But most of all, Nusra Front knows how to fight. Al Qaeda central sent a lot of fighters to them. They’ve got expertise, they’ve got money, they’ve got backing and they’re good at what they do. That’s why they began to win battles. Most of the other militias were new at this. Al Qaeda was bringing 20 years of real in-the-trenches knowhow. Other rebels recognized this immediately and wanted to be on the same team. Has the strategy of cooperating or even integrating with other opposition groups helped Nusra Front stay so prominent?It has, totally. ISIS and Nusra share a similar ideology but have very different strategies. ISIS declared a caliphate and said everyone has to bow down and kiss our toes and genuflect, and Syrians don’t like to do that. The CIA estimated last year there were 1,500 militias in Syria. They don’t want to be under one leader. That was the whole point of getting rid of Assad -- they want to be free. By contrast, Nusra Front said you don’t have to have a caliphate today, that it could be delayed to beat Assad. They’re willing to work within this framework of a thousand militias. So even though they’re aggressive and they sometimes rub the other militias the wrong way, they didn’t destroy or demand obedience from other militias. Other rebels know that if they want to walk away, they can walk away. Whereas with ISIS, if you walk away they chop your head off.But while Nusra’s strategy is a strength in certain circumstances, it’s a weakness in circumstances like this, because other groups may sign a ceasefire agreement and throw you under the bus.  How connected is Nusra Front to Al Qaeda leadership?I don’t know for sure, but I’m certain that Al Qaeda central needs to save Nusra Front. In this big battle between ISIS and Nusra Front, if Nusra Front gets destroyed because all the Syrian rebels sign a truce and let the Syrian army kill off Nusra Front, it will be devastating for the Al Qaeda franchise. What is life like under Nusra Front rule?It varies quite a bit depending on their strength in the area. Where they are stronger, they are much more high-handed. A lot of Syrians don’t like it at all. You don’t want someone telling your wife what to wear or stopping you from smoking cigarettes. There’s no human rights there. It’s a wretched, miserable situation, and you don’t know which way is up. Do you put Nusra on the terrorist list or not on the terrorist list; include them in a deal or not include them? America wants Nusra Front militants killed -- they’re propagating real hatred of the West and extolling the virtues of bin Laden and it’s dangerous. On the other hand, you can’t abandon this whole world of oppressed people in Syria to be slaughtered by Assad’s government. That’s not going to bring justice, and it will only create more jihadism.This interview was conducted on Feb. 24 and has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Many carried boxes of documents to the podium at the National Assembly, some wearing sneakers.Earlier this month, President Park Geun-hye's office called for parliament to pass the stalled security bill, part of tough action taken by her government amid heightened tension with North Korea following its test launch of a long-range rocket this month and its fourth nuclear test last month.The opposition wants the removal of a provision in the bill that would give South Korea's intelligence agency authority to monitor private communications.Lawmakers from the conservative ruling Saenuri party, which controls 157 of the assembly's 293 seats, have expressed dismay that the speech-making is causing other bills to be delayed ahead of parliamentary elections due in April.Opposition lawmaker Jung Chung-rae spoke for 11 hours and 39 minutes on Saturday, the longest speech of the filibuster thus far.Some lawmakers have come to tears during their speeches, while one of them sang and another read aloud from George Orwell's ""1984,"" according to a South Korean newspaper.(Additional reporting by Jee Heun Kahng; Editing by Tony Munroe and Paul Tait)"

26,CRIME,‘Execution-Style’ Killing Of 3 Young Men Sparks Outrage (UPDATE),Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/execution-style-murder-young-muslim-men_us_56d35a51e4b0871f60ebc77a,"Two of the young men were Muslim, but local police do not believe it was a hate crime.",2016-02-28,"Fort Wayne police chief Garry Hamilton speaks at the funeral of three young men killed in Fort Wayne, Indiana.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d35f5b1500002a000b0db9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Police have yet to identify a motive in the gruesome shooting death of three young men of African descent in a Fort Wayne, Indiana, house.Mohamedtaha Omar, 23, Adam Mekki, 20, and Muhannad Tairab, 17, were killed “execution-style” on Wednesday, according to Fort Wayne’s public safety director Rusty York.Two of the young men were Muslim and one was Christian, according to Michael Joyner, a spokesman for the Fort Wayne Police Department. Joyner did not know which of the slain young men was Christian.The police department's investigation ""ruled out"" the possibility that the killings were a hate crime, Joyner said Monday, but it has not yet identified a suspect or a motive.Joyner noted that one of the men who lives in the home where the young men were killed is ""known to law enforcement and known to associate with gangs."" The man was not present in the house when the three young men were found.Hamzah Sharif, the imam of the Islamic Center of Fort Wayne, did not mention a possible motive in a Facebook message about the young men’s funeral. He instead lauded the presence of the town’s other communities of faith at the service.“All of [the] Fort Wayne community showed unity and solidarity against violence and stood together to pray for the three young men along with their families,” Sharif wrote.Although one of the young men was Christian, some in the Muslim American community expressed a deep sense of loss after initial reports that all three victims were Muslim.Ahmed Abdelmageed, director of experiential education at Manchester University’s college of pharmacy in Fort Wayne, acknowledged that the deaths were an especially painful blow for Muslims, but warned against assuming it was a hate crime. “‘Execution Style’ and the word ‘Muslim’ have certainly been forever ingrained in the minds of American Muslims and they trigger painful images of 3 beautiful souls lost for simply being Muslim,” Abdelmageed wrote on Facebook. “I caution however that the reason does not appear to be related to them being Muslim.”But the incident comes amid a wave of anti-Muslim incidents in the wake of the November terror attack in Paris. Some people, many of them Muslim, took to Twitter to question law enforcement’s contention that the crime was unrelated to the faith of two of the victims, and to call for an investigation of the killings as a hate crime.Others expressed anger at what they say is the national news media’s inattention to the incident.That Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) has yet to publicly comment on the young men’s deaths is likely to fuel these suspicions. ThinkProgress noted that, by contrast, Pence has publicly offered condolences for a number of other violent incidents outside of the state in recent years, such as the August shooting of a TV correspondent and cameraman in Roanoke, Virginia.MPower Change, a Muslim online activism group, has started a petition calling for the Fort Wayne Police Department to ""conduct a full and comprehensive investigation"" of the killings. The group is promoting awareness of the killings on social media with #OurThreeBoys. UPDATE: Feb. 29 -- Original reports on Sunday identified all three men as Muslim. Details have been updated throughout the article in light of the latest information from authorities in Fort Wayne."

King said that there has been a 40 percent decline in summer jobs for youth over the past 12 years. “First jobs have the incredible power to set young people on a path to productivity and success, and away from bad outcomes in their lives,” King said.For POTUS, that first summer job, although ""brutal on the wrists,"" proved crucial.""While I may have lost my taste for ice cream after one too many free scoops, I’ll never forget that job -- or the people who gave me that opportunity -- and how they helped me get to where I am today,"" Obama wrote in his LinkedIn post.

32,BUSINESS,10 Ways to Spot a Truly Exceptional Employee,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-ways-to-spot-a-truly-e_b_9116134.html,Dealing with difficult people is frustrating and exhausting for most. Exceptional employees control their interactions with toxic people by keeping their feelings in check.,2016-02-28,Businessman sitting on top of ladder wearing sunglasses looking out,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb33c71260000360082110e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A recent international study surveyed more than 500 business leaders and asked them what sets great employees apart. The researchers wanted to know why some people are more successful than others at work, and the answers were surprising; leaders chose ""personality"" as the leading reason.Notably, 78% of leaders said personality sets great employees apart, more than cultural fit (53%) and even an employee's skills (39%).""We should take care not to make the intellect our God; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality."" - Albert Einstein The problem is, when leaders say ""personality"" they don't understand what they're referring to. Personality consists of a stable set of preferences and tendencies through which we approach the world. Being introverted or extroverted is an example of an important personality trait.Personality traits form at an early age and are fixed by early adulthood. Many important things about you change over the course of your lifetime, but your personality isn't one of them.Personality is distinct from intellect (or IQ). The two don't occur together in any meaningful way. Personality is also distinct from emotional intelligence (or EQ), and this is where the study, and most leaders for that matter, have misinterpreted the term.The qualities that leaders in the study called personality were actually emotional intelligence skills. And unlike your personality, which is set in stone, you can change and improve your EQ.Exceptional employees don't possess God-given personality traits; they rely on simple, everyday EQ skills that anyone can incorporate into their repertoire.Leaders don't need to go searching for these skills either (though it doesn't hurt when you find them); their duty is to help everyone on their team harness these skills to become exceptional.Just consider some of the EQ skills that leaders and managers commonly mislabel as personality characteristics. These are the skills that set exceptional employees apart.They're willing to delay gratification. One thing an exceptional employee never says is, ""That's not in my job description."" Exceptional employees work outside the boundaries of job descriptions. They're neither intimidated nor entitled; instead of expecting recognition or compensation to come first, they forge ahead in their work, confident that they'll be rewarded later but unconcerned if they're not.They can tolerate conflict. While exceptional employees don't seek conflict, they don't run away from it either. They're able to maintain their composure while presenting their positions calmly and logically. They're able to withstand personal attacks in pursuit of the greater goal and never use that tactic themselves.They focus. Student pilots are often told, ""When things start going wrong, don't forget to fly the plane."" Plane crashes have resulted from pilots concentrating so hard on identifying the problem that they flew the plane into the ground. Eastern Airlines Flight 401 is just one example: The flight crew was so concerned about the landing gear being down that they didn't realize they were losing altitude until it was too late, despite alarms going off in the cockpit. Exceptional employees understand the principle of ""Just fly the plane."" They don't get distracted by cranky customers, interoffice squabbles, or switch to a different brand of coffee. They can differentiate between real problems and background noise; therefore, they stay focused on what matters.They're judiciously courageous. Exceptional employees are willing to speak up when others are not, whether it's to ask a difficult (or ""embarrassingly"" simple) question or to challenge an executive decision. However, that's balanced with common sense and timing. They think before they speak and wisely choose the best time and place to do so.They're in control of their egos. Exceptional employees have egos. While that's part of what drives them, they never give their egos more weight than what is deserved. They're willing to admit when they're wrong and willing to do things someone else's way, whether it's because the other way is better or it's important to maintain team harmony.They're never satisfied. Exceptional employees have unparalleled convictions that things can always be better -- and they're right. No one is ever done growing, and there is no such thing as ""good enough"" when it comes to personal improvement. No matter how well things are going, exceptional employees are driven to improve, without forgetting to give themselves a healthy pat on the back.  They recognize when things are broken and fix them. Whether it's a sticky desk drawer or an inefficient, wasteful process affecting the cash flow of the entire department, exceptional employees don't walk past problems. ""Oh, it's been that way forever,"" simply isn't in their vocabulary. They see problems as issues to be fixed immediately; it's that simple.They're accountable. If you're a manager trying to decipher a bungled report, ""It's not my fault"" is the most irritating phrase in the English language. Exceptional employees are accountable. They own their work, their decisions, and all of their results--good or bad. They bring their mistakes to management's attention rather than hoping no one will find out. They understand that managers aren't out to assign blame; they're out to get things done.They're marketable. ""Marketable"" can mean many things. Inside the organization, it means ""likable."" Exceptional employees are well liked by co-workers. They have integrity and leadership skills (even if they're not in an official leadership position) that people respond to. Externally, it means they can be trusted to represent the brand well. Managers know they can send these employees out to meet with clients and prospects without worrying about what they'll say or do.They neutralize toxic people. Dealing with difficult people is frustrating and exhausting for most. Exceptional employees control their interactions with toxic people by keeping their feelings in check. When they need to confront a toxic person, they approach the situation rationally. They identify their own emotions and don't allow anger or frustration to fuel the chaos. They also consider the difficult person's standpoint and are able to find solutions and common ground. Even when things completely derail, emotionally intelligent people are able to take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting him or her bring them down.Bringing It All TogetherTake notice of what's not mentioned: coding skills, years of experience, business degrees, etc. These things matter, but they won't make you exceptional.What other qualities make people exceptional?

And then, unfortunately, we talked about politics.",2016-02-28,2016-02-27-1456606680-971997-7474207144_8b7eb1fe3b_m.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-02-27-1456606680-971997-7474207144_8b7eb1fe3b_m-thumb.jpg,"Last week, at an Applebee's in Georgia, I met a married couple. They were older, with grown children. They were friendly and engaging people from Ohio. We talked about beer. We talked about veterans. And then, unfortunately, we talked about politics.Have you ever watched a video of a train derailing? Where the slightest swaying quickly becomes an epic topple to end all topples? Where you can see the passengers belatedly realizing their mistake in not taking the short commuter flight? That's the best way to explain what happened when they asked the simple question - -to which I honestly answered -- ""Who are you supporting in this presidential election?""""I don't know for sure,"" I said, ""but probably Hillary."" I might have well have suggested that I was going to sacrifice their unborn grandchildren at the altar of liberal progress.Over the course of the following half-hour, they moved progressively closer to me at the bar, first sitting, then standing over me, as they discovered the full extent of my blasphemy. You see, they were Ted Cruz supporters from Ohio. They didn't support Ohio Governor John Kasich's presidential campaign because he was ""pretty much a Democrat.""Once we established my liberal, god-hating bona fides, they fired the opening salvo. ""How can you support Hillary, with everything we know about Benghazi? Have you seen them movie?""Look, I strongly dislike all Michael Bay movies. I told them I dislike Michael Bay movies. But I can't blame Michael Bay's artistic choices for my decision to avoid 13 Hours. Our first rupture was created there, when I pointed out that the Benghazi controversy around Hillary Clinton was not backed by fact, as established by multiple Republican and independent investigations.From that point on, it was a downhill plummet through Judeo-Christian values, black welfare queens, abolishing the IRS, and Bernie Sanders' hatred of American values. I was fighting to stay afloat in a sea of made-up numbers and alarmist anecdotes about sharia law and Muslim beheadings in the U.S.I didn't relish the conversation. In fact, I was disappointed that we had irretrievably lost the initial camaraderie that arose around a mutual interest in drinking good beer and investing in veterans causes. In the first 30 minutes, everything I said about veterans was taken at face value; they regarded me as an expert based on my bona fides. Yet, once politics intruded, I became a sleeper agent for those who are destroying America. They told me that it was surprising that I could care about veterans (my day job) while supporting Democrats. It was painful to follow their train of thought; which judged my value through the lens of FOX News and Judicial Watch. But it did help me better comprehend how starkly divided we have become over politics and culture in 2016.On their way out the door, now regarding me like a sinner who failed to repent, they said were sad that their millennial son was inheriting this world.President Obama may have been wrong when he said in 2004 that ""there is not a liberal America and a conservative America."" I don't recognize the America they describe. Like Warren Buffett, I don't see a nation in decline.It is clear that no matter how jaded we have become about our candidates, they stand for starkly different world views. This election is shaping up -- even more than 2000 or 2008 -- to be an affair fought and decided in opposing echo chambers, with the two party's candidates tossing insults at each other from afar to activate their bases while chasing after a limited number of truly independent, undecided voters. This is not healthy. But it is our reality.My conversation with two polite, upper-middle class Ohioans on a sailing trip was derailed due to our inability to amicably debate politics without resorting to character assassination. I never sought to ""win"" the argument or belittle their points. But if we can't maintain common ground at a small town restaurant, where the locals pride themselves on their hospitality, can we expect to find common ground in battleground states across America?At the end of the night, after my political adversaries had stalked out, I thanked the bartender who had a front row seat to our conversation cum debate, while noting that I hadn't expected to be ambushed with a political dispute. ""Baby,"" she called me for the fifth time, ""no one comes looking for politics at Applebee's."" "

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has built a bigger operation in South Carolina than in any other state thus far in the Democratic presidential primary as he tries to close in on front-runner Hillary Clinton in the last contest ahead of Super Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d1d25e1500002a000b0d4c.jpeg?ops=crop_0_191_4000_2477%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA -- On the eve of South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke in a mostly empty gymnasium at the historically black Claflin University in Orangeburg. It was an unusual sight for those accustomed to massive rallies for Sanders packed with thousands upon thousands of screaming supporters.Sanders, as candidates tend to do, spun the appearance as an auditorium-half-full, rather than half-empty, moment. “When we first came here, we knew very few people,” he said. “But in the last nine months, we have come a very long way, and that’s because of your support.”Nearly every poll in the contest between Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton here has had Clinton up by 20 points or more. One major reason for Clinton’s persistent leads here is her popularity among African-American voters, who make up more than half of the Democratic primary electorate.But conversations with young black Sanders supporters after his rally at Claflin revealed a generational divide, with many attributing Clinton’s support here to her husband, Bill Clinton, and his popularity among their parents and grandparents given the economic gains they made when he was president in the 1990s.“I know particularly for my family, Bill Clinton kinda has the glaze of the glory days, everyone talks about the surplus,” Eddie Massey, a 23-year-old student from Orangeburg and self-identified “C-span addict” told HuffPost. “My parents’ generation, they’re stuck on that.” Sanders’ young supporters find his message of eradicating income inequality, making college free and enacting criminal justice reforms more appealing. But they can’t convince their parents otherwise.“I told my mom I was coming to the rally and she was like, ‘Oh so you’re still on the Bernie train?’ She speaks highly of Bill, there was a lot of economic growth with him,” said Britney White, a 25-year-old graduate student at Claflin. White’s friend Shiann Bradley echoed the sentiment.“All of our parents grew up with President Clinton,” Bradley said. “We don’t really know [the Clintons] the way they know them, we just know what we hear on social media.” Clinton herself mentioned how the economy fared under her husband soon after she began speaking to hundreds at a large rally in Columbia at which Bill introduced her Friday evening. “It won’t surprise you to hear me say that I know the last two Democratic presidents pretty well,” she joked, to laughter and applause. “I want you to remember and remind your Republican friends they both inherited economic problems from their Republican predecessors. At the end of Bill’s eight years we had 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody, not just those at the top … The median family income went up 17 percent and the median African-American income went up 33 percent. Everybody rose together.”Sanders’ campaign this week sent the senator to other states that hold contests Tuesday and later in March, like Oklahoma, Minnesota, Illinois, Ohio and Texas. It's an apparent admission that his chances to come close to Clinton here are slim and that he needs to rack up delegates elsewhere to have a shot at the nomination. “He’s kinda given up on South Carolina, it was like New Hampshire for him,” said Jerry Emanuel, a substitute teacher in Columbia who was working a volunteer phone bank for Clinton at the campaign’s office. New Hampshire, where Sanders won by more than 22 points, was largely seen as a given for the candidate.“She has got to win big today,” Emanuel added. “I don’t mean 20 percent. I mean big. She’s got to make a statement that she’s made a mark, she’s here to stay and she’s on her way.” Sanders’ trips elsewhere, however, don’t mean that his campaign hasn’t tried to do well in the state: As Bloomberg reported, Sanders has roughly 200 paid staffers working in South Carolina -- more than in Iowa, where he nearly tied Clinton on Feb. 1 -- and has spent about $1 million on ads here in the past month. The Huffington Post struggled to find a Sanders supporter who would say, just for the heck of it, that they thought he would beat Clinton. Nathaniel Bell, a 37-year-old assistant professor at the University of South Carolina’s nursing school, said at a coffee shop in Columbia that while he was optimistic, “this is historically Clinton territory because of Bill.” Bill Clinton, as it happens, had dropped by that very coffee house minutes before with the city’s mayor to get some decaf and work the room. “I vote for who I want to win, not for whom I think is going to win,” Bell said.
