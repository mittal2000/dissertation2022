The party, the coroner's report found a few months later, had alienated women and minorities and came off as plutocratic. But with another presidential election now quickly approaching, the zombie appears to be rising from the table, as the party’s discourse has not exactly been focused on the priorities that the 2013 report identified. Over the past few weeks, the GOP presidential campaign has been fixated on comments Donald Trump made, in which the candidate called Mexican immigrants coming illegally across the border ""rapists."" On Capitol Hill, Republicans have turned their attention towards defunding Planned Parenthood after controversial, edited videos emerged on the group's practices of donating fetal tissue. Elsewhere, GOP lawmakers are pushing to roll back Wall Street reform and, for the fourth straight national election, repeal Obamacare.And that’s all to say nothing of the current Topic A in the national Republican discourse: whether it was appropriate for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) to invoke Hitler and the Holocaust in characterizing President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran.National Republican officials and strategists, hopeful that the summer of 2015 would help set the stage for the retaking of the White House for the first time in eight years, are now fretting about squandered opportunities.“Comments from many different candidates -- some more serious than others -- have become a distraction in this race, and that’s a problem,” said Brian Donahue, a currently unaligned GOP strategist who has been in talks with several campaigns. “These are not serious issues. These are flippant comments, particularly those expressed by Mike Huckabee, and they don’t reflect what the majority of the party establishment or the grassroots thinks or is concerned about.”The prevailing sentiment within the party, at this early juncture at least, is that the silly season of the campaign will turn. History shows that the Donald Trumps of campaigns fade in time (though previous incarnations haven’t had 10-figure personal bank accounts from which to draw).""I think the public views Trump as Trump views himself -- someone who is not really of a political party and is all about himself. There is no reason to believe that when most of the Republican candidates are disagreeing with him that he is currently hurting the party,"" said Stu Stevens, Mitt Romney's top campaign strategist from 2012. ""The terrain of an election isn't really set by what is on the news as much as it is set by how people are living.

The highly personalized attack was met with rebukes from Cruz's colleagues, who've long regarded him as a showboat and still value the concept of Senate decorum.

John Kasich, who has recently begun to make some noise in the polls in New Hampshire, is another GOP White House contender hoping to benefit from projecting an image of calm competence.“The party will ultimately be defined by the nominee, not by the equivalent of a trashy summer beach novel now,” said John Weaver, Kasich’s top strategist. “When the nominee is John Kasich, his pro-growth record and inclusive agenda will force the Democrats on the defensive.”While Bush and Kasich bide their time -- watching as other candidates literally light things on fire in order to earn their own slice of mid-summer attention -- silver linings have emerged.On the Democratic side, the rhetoric may not be as outlandish and the overarching strategy not so clearly fractured, but the numbers aren't particularly great.

2,POLITICS,Claire McCaskill Shotgunned A Beer When Todd Akin Won The GOP Primary,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/claire-mccaskill-shotgunned-beer_us_55b93614e4b0074ba5a75b04,"""We laughed until we cried,"" she writes.",2015-07-29,<p>Todd Akin won the Republican nomination in 2012 and Claire McCaskill drank a beer as a result</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Some politicians celebrate major career milestones with reflection, others with words of thanks to staff. Some stay humble in victory; others take to the podium to gloat. And some just chug booze.Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) shotgunned a beer the night then-Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) won the 2012 Republican Senate primary and became her general election opponent, she reveals in her new book “Plenty Ladylike.” Unfortunately, she didn't reveal what the beer was, making it all but impossible to truly judge her drinking capacity. McCaskill had plenty to celebrate that night. Akin, a tea party Republican, was the most inherently flawed candidate among the three GOP candidates running for the nomination, and her campaign had spent $1.7 million to prop him up. That effort, which the McCaskill campaign dubbed “A Cup of Tea,” involved running ads touting just how conservative Akin was, in the hopes of swaying Republican voters.It was a high-risk strategy. If Akin didn’t win the nomination, McCaskill would look foolish for wasting her campaign resources.But it was high-reward, too. Akin ended up being just as flawed as McCaskill’s aides predicted, eventually producing the most boneheaded line of the campaign cycle: that the bodies of women who had experienced ""legitimate"" rapes had a way of shutting down any resulting pregnancies.The other reward was alcohol. After launching “A Cup of Tea,” McCaskill promised her two daughters that she’d shotgun a beer if Akin won the primary. In her book, she details the night Akin won the contest:After hugging my husband and calling my son in St. Louis, it was time for me to keep my promise. My daughters had to show me how to shotgun a beer. You punch a hole in the side of a beer can while holding it horizontally. Then you invert the can upside down over your mouth and pull the aluminum tab. Beer gushes into your mouth and you have to swallow quickly to avoid a big mess. I did it. And we laughed until we cried.UPDATE  : 5:00 p.m. -- Brian Walsh, who was a staffer at the National Senatorial Republican Committee during the 2012 cycle, revealed that he consumed booze on the night of Akin's win as well.

11,POLITICS,Democrats Want To Extend Civil Rights Protections To Unpaid Interns,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unpaid-interns-discrimination-civil-rights_us_55b7af7ce4b0224d8833fef5,Most unpaid interns aren't covered by discrimination laws because they aren't considered employees.,2015-07-28,<p>Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) introduced a trio of bills to protect unpaid interns from workplace discrimination.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7b2f11700002600565ba1.jpeg?cache=8UnHX3ttYD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Unpaid interns in most states aren't covered by the same workplace discrimination and harassment laws as employees, but some House Democrats are trying to change that.Three lawmakers introduced a trio of bills Tuesday aimed at closing loopholes that exclude unpaid interns from protection. The Civil Rights Act doesn't currently cover such workers because they aren't compensated and therefore aren't technically employees. Workers must receive ""significant remuneration"" in order to have recourse through federal law.""There should be no legal grey area when we are talking about preventing sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace,"" Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.) said in a statement. The bills, which Cummings introduced along with Reps. Bobby Scott (Va.) and Grace Meng (N.Y.), would prohibit unpaid interns who work for federal or state governments or private-sector companies from being discriminated against on the basis or race, sex or religion. Under the Democratic proposal, an intern who faced such discrimination could sue in court based on the Civil Rights Act.Young unpaid interns may be less likely to complain about discrimination or harassment than more seasoned workers since they're trying to get their start up the career ladder. Meng said in a statement that the proposal was intended to protect people who are just entering the workforce and may be particularly vulnerable.""A negative experience like this can be devastating to young interns as they start their careers, and these types of incidents can have terrible impacts on their futures,"" she said. The odds of the three bills passing are slim. Democratic proposals don't have much of a track record in the GOP-controlled House, and Republicans have been reluctant to pursue any legislation that could lead to more lawsuits against businesses. Nonetheless, when asked about the legislation, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce said, ""We are always open to discussing ideas intended to guard against discrimination and harassment in the workplace.""A handful of states have moved to protect unpaid interns where federal law currently does not, as The Huffington Post has previously reported. So far, a half-dozen states and the District of Columbia have passed laws protecting unpaid workers from sexual harassment or discrimination. The most recent was Connecticut, where last month Gov. Dan Malloy (D) signed legislation that was approved unanimously by the state's House of Representatives."

Lincoln Chafee compared himself to former President Theodore Roosevelt (above).</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, whose candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination hasn’t yet found a pulse in public opinion polls, hasn't lost hope.In a briefing with reporters hosted by The Christian Science Monitor, he compared himself favorably to two former presidents, suggesting that, in the long run, his campaign will take flight. The first was Jimmy Carter, whom, Chafee noted, was also considered a dark horse candidate during his presidential run in 1976.The other, perhaps less obvious, analogy Chafee drew was with Teddy Roosevelt.“Well, Theodore Roosevelt certainly, I think I compare favorably to him saying speak softly and carry a big stick,” he said, when asked which president he admired most besides the ever-popular Abraham Lincoln. “Sometimes people say, 'Lincoln [Chafee]’s so quiet,' but you see the courage that I exhibit when the pressure is on. And I think you can say that about me.”Chafee is certainly a soft speaker. After the breakfast was done, he joked about his penchant for pregnant pauses which, over the preceding hour, had led to numerous journalists interrupting his answers with follow-up questions under the assumption he was done speaking.As for carrying a big stick, his foreign policy seems more pacifist than that. He praised President Barack Obama's deal on Iran's nuclear weapons program and his re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. But he also called the president's drone program the biggest mistake of the administration. In addition to Roosevelt, there were other, more modern, presidents Chafee said he holds in esteem.“I do admire courage in politics and the guts and backbone,” he said. “And [George] H.W. Bush going back on 'read my lips' to address the real issue of deficits and then Bill Clinton putting in his deficit reduction plan, that took guts. He knew the political sacrifice that was going to come. Both of them knew that. So I’ll be bipartisan on that."""
14,POLITICS,Another Argument From Obamacare Critics Is Starting To Crumble,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-critics-argument_us_55b79f5be4b0a13f9d1a36af,Study suggests the law has improved access to care.,2015-07-28,<p>Researchers used Gallup data from a survey that asks people about their health care access and how healthy they think they are.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7a6971d00002f00142f54.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Millions of additional people now have health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act.But does that mean Americans actually have better access to health care?Some intriguing, if tentative, new research suggests the answer is yes. It’s one more reason to think Obamacare is not the fiasco that critics claim it to be.In a new paper for the Journal of the American Medical Association, a group of scholars attempt to produce a before-and-after picture of the health care law’s implementation. To do so, they draw on three years of data from Gallup’s ongoing “well-being index” survey, which asks respondents about health insurance status as well as their access to care.Among the survey’s regular questions: Are you having an “easy” time paying for medication? Do you have a regular primary care physician? Do you feel like you’re in good health? That last question is important because, according to some previously published research, how people answer is a pretty good predictor of mortality. People who say they are in good health usually are.The picture from the raw data is a little muddled. The number of people without health insurance has dropped precipitously, from 20.3 percent of working-aged adults before the Affordable Care Act’s coverage expansion took full effect to 14.5 percent at the beginning of 2015. And the percentage of respondents who say they “cannot afford care” fell from 20.4 percent to 17.8 percent during that same time period.On the other hand, the percentage who said they have no personal physician remained basically the same, and the percentage who said they were in “fair” or “poor” health actually increased a bit, from 18.3 percent to 18.8 percent.But the researchers didn’t simply pull numbers from the surveys. They adjusted the responses for variables like unemployment, in an attempt to isolate the effects of the health care law from other factors, such as the recovering economy. The researchers also looked specifically at the trends -- in other words, whether access to care was getting worse before the health care law’s implementation, and, if so, whether that deterioration stopped.That lens produced a more consistent story. Every trend had been getting worse -- and then, with the health law’s full implementation, either stopped getting worse or started getting better. Lead author Benjamin Sommers, a Harvard economist and physician who used to work at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the difference amounted to 11 million more adults saying they can afford their health care and 6.8 million reporting they were in good health. (Sommers made these comments on a conference call that HHS, which sponsored and reviewed the study, held on Monday -- although the paper itself does not represent the agency’s official view.)The shifts were most pronounced among racial and ethnic minorities, groups that were the most likely to have been uninsured before the law took effect, and larger in states that have expanded access to their Medicaid programs (which provides insurance to people with incomes below or just above the poverty line) than in states that have not. Taking all of that into account, the paper’s authors determined: “The ACA’s first 2 open enrollment periods were associated with significantly improved trends in self-reported coverage, access to primary care and medications, affordability, and health.”That conclusion may confound some of the health care law’s most determined detractors, including Republican officials who say that the law has actually reduced access to care. These critics point to the high out-of-pocket costs people frequently face, even if they have insurance, and the difficulty finding physicians who can provide timely appointments. And like all academic studies, this one will be subject to scrutiny that, over time, could call its findings into question. As the authors themselves make very clear, their efforts to account for the effects of the economy could be off the mark. People who feel healthier may not actually be healthier. To the extent the improvement since late 2013 is real, it could stop -- or even reverse.But the article had to pass JAMA’s scholarly peer review process, lending it credibility, and the findings are consistent with past research -- including major studies from Oregon and Massachusetts in which people ended up more financially secure after getting health insurance through government initiatives similar in structure to the Affordable Care Act. (The evidence on whether people actually end up in better health is a lot murkier, and more contested, than the evidence on whether people have an easier time paying their medical bills.)The JAMA article obviously doesn’t address many other arguments that the Affordable Care Act’s critics make -- about its possible impact on innovation, for example, or failure to make coverage even more affordable for the middle class. And that's to say nothing of the more philosophical objections to the law, whether to the expanded role of government or the regulations that drive up premiums for many young and healthy people.But a common refrain among the law’s opponents is that the insurance people are getting, through either government or private sector, doesn’t really help people. This study makes that argument less believable.Also on HuffPost:"
15,POLITICS,One Email That Proves Campaign Finance Laws Are A Joke,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carly-fiorina-super-pac_us_55b79747e4b0074ba5a6233c,"Super PACs and candidates can't coordinate, except when they obviously do.",2015-07-28,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Carly for America, the super PAC backing former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina’s presidential campaign, invited supporters to join a conference call on Thursday with -- Carly Fiorina. Think this required any ""coordination"" between the supposedly independent super PAC and the candidate?The email invite from the super PAC informs supporters that ""Special Guest Republican Candidate for President Carly Fiorina"" will be joining them. At the same time, it contains the necessary legal notice that Carly for America ""is an independent expenditure committee and not authorized or coordinated with any federal candidate or candidate's committee.""The problem is that federal campaign coordination laws ban only certain types of cooperation and association between candidates and supposedly independent groups. A candidate cannot have input on the content -- text, video, imagery or other materials -- or the conduct -- strategy, timing or payment -- of a communication. This leaves a lot of other activity open to the interpretation of the Federal Election Commission, which rarely enforces the anti-coordination rules in particular and at this moment is deeply divided on how to enforce its regulations overall.FEC gridlock is just one of many reasons why the 2016 presidential campaign has seen a complete meltdown of the notion that candidates don't work with the super PACs and nonprofits supporting them.Few have gone as far as Fiorina, whose campaign is essentially being run out of the super PAC. The joint conference call with supporters featuring Fiorina but hosted by the super PAC is just one example of this. Staffers at Carly for America -- which has raised $3.4 million so far and will report its donors on Friday -- have taken on such core campaign functions as managing rapid response to press questions, rolling out endorsements of the candidate, funding grassroots organizing and organizing advance work for Fiorina’s appearances.This is all a far cry from 2012 when Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney distanced himself from attack ads made by Restore Our Future, the super PAC supporting his bid, by stating that he would go “to the big house” if he so much as urged the super PAC to stop running the ads.This year, people are talking to each other. Just as Fiorina will speak on her super PAC-organized conference call, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry delivered his anti-Donald Trump speech at a July 22 event hosted by his super PAC, Opportunity and Freedom PAC.Also on HuffPost:"
