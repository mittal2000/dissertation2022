The New York Times began their review of the second installment in the ""Star Trek"" movie series with the words, ""Now this is more like it."" Since it became such an established classic, you may be surprised to learn of one, then untested, but now famous director who almost helmed the movie.""One of the directors I know that I was keen on was a young man who actually came in at Paramount's suggestion,"" ""Wrath of Khan"" producer Robert S. Sallin says in a new video Paramount provided exclusively to HuffPost.That ""young man"" was Ron Howard, who went on to become one of Hollywood's most popular directors, helming movies such as ""Apollo 13,"" ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Da Vinci Code.""At the time, according to Sallin, many directors passed on the project because they didn't want to do a ""Star Trek"" movie or a sequel. But Howard was excited about the prospect of taking on the project. ""He loved 'Star Trek by the way,"" says Sallin. ""And that counts for a lot.""In addition to Howard's fandom for the movie, his younger brother, Clint Howard, made acting appearances in the ""Star Trek"" television series dating back to the '60s. This could have been a match made in the starry heavens.Sallin even decided Howard was his top choice, but as the producer says in the video, bringing Howard on board didn't work out. The studio tapped another untested director at the time, Nicholas Meyer, who would end up directing later ""Star Trek"" projects, as well.From the clip, it is unclear who was responsible. ""Khan?!"" Probably not, but a suspect for sure.The exclusive clip is from a new series of interviews available with the Blu-ray debut of the director's cut for ""Wrath of Khan."""
1,POLITICS,"Paul Ryan Tries To Escape Trump With Anti-Poverty Plan, Can't",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-anti-poverty-trump_us_5756c69ae4b0b60682ded288,The anti-poverty plan was meant to separate House Republicans from Trump. Paul Ryan just connected the two.,2016-06-07,Paul Ryan will have to keep answering questions about Donald Trump for the foreseeable future.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57570d8f160000bc04f95933.jpeg?ops=crop_0_76_2099_2417%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Speaker Paul Ryan and a group of House Republicans came to a drug and alcohol rehab center in a low-income area of Washington on Tuesday to escape the shadow of Donald Trump, to talk about real issues that transcend politics, and to release an anti-poverty plan. Instead, Trump became the news.In the release of their first of six policy planks, the Republican ""Task Force on Poverty, Opportunity, and Upward Mobility"" issued a 35-page report Tuesday laying out a vision of public-private partnerships intended to lift people out of poverty.Much of the plan is just a reissuing of recycled Republican ideas, or, in the words of ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, ""an unspecific regurgitation of the same failed trickle-down policies that the GOP has been peddling for decades.""The key focus of the proposal seems to be expanded work requirements for welfare and other benefits, with a focus on requiring recipients to either be working or preparing to work if they're to get assistance.Republicans also want to consolidate a number of poverty programs, emphasize private retirement savings accounts like 401(k)s, and reduce improper payments -- the tried and true talking point of reducing ""waste, fraud and abuse.""""There are people on the front lines fighting poverty successfully,"" Ryan said Tuesday. ""And the problem we have had in government for too long is we think the way to fight poverty is to treat its symptoms. And when we treat the symptoms of poverty, we perpetuate poverty.""A key finding in the report is that current efforts to combat financial hardship have not worked. That's a point Democrats contest.“Speaker Ryan and Republicans continue to mislead and distort the truth by stating that the poverty rate has remained flat, despite spending trillions of dollars on social safety net programs,"" Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), one of the leading congressional advocates for the poor, said in a release. ""This claim is simply not true. The poverty rate has fallen substantially since we began the war on poverty, and as of 2014, we have cut the overall poverty rate by 40 percent, and the child poverty rate by 35 percent.""Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also called out Ryan and Republicans, saying that ""beneath the sugary rhetoric"" of the plan unveiled Tuesday, ""Republicans are advancing the same callous, trickle down policies they’ve been pushing for years.""“No matter what new language they are using, the vast majority of House Republicans’ legislation has consistently shown families in poverty nothing but indifference and contempt,"" Pelosi continued in a statement.There are plenty of items lawmakers theoretically should be able to agree on. The plan wants to better support at-risk youth, improve technical and higher education, and strengthen nutrition for students and working families.Anti-poverty groups applauded Ryan ""for giving poverty the attention it deserves,"" in the words of Bread for the World president Rev. David Beckmann.“We have disagreements with some of the proposals,"" Beckmann said. ""But we are pleased that the plan doesn’t propose to cut or block-grant anti-poverty programs, and we welcome the emphasis on making programs as effective as possible.”That's the conversation Ryan wanted.He's made a point with the release of this GOP agenda to try to offer serious policy proposals, trying to contrast House Republicans with the toxic rhetoric surrounding their party's presumptive presidential nominee.But he couldn't escape Trump.The first question Ryan was asked was about Trump's comments on Judge Gonzalo Curiel -- whether he thought it was racist for Trump to say Curiel should recuse himself from a Trump University case because of his Mexican heritage.Ryan was quick to disavow those sentiments, saying he regretted Trump had said those comments and wouldn't ""pretend to defend them.""“Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,” Ryan said, offering up perhaps the juiciest quote of his speakership thus far.And suddenly that was the news.Trump surrogate Jeffrey Lord began accusing Ryan of being the real racist. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another Trump surrogate of sorts, said Trump was ""not a racist"" -- a totally reassuring thing people have to say about Trump from time to time -- and said Ryan was ""entitled to his opinion.""Meanwhile, the speaker faced more questions about whether he had been too quick to endorse Trump, and whether he might rescind his support.Even as he called the comments ""unacceptable,"" Ryan said he was still voting for Trump because Republicans have more in common with their nominee than they do with Hillary Clinton.And in many ways, that was the quote Democrats were looking for, even more than the ""textbook definition of a racist comment"" soundbite.For a policy agenda that was partly meant to separate Republicans from Trump, Ryan had just evidenced his support for the GOP nominee by noting that Trump was more likely to sign GOP legislation than Clinton.""Do I believe that Hillary Clinton is going to be the answer to solving these problems?"" Ryan asked. ""I do not.""""I believe that we have more common ground on the policy issues of the day,"" Ryan said of Trump, ""and we have more likelihood of getting our policies enacted with him than we do with her.""The moment wasn't lost on Pelosi.""Donald Trump has exposed the true heart of House Republicans’ agenda of recklessness, obstruction and discrimination,"" Pelosi said in her statement. ""Republicans’ half-hearted rebrand of their special interest priorities will do nothing to distract from the radicalism of Republicans’ standard-bearer or House Republicans’ longstanding disdain for people in poverty.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "
2,POLITICS,What Comes Next For The Bernie Sanders Movement,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-movement-next-moves_us_575747e5e4b0a3d6fbd31932,Sanders supporters will gather in Chicago later this month to figure out how to move forward.,2016-06-07,How can Sanders supporters make sure the Democratic Party continues to Feel the Bern?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575749fb1200005b02895ac5.jpeg?ops=crop_0_53_3500_2053%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Even Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) stalwart supporters are admitting that yes, it looks like Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic presidential nominee, and it's time to figure out what happens next. Neil Sroka, spokesman for the pro-Sanders group Democracy for America, wouldn't go so far as to call Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee -- as the AP did Monday night --but he was willing to discuss what would happen ""if"" she is the nominee and what progressives would like to see.""The big question as we move into the general election is, if Secretary Clinton is the nominee, she will have won the nomination based on making a series of promises about her willingness to fight for a number of different populist progressive positions ... and it will be important to see whether or not that rhetoric was just something that happened during the primary or will continue during the general election,"" Sroka said Tuesday afternoon. The main issue for Sanders supporters now is what to do. There's general agreement that they want to see progressive policies continue to be a part of the discussion. That means making sure Clinton doesn't veer to the right in an attempt to win over moderate Republicans and trying to ensure the Democratic Party platform reflects the values of the Sanders movement. But specific actions are still scarce. The most concrete example of progress is that the Democratic National Committee recently agreed to give Sanders six spots on the 15-member Platform Committee, a move intended to help heal any wounds remaining from the primary fight.""The sooner that Platform Committee members publicly signal they will unify around a bold progressive agenda, the sooner Bernie Sanders and his supporters will know they have achieved the mission of helping to transform the future of America,"" the Progressive Change Campaign Committee said in a statement Monday night.A group of prominent Sanders supporters will be meeting in Chicago later this month to hammer out exactly what their next steps will be. Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner (D), Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and National Nurses United Executive Director RoseAnn DeMoro will all be there to discuss how to continue the Vermont senator's movement even after his candidacy is over. (Sanders is also an invited speaker.)""This campaign is about a mission of saying that there are big issues -- global warming, cash in politics, living wage jobs -- that we have to advance in a passionate and aggressive fashion,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Sanders' only backer in the Senate, told MSNBC on Monday. ""I think that the way that the campaigns carry on a discussion after Tuesday is about how you bring the party together and about how, in doing so, we position ourselves to aggressively take on those goals that have resonated so effectively in the grassroots.""A coming flashpoint could be whom Clinton decides to choose as her running mate. Progressives are keeping their fingers crossed for a kindred spirit, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) the beau ideal. Few people are really talking about Sanders as a vice presidential candidate, in part because there are more effective messengers out there who could satisfy the progressive base, better work with Clinton and champion the same policies Sanders talked about on the trail. And ultimately, Clinton is still the one at the top of the ticket. Sroka said that rather than obsessing over the vice presidential nominee, DFA will focus on ensuring that Clinton maintains a progressive message -- and will turn its attention to down-ballot races. Russ Feingold's Senate bid in Wisconsin is a marquee contest for progressives, along with Zephyr Teachout's campaign in New York's 19th congressional district. There's also Tim Canova in Florida's 23rd district, who is running a long-shot bid to unseat DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who has earned the ire of Sanders supporters for seeming to tip the scales in Clinton's favor.Sanders supporters also bristled at the media's rush to declare Clinton the winner on Monday night, before all the primary contests were even over. Six states voted Tuesday, and the District of Columbia's primary isn't until June 14. But The Associated Press said that based on its count of superdelegates, Clinton had enough delegates to become the nominee. ""Don't let the cynical manipulation by the corporate media silence your voices. This is a movement, not a coronation, and every vote matters,"" DeMoro said Tuesday.Many Sanders supporters have consistently decried the role of superdelegates, the party insiders who are free to choose whomever they want for president at the convention. But Clinton is also expected to clinch a majority of the pledged delegates after Tuesday's primaries. Monday's announcement by the AP wasn't the scenario the Clinton campaign wanted to see, either, since it would have looked better to claim the nomination based on pledged delegates rather than superdelegates.Sanders has long vowed to continue his fight all the way to the convention in Philadelphia in July, even if it means convincing superdelegates to ignore the fact that Clinton won the most pledged delegates to back him instead.But that scenario would likely cost him some support. Groups like MoveOn and DFA have long opposed allowing superdelegates to overturn the will of the people. For them, once the pledged delegates are in, it will be over.""In my mind, once a candidate has a majority of the regular delegates and a majority of the vote,"" Merkley said on MSNBC, ""that speaks for itself."""

""Why not?"" he replied Tuesday when The Huffington Post raised the possibility of having women serve as both president and vice president simultaneously.""I believe we should make up for lost time,"" he added. ""We've had all men.""Reid's response was stronger than what he said earlier Tuesday when reporters pressed him about comments made by Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who questioned if the country is ready for an all-woman ticket.""Is the country ready for two women? I don’t know,"" Tester, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said last week. Reid said he disagreed with those comments. ""We’ve had two men representing [America] -- the president and vice president -- for centuries,"" Reid told reporters. ""My personal feeling is I don’t see why you couldn’t have two women -- whoever they might be -- and they’d be as good as two men.""""Thank you,"" a smiling Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) interjected after hearing Reid's answer. Reid told HuffPost that Hillary Clinton -- who became the first woman presumptive presidential nominee for a major political party on Monday night -- can ""pick whoever she wants -- she has a wide choice of women to choose from.""If Clinton does secure the nomination, she'd be the first woman to do so in America's 240-year history. Reid has been quietly pushing for Clinton to pick Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as her running mate, and is reportedly looking into Massachusetts law on filling vacant Senate seats. He wouldn't comment further on it Tuesday.UPDATE: 8:22 p.m. -- Tester issued a statement later on Tuesday that walked back his comments.“I shouldn’t have said that and it doesn’t reflect my values,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""I have always believed that we need more women in leadership positions not fewer.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Reid as the Senate majority leader."

On top of that, Trump said Sunday that Muslim-American judges might be biased against him, too, because of his anti-Muslim remarks.So how do you square those kinds of comments -- and the suggestion that a federal judge can't be fair because of his or her ethnic heritage or religion -- with your support for your party's presidential nominee?

Murphy is a perfect representation of the revolving door between the Republican Party and the influence industry representing corporate power in Washington. During election seasons, he has worked to elect Republican presidential candidates including Bob Dole and Mitt Romney, and for years worked to influence policy at one of the most powerful Washington firms.Murphy is the former president of the Republican PR and lobbying powerhouse DCI Group. The firm is the foremost practitioner of the political dark arts in both elections and inside the Beltway. Before becoming president, “Uncle Murph,” as he reportedly referred to himself, ran the DCI Group’s grassroots division, which helped muster up actual humans to support the policies promoted by corporate clients.During Murphy’s time at the firm, DCI helped corporations, foreign governments and political campaigns -- often controversially. DCI worked as image consultants for the brutal military junta running Myanmar in 2002. In 2004, DCI ran the pro-George W. Bush outside groups Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and Progress for America. From 2000 to 2006, the firm published a “news” site called Tech Central Station that wrote stories that suited its corporate clients, with a heavy dose of content denying climate science, as desired by longtime DCI client ExxonMobil.These were just a small handful of DCI’s most high-profile efforts, but it is unlikely that Murphy was the mastermind. “He’s not a grand strategist,” one former colleague told The Huffington Post. He was known as a good manager who knew how to pull the right levers -- something the Trump team appears to need desperately. “In terms of operating the machinery, that's what he's good at, and that's what they need,” said the former colleague, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “If you've got a big ego, Murph's a good yes man.""Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort, himself a former lobbyist, brought Murphy on to the campaign after firing his previous hire as political director, Rick Wiley. Murphy is seen as more of a steady hand, a golfer and family man, not a hard-partying big personality like Wiley. Murphy was reportedly suggested for the position by former DCI Group head lobbyist Doug Davenport. Davenport was one of two DCI Group employees who quit Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign after a furor over the firm’s prior representation of the Myanmar junta.After Murphy rose to president, DCI Group pivoted away from lobbying toward the kind of AstroTurf campaigns -- artificially created grassroots support -- he had been in charge of in his previous position. The group ran campaigns against net neutrality and municipal broadband on behalf of AT&T and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, for lower corporate taxes through a coalition of the country's biggest corporations, and to pressure Argentina to fully pay back the hedge fund investors who purchased its distressed debt.In 2012, Murphy left DCI to lead the Republican National Committee’s independent expenditure effort to elect Romney. Trump, of course, has called Romney a “choke artist” and “failed candidate” who ""ran one of the worst campaigns, as you know, in presidential history.”For his part, Murphy may have seen the future of his party way back in 2010. In a blog post applauding the belligerent press conferences held by the recently elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, he wrote, “More than ever, my sense is that voters are first and foremost looking for leaders who are comfortable in their own skin and totally genuine in their interaction with the public. And though not the determining factor in this week’s election results, those with a 'tell-it-like-it-is' tone to their messaging did pretty well.""""So look for fewer canned answers honed by focus group analysis and more shooting from the hip,"" he concluded. ""Should be fun to watch.”Ryan Grim contributed reporting.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
8,POLITICS,Donald Trump Promised To Give Trump Vodka Proceeds To Charity -- But Never Did,Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-vodka-charity_us_575740f2e4b0a3d6fbd31033,"The donation, Trump said, was in ""honor of my late brother, Fred Trump.""",2016-06-07,"Donald Trump holds a bottle of his new line of vodka as he arrives for the Trump Vodka launch party by Drinks America on Jan. 17, 2007, in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Donald Trump announced in late 2005 that he was launching a Trump-branded vodka, many who knew him were flabbergasted. Trump has been a teetotaler his entire life, and he blames alcohol for the early death of his big brother, Freddy Trump.""I sort of hated doing it,"" Trump said at the time of his vodka-licensing deal. ""My brother, Fred, who was the best, ended up being an alcoholic. And I learned a lot about alcohol and alcoholism from Fred.""Perhaps to soothe his conscience, Trump said then that he would donate all the money he made from the deal to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the impaired-driving prevention group.""I’m going to give 100 percent of that money to them in honor of my late brother, Fred Trump,"" Trump wrote in December 2005. ""I guarantee you that Fred is looking down now and saying, 'That’s really the best thing to do.'""But MADD never received any money from Trump or his vodka. ""Conversation [with Trump] began in 2005,"" but ""MADD declined the donation in 2006 due to our policy against accepting donations from the sale of alcohol,"" a spokeswoman for the group said. Despite MADD's rebuff, Trump remained determined to give away his vodka proceeds. Or so he said. Trump recounted on Larry King's CNN show later in 2006 that ""a great company came to me and they wanted to do a vodka. I'm giving the money to charity."" Despite Trump's promises, there appears to be no record he donated money from Trump Vodka to charity. Neither Trump's campaign team nor a spokeswoman for his private business, the Trump Organization, provided The Huffington Post with any information about what happened to the Trump Vodka money. Questions surrounding the Trump Vodka proceeds are the latest entry on a list of promises Trump has made to donate money to charity, only to seemingly fail to follow through. In late May, The Washington Post revealed that Trump had not made good on a promise in January to donate $1 million to military veterans’ groups. Trump only cut a check after the Post's article was published on May 24, calling out the billionaire. Trump also faces questions about what happened to money from his most recent book, Crippled America, which he pledged to donate to charity. In May, Trump reported earning more than $1 million in royalties from the book. But there were no signs that he gave away any of it. His staff refused to answer questions. The company that licensed Trump Vodka ran out of money after a few years in production. In 2010, the Trump Vodka distillery went bankrupt, and a year later, the licensor, Drinks America, was sold to a Mexican company.""Trump may not be the person to blame for Trump Vodka’s bad timing, overmatched distillery, topless teenager, melted mini-bottles, retreat to China, or lost credit,"" writes Bloomberg's Max Abelson. ""But in his office a decade ago, after making sure the cameras were rolling, he chose to do a deal with people who didn’t have the money or experience behind them to win.""Trump, of course, disputes the characterization that Trump Vodka was a flop. It ""was a successful product, which continues to be popular abroad, and ultimately morphed into expanding my interests in the spirits industry,” Trump said in a statement to Bloomberg.Trump failed to mention that he sued Drinks America in 2011, alleging it failed to pay him the full amount promised from Trump Vodka. Trump demanded $4.8 million from his former partners, according to legal filings. There's no indication that Trump received the money, or that he gave any of it to charity.""I won’t put my name on just anything. I would never endorse a product that I don’t believe in,"" Trump wrote a few months after he launched Trump Vodka.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

But delegates in the state are awarded on a proportional basis, so even a loss there for Clinton would not be likely to stop her from securing her party's nomination and a likely general election contest with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Ahead of Puerto Rico's nominating contest, Clinton had been just 60 delegates shy of clinching the nomination, when including superdelegates, who consist of party leaders and elected senators, members of Congress and governors.Sanders is bracing for a prolonged fight that will run into the Democratic convention at the end of July.Networks reported huge voter turnout and long lines in Puerto Rico, with just over 430 polling stations open compared with over 2,000 in 2008.The island is suffering through a severe debt crisis, which has hampered basic government services."
10,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Needs To Convince Voters That She Won't Help Just Rich People,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-wealthy-americans-poll_us_5755dc60e4b0b60682dea41e,A new survey finds voters aren't convinced she's a champion of the average American.,2016-06-06,Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is seen as likely to favor the wealthy.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5755de6e130000a109383bcf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Four years ago, as President Barack Obama's campaign staff geared up for a race against Mitt Romney, it made a decision to define the GOP nominee as a heartless, out-of-touch business mogul -- ""a protector of the privileged at the expense of the middle class,"" as reporters Scott Wilson and Philip Rucker put it in 2012.This year's leading Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, has been testing out the same line of attack against her own businessman rival, Donald Trump. During a May rally in California, Clinton attacked Trump for welcoming the financial crisis as an opportunity to ""make some money for himself."" ""He said, 'I sort of hope that happens.' He actually said that,"" Clinton said, referring to the housing market crash. ""And now he says he wants to roll back the financial regulations that we have imposed on Wall Street to let them run wild again. Well I will tell you what: You and I together, we're not going to let him.""But while Obama's team was able to effectively paint Romney as a plutocrat, Clinton may struggle to draw an equally clear economic contrast between her and Trump. As a recent HuffPost/YouGov survey shows, both candidates are seen by a plurality of voters as likely to favor the wealthy.Just under half of voters think Trump's policies as president would favor the rich, while 16 percent believe they would favor the middle class, 2 percent think they would favor the poor and 20 percent think they would treat all groups equally. A smaller 36 percent plurality think Clinton's economic policies would favor the rich, with 21 percent predict they would favor the middle class, 15 percent that they would favor the poor and 12 percent that they would treat all the classes about the same.That's significantly less daylight than voters perceived between Obama and Romney in the last presidential election. A 53 percent majority of voters thought Romney's policies would favor the rich, while just 21 percent said the same of Obama's, according to a July 2012 poll conducted by CBS and The New York Times.Like Romney, Trump is seen as an ally of the rich. But Clinton has yet to establish herself as a convincing alternative.And unlike Romney, Trump has nodded to a sort of populist economic message, arguing against free trade and issuing appeals to voters who feel left behind. He also gains cover from his willingness to take outright contradictory stands on policies like taxing the wealthy or raising the minimum wage, ideas he's both espoused and opposed since declaring his candidacy last year. Seventy percent of Americans don't know what he thinks on the minimum wage, or doubt he has a clear position, a recent survey found.""Whereas Romney was a venture capitalist with an aloof, plutocratic manner who really did fervently support the Paul Ryan makers-versus-takers ideological vision of deep cuts to the safety net, Trump is posing as a kind of Man In The Street’s Billionaire,” The Washington Post's Greg Sargent wrote in May, noting that focus groups had found voters unsure of his stance on the economy.Economic issues, as in past election cycles, are at the top of voters' minds this year. A fervor for economic populism is also present, with deep worries about the current state of affairs spanning party lines. Fewer than a third of voters believe that the country's economic system is generally fair, with the rest saying it unfairly favors powerful interests. Most also say that corporations make too much profit, that jobs in their community are difficult to find and that national economic conditions are either fair or poor. But neither candidate yet has a clear lead on economic issues. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, voters are evenly split as to whether Clinton or Trump better understands the economic problems people in this country are having.Few voters think either politician is likely to improve their own financial situations. Just a quarter think Trump's policies would help them personally, while 36 percent believe the policies would hurt them. Clinton fares even worse on this measure, with only 16 percent of voters saying they'd personally benefit if she's elected, and 45 percent that they'd be negatively affected.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 12-13 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

That’s the way the world is. Noma was chosen because she was the best actress for the job.”The casting decision was first announced in December. At the time, the news prompted criticism from some fans who asked why “white Hermione” was going to be played be a black actress. British actress Emma Watson, who is white, played the role of Hermione in the “Harry Potter” films. However, as Rowling herself stressed, Hermione’s race and skin color were never actually specified in the books.Speaking with The Observer, Rowling responded to critics who claimed Hermione must be white because she “turned white from shock” in one of the books.“I had a bunch of racists telling me that because Hermione ‘turned white’ -- that is, lost color from her face after a shock -- that she must be a white woman, that I have a great deal of difficulty with,” Rowling said. “I decided not to get too agitated about it and simply state quite firmly that Hermione can be a black woman with my absolute blessing and enthusiasm.”“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” directed by Tony Award winner John Tiffany, is set 19 years after Harry defeated Voldemort as a teenager. The show will open at the Palace Theater in London at the end of July. Previews for the play begin on Tuesday."
14,POLITICS,"If Trump Is Winning, Why Aren't Congressional Republicans Losing Primaries?",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-congressional-republicans-primaries_us_5755a792e4b0ed593f14fe73,"In a year of supposed anger at the establishment, not a single congressional Republican has lost his or her primary.",2016-06-06,A popular theory behind the rise of Donald Trump is that voters are disenchanted with Washington and want an outsider. But they keep re-electing their Republican Congress members. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5755b27e160000ab02f9577b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump is almost certain to be the Republican nominee, voters are calling for seismic changes to our political system, and not a single Republican member of Congress has lost a primary this year. Um, what?There are plenty of theories on The Rise Of Trump -- some better than others -- but most explanations hinge on the extreme dissatisfaction voters have toward Washington and our current politics. In the Trump-is-a-hand-grenade scenario, voters chose the political neophyte in an effort to blow up government.But if Republican voters are truly trying to make rubble of the Capitol, why are those same voters turning out to the polls and re-electing their members of Congress at every turn?Ask Republican members of Congress, and they’ll do the verbal equivalent of scratching their heads.“Oh! Great question!” Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) excitedly told The Huffington Post. “I don’t have an answer to that.”A number of Republicans thought it was a surprising contrast -- “I don’t get it,” Blum said -- and most Republicans agreed that there was considerable outrage among voters.“I don’t think people are happy with Republicans,” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said.But if voters aren’t happy, why aren’t they supporting disruptive challengers?The most cogent Republican response seems to be that this goes back to “that adage,” in the words of Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), “people are upset with the way Congress works as a whole, but they like the individual.""That was a common explanation Republicans offered, in a butchering of the so-called “Fenno’s paradox,” named after political science Hall of Famer Richard Fenno and his seminal work, “If, as Ralph Nader Says, Congress is ‘the Broken Branch,’ How Come We Love Our Congressmen so Much?”Fenno noted that, when he visited congressional districts, constituents frequently told him their congressman was the best. That, coupled with incumbents winning re-election more than 90 percent of the time despite poor congressional approval ratings, led Fenno to observe a clear separation between how voters see Congress writ large and how they see their individual member of Congress.Still, all the incumbent advantage aside, it seems odd that Trump could rise to power in some populist fit of rage while voters go out and re-elect their congressmen. “I don’t disagree,” said Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), a conservative House Freedom Caucus member who was one of the first lawmakers to endorse Trump. “Maybe that’s a little strange, but it’s been a strange election year.”Except that, excusing Trump for a moment, maybe it’s not that weird.The last time no Republican lost a primary was 2004, and there are five other times in the last 30 years where only one Republican lost in a primary.On the Democratic side, this same dynamic is playing out. Voters who are feeling the Bern are still re-electing their Democratic representative. Only Chakka Fattah (D-Penn.), who’s mired in an ethics scandal, has lost his bid thus far.And this Tuesday, the dynamic will become less noteworthy, as at least one incumbent Republican will lose their seat when Reps. George Holding and Renee Ellmers square off in North Carolina because of redistricting.But isn’t it surprising if no true GOP challenger beats an incumbent this primary season, when roughly 20 million of 30 million Republican primary voters went for outsiders Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)?Not really, political scientists say.Robert Boatright, the author of Getting Primaried: The Changing Politics of Congressional Primary Challenges, told HuffPost that primary challengers are most often driven by outside groups. “I think the sorts of groups that have financed primary challenges in previous years are probably preoccupied with aiding Republican incumbents in states where Trump may be a drag on the ticket,” Boatright said.“Trump basically has so dominated people’s attention this year that conservative groups haven’t really tried to mount any challenges,” he added.In the highest-profile primary races -- like Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady’s race in north Houston, and the contest for Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster’s Pennsylvania seat -- both incumbents were able to raise massive sums of money to fend off their challengers, Steve Toth and Art Halvorson, respectively. (Halvorson may have a second chance to take down Shuster, after a preliminary vote count showed he might win the Democratic primary as a write-in candidate.)Trump likes to tout all the new voters he's brought into the party, but the truth is these aren't new voters; they're just general election voters who are new to voting in primaries. In some ways, these voters are doing what they almost always do: re-elect their congressman.It's true that congressional approval ratings are still in the toilet. The most recent Gallup poll in May showed that only 18 percent of respondents approve of the way Congress is handling its job. But those numbers are actually up from 11 percent in November, and they've been on a pretty steady rise this year. As Fenno pointed out decades ago, congressional approval ratings matter very little in re-election, particularly when voters clearly separate their member from Congress as a whole.And for all the populist bluster out there, the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, gas prices are at a national average of $2.33, and only 13 percent of Americans ""worry a great deal"" that they or someone in their family will be a victim of terrorism.Perhaps it's less notable that voters are re-electing their congressmen across the board, and more notable that they ever nominated Trump. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

""If anyone doesn’t believe a 3-year-old can scamper off very quickly, they’ve never had kids. Because they can, and they do."" The Cincinnati police concluded their investigation into the incident without recommending whether any charges should be filed against 32-year-old Michelle Gregg, sources told the Cincinnati Enquirer last week. However, the death of Harambe, a 17-year-old Western lowland silverback, has sparked intense criticism of all parties. Some people railed against the zoo for deciding to shoot the gorilla, while others have claimed the boy's mother should have provided better supervision.Deters said Harambe's death was ""tragic,"" but added, “It’s still an animal.

Cincinnati Zoo officials said they were ""devastated"" by Harambe's death and had not made the decision to shoot the animal lightly, but added that they stand by their actions because the gorilla was hurting the boy.

People on the scene who called 911 told dispatchers the gorilla ""slammed the baby into the wall"" and was ""dragging him around."" The boy was hospitalized with scrapes and a concussion. “The little boy himself had already been talking about wanting to go in, go in, get in the water and his mother is like, ‘No you’re not, no you’re not,’"" witness Kimberley Ann Perkins O’Connor told CNN. “Her attention was drawn away for seconds, maybe a minute, and then he was up and in before you knew it,"" O'Connor added.Gregg had a total of four children with her during the zoo visit, Deters said. ""All the witnessers who were in her view ... described a very attentive mother who simply turned her back to take care of another child,"" he said. ""That's not heedless indifference.""A petition calling for Child Protective Services to investigate Gregg following the incident garnered more than 60,000 signatures.But Deters said investigators had visited the family's home and were “impressed” by the care and attentiveness of the parents. “We are also very appreciative for the expressions of concern and support that have been sent to us,” the family said in a statement to ABC News. “Some have offered money to the family, which we do not want and will not accept. If anyone wishes to make a gift, we recommend a donation to the Cincinnati Zoo in Harambe’s name.”"
16,POLITICS,Top GOP Strategist Who Bashed Donald Trump Will Now Try To Get Him Elected,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alex-castellanos-trump-super-pac_us_5755c059e4b0ed593f151e14,This is how Republicans caved.,2016-06-06,"Once upon a time, GOP strategist Alex Castellanos said Trump had to be stopped.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5755c124130000fb07383b89.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The New York Times reported Sunday that a newly formed super PAC supporting Donald Trump has hired veteran Republican strategist Alex Castellanos to help produce ads against Hillary Clinton.On its face, this doesn't seem surprising. Castellanos previously advised primary candidate Mitt Romney in the 2008 presidential race. He is a staple on CNN, where he frequently opines as a conservative political commentator, and the chairman and founder of the consulting firm Purple Strategies. The super PAC he will lead, called Rebuilding America Now, is backed by real estate investor Tom Barrack, a longtime Trump friend.What makes Castellanos’ latest career move so striking, however, is his past sharp attacks against the GOP's presumptive nominee.Castellanos, a Cuban American, didn’t simply speak out against the corrosive influence of Trump’s candidacy on demographic groups that the GOP needs to curry favor with. Last fall, he actively urged top Republican donors to back an anti-Trump campaign, one of the earliest organized efforts to try to deny the controversial real estate developer the nomination. It failed, obviously, but it paved the way for the broader #NeverTrump movement, whose members are still holding firm -- for now.Castellanos isn’t the only member of the GOP establishment to perform such a brazen about-turn on Trump’s candidacy. In recent weeks, senior GOP leaders who used to proudly denounce the man and his incendiary rhetoric toward minorities (here’s looking at you, House Speaker Paul Ryan) have slowly joined the fold.But Castellanos' evolution is perhaps one of the best examples of how the GOP is shifting on Trump, from initially dismissing his slurs and calls to bigotry as antithetical to the Party of Lincoln, to celebrating him as the candidate who could retake the White House.Last August, after Trump rocketed to the top of the polls, Castellanos wrote a searing CNN op-ed in which he called the businessman a “strongman” with no true positions who would execute a mass power grab once elected to office.“He is not a Republican or a conservative,"" Castellanos declared. ""If we want to keep our future in our hands, we shouldn't put it in his.”That was once a common refrain among conservatives, which Trump's rivals foolishly failed to embrace, focusing instead on infighting amongst each other.Later that fall, Castellanos teamed up with former top Romney aide Gail Gitcho in reaching out to dozens of the party’s major donors -- including casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who is now supporting Trump, and hedge-fund manager Paul Singer -- in hopes of forming a super PAC to take down the former reality TV star. As part of the pitch, Castellanos “produced ads portraying Mr. Trump as unfit for the presidency,” according to The New York Times. The two strategists even argued that with Trump at the top of the ticket, the GOP would “lose the Senate, competitive gubernatorial elections and moderate House Republicans.”That, too, was a concern shared by top congressional Republicans. Before ultimately warming to him, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) warned in February that Trump's candidacy would be an “albatross around the down-ballot races.”In January, Castellanos blamed the GOP for Trump’s rise, telling ABC that “we don't appeal to young people, we don't appeal to millennials, we don't appeal to young women, we don't appeal to minorities. We appeal to only cranky old white guys like me.”After multiple Trump victories on March 1, Super Tuesday, resignation began to set in. Castellanos told The Washington Post that it was “too late” to stop Trump from winning the nomination. “If Trump is going to be our nominee, as I believe he is, it is our mission to support Trump and make him the best nominee and president possible,” he added.But the Post noted helpfully, Castellanos said he had “no interest working for the real estate mogul's campaign.”He still found plenty wrong in Trump’s approach in early April. Regarding the candidate's immigration plan and his proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Castellanos predicted there would be a “cleansing” after Trump lost the primary race.“And I think you will see a new, and better, and more optimistic, solution-oriented Republican Party going into the general election,” he said.Within a month, however, Castellanos’ capitulation was complete. In a CNN interview in early May, he urged fellow Republicans to hold their noses and rally around Trump because Clinton would be a far more disastrous option.“You know, when nothing is working, the most dangerous thing you can do is more of the same,” he said. “And that's the choice I think is going to unite a lot of Republicans to say, look, forget never Trump. This is about never Hillary.”Many Republicans previously wary of Trump have taken this advice with gusto. Ignoring much else, they have talked themselves into supporting Trump by citing his list of potential Supreme Court nominees. They have convinced themselves that Trump would control himself and respect limits on executive power once in office, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said last week. It is a dubious bet given Trump’s penchant for reversing himself on every issue seemingly every week.That Castellanos is willing to hold his own nose in support of a Republican candidate shouldn't actually shock anybody. He has done it before.In 1990, he produced an infamously racist ad (see above) on behalf of the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who was known for opposing all kinds of civil rights measures, from racial issues to gay equality. (Helms even fought the establishment of a federal holiday in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.) The ad, entitled “Hands,” featured a pair of white hands crumpling a rejection letter as the narrator intoned that the job had gone to “a minority because of a racial quota.”It was a prime example of the “Southern Strategy,” which the GOP has employed to various degrees for decades. Now Trump's campaign makes similarly unapologetic appeals to racial and cultural resentment among working-class whites. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

When Ali, known as ""the greatest of all time,"" reached out to speak to Fox, the actor was understandably nervous. But he worked up the courage to call his idol back. ""Finally, I called from the bathroom phone so I wouldn't be interrupted. One foot was up on the toilet lid, and the phone was up to my ear. You could tell on the phone he was very quiet at first, and you could hear him breathing. I'm thinking, 'That is Muhammad Ali breathing, and that's his phone,'"" he said. ""Very quietly, he said, 'I'm sorry you have this [disease], but with you in the fight, we have a better chance of winning.'""Fox and Ali went on to film a PSA together for the actor's Foundation for Parkinson's Research. ""When we were shooting our commercial in Arizona, I realized that no matter how famous you are, no matter how big a TV star you are -- or whatever flimsy kinds of fame I had -- you're invisible when you're with Muhammad Ali,"" Fox said. ""You're anonymous."" He added, ""He was global. He reached every corner of the Earth.

The cereal maker, responsible for childhood favorites such as Trix and Lucky Charms, has created Tiny Toast to fill your next morning bowl.Apparently the drop in cereal sales over the past decade didn't discourage General Mills from investing in a new product, but rather encouraged them to shift their focus from colorful marshmallows -- the best part of any '90s breakfast -- to using real fruit to flavor their Strawberry and Blueberry Tiny Toast. In an effort to appeal to the more health-conscious consumer, the new cereal is also free of high fructose corn syrup and contains no artificial flavors or colors. But whether or not it will lure the granola munchers is still unknown.The Tiny Toast website boasts that one serving of the cereal contains only 9 grams of sugar. To put that into perspective, it's the same amount as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and one gram less than Lucky Charms (but without any of the beloved marshmallows). Chew on that.One thing we can say with certainty, this new cereal is hoping to catch the attention of millennials -- the demographic cereal companies have the hardest time attracting. How?

The woman's children witnessed her death as she attempted to flee from Buck.To sentence Buck to death, the jury needed to conclusively find that he posed a future danger to society. The jurors heard testimony from a defense expert who offered several statistical factors that he said could affect a person's ""future dangerousness.""Among these factors -- which included a person's criminal record and substance abuse history -- was the person's race. When called to the stand to elaborate on this point, the expert said, ""It’s a sad commentary that minorities, Hispanics and black people are overrepresented in the criminal justice system.""Later, when asked by the prosecution to confirm whether ""the race factor, black, increases the future dangerousness for various complicated reasons,"" the expert simply answered, ""Yes.""Following deliberations, the jury recommended a death sentence.Now that the Supreme Court has intervened in the case, the justices will give a second look at Buck's sentencing and determine whether he deserves a new one.Justice Sonia Sotomayor likely played a role in giving Buck a chance to make his case. She was among the justices who in 2011 agreed to temporarily halt his execution while the court considered whether his claims of racial bias had enough merit to warrant a full hearing.By the time Buck got the news his execution had been put on hold at the eleventh hour, he had already had his final meal. He expressed gratitude for the justices' move.""God is worthy to be praised. God's mercy triumphs over judgment, and I feel good,"" Buck said, according to the Texas Tribune.But two months later, the Supreme Court decided not to take up Buck's case, drawing a strong dissent from Sotomayor.""Today the Court denies review of a death sentence marred by racial overtones and a record compromised by misleading remarks and omissions made by the State of Texas,"" she wrote, joined only by Justice Elena Kagan.Justice Samuel Alito, for his part, agreed that the racially charged testimony in Buck's case was ""bizarre and objectionable,"" but countered that Buck's case didn't merit review because it was his defense lawyer, not the prosecutor, who submitted the expert who relied on race as a valid metric for whether a person poses a future threat to society. The late Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Stephen Breyer joined Alito in his opinion.""Thus, this is the only case in which it can be said that the responsibility for eliciting the offensive testimony lay squarely with the defense,"" Alito said.The Supreme Court is expected to hold oral arguments in Buck v.

But we haven't really improved all that much since then.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5754229b120000250089568e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 2016 primary has seen its share of voting day outrages, from onerous voter ID laws to questionable voter purges. In Arizona, residents waited in line all day to vote; in one county, voting locations were cut from 200 to 60 spots. An election official blamed the residents, saying they should have voted absentee.America remains terrible at making voting easy, 16 years after collectively pledging to get it right.Little has changed since the fall of 2000 and the unimaginable presidential election results between then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. With the presidential race in the balance, Florida showed just how haphazard and unjust voting can be; the courts -- in decisions to extend the recount and, more controversially, to ultimately end it -- made clear that campaigns can and do extend into the judiciary.On the day of the election, Ron Klain, who handled rapid-response with the Gore campaign, had been stationed at their Nashville headquarters (the site had been an old mortuary). The campaign’s data had actually showed that it was likely that Gore would win the Electoral College vote but not the popular one. It fell to Klain to craft talking points if the campaign’s prediction came true. As Klain told The Huffington Post’s ""Candidate Confessional"" podcast, no one anticipated the need for a recount. “The idea that thousands of votes would affect a presidential election seemed far-fetched to almost any human being on the morning of Election Day 2000,” he said.Klain was a 39-year-old lawyer who’d been forced out once by the Gore team during an early campaign shake up. He worked inside the mortuary's kitchen. But by the end of the very long night, he was preparing to fly down to Tallahassee, Florida, to take command for the campaign. He told his wife he’d be home by that Saturday.”We didn’t really know what we were going down there to do,” Klain said. Most close elections sort themselves out in the first day or two. Someone turns up a missing box of ballots. An election official discovers a misplaced decimal point. The nail-biter turns out to be rather uneventful.It didn’t take Klain long to figure out that this election wouldn’t be coming to a clean, prompt conclusion, that there were multiple irregularities to figure out and perhaps contest. Palm Beach County's butterfly ballot design had so confused voters – many of whom were elderly – that they ended up voting for Pat Buchanan when their ballots had been meant for Gore. A bunch of counties threw out votes. And then there were the shenanigans the Gore campaign wouldn’t even know about until it was too late. Eighteen counties failed to do the required automatic recounting (the technical term is ""recanvass"") -- a massive error covering more than a quarter of all votes cast on Election Day. As Jeffrey Toobin noted in his book Too Close to Call: The Thirty-Six-Day Battle to Decide the 2000 Election, this failure could have meant a big swing in Gore’s favor. “In Lake County, which did not run its ballots through the machines, the Orlando Sentinel found 376 uncounted ballots clearly intended as votes for Al Gore -- and 246 uncounted ballots showing clear votes for George W. Bush,” Toobin reported. “The swing in just this one county -- where Gore would have netted 130 votes -- illustrates how important a true recount might have been.”Still, Bush’s lead would dwindle to a few hundred votes. Meanwhile, Gore’s team had identified four counties that had issues and protested the results in each —Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Volusia. The battleground was county election offices. The mission was simple: analyze every ballot and those infamous chads -- dimpled or half-torn -- and decide whether there were votes that weren't counted but should have been.“I was nervous because the stakes were incredibly high. ... I was nervous because every day the forces were aligned to try to shut us down, to end the recount,” Klain said. “There’s tremendous pressure to end the recount -- pressure from people in our own party too. I mean, [former Senator] Bill Bradley went on TV and said Gore should give up. And [former Labor Secretary] Robert Reich went on TV and said this was kind of crazy. We had a lot of pressure from a lot of people saying like, ‘It’s time for this to end,’ and our main goal was to just to kind of keep it going.”Though the fate of the presidency rested on the outcome, Klain said he didn't view his job as inherently political. The theory of winning from the perspective of Gore's team was more about math and election law and not so much shaping public opinion. The Bush team saw it differently, deftly working the media and local officials to paint the opposition as sore losers. ""I think that was a mistake we made,"" Klain conceded. ""We viewed it as more of a legal thing where we were trying to ascertain what the proper count of the votes would be. The Bush folks took a more political approach. They saw it as more of a political war.”Of course, Bush and Co. had a number of other factors in their favor too. The candidate's brother Jeb Bush happened to be the governor. Florida’s secretary of state, Katherine Harris, happened to have co-chaired George Bush's election efforts in Florida. GOP operatives, white-shoe law firms and Tallahassee opportunists understood where the power inside the state resided. Many were reluctant to give Gore a hand.""They ran the state,"" Klain said of the Bush campaign. But, he added, they had a more important advantage: ""They were ahead.""As reported by Toobin, the Bush team, led by former Secretary of State James Baker III, relied on all manner of stall tactics to thwart Klain’s efforts. They used court subpoenas to prevent officials from counting votes and at one point, Toobin wrote, “the Bush forces in Broward accused Democratic observers of eating chads.”“The Bush people just wanted to shut the thing down. And the only way to change their view on shutting the thing down was to have the count go from us being behind to us being ahead,” Klain said. “And our view always was if you could ever get us ahead then all the sudden the Bush people would need to have more votes counted. Their whole perspective on counting or not counting would change once they were behind.”But the sides never ended up flipping. The night before the Supreme Court’s decision, Florida’s highest court had ordered a recount in all counties. The recount had begun the following morning. “We were gaining votes,” Klain said. “We thought we would probably be ahead by late afternoon. ... It was all good.”But then the Supreme Court stepped in and ordered the recount to end on the grounds that it violated the Equal Protection Clause to have different recount standards in different counties. Bush remained in the lead. “You could have knocked me over with a feather,” Klain said. “The idea that the court would issue an extraordinary order to stop the counting of ballots on the theory that counting votes did irreparable harm to George W. Bush was an astonishing idea.” A comprehensive examination of the ballots showed that the court, in the end, may not have thwarted a Gore victory -- especially if the recount was just in the four disputed counties the vice president had originally challenged. A group of media outlets did find that if there was a full statewide recount of rejected ballots, Gore may have won. While the outcome, to this day, remains painful for Klain and Democrats, there was a hope that, at minimum, the Florida recount would spark meaningful reform in how elections are conducted. The problems in Florida were so vast -- The New York Times Magazine reported that some 180,000 votes were rejected because of poorly designed ballots or legal challenges, while three times as many discarded ballots came from black voting precincts -- that changes seemed inevitable. But in many respects, things have only gotten worse. New voter ID laws have effectively disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of people across the country. In various states (including Florida) there have been laws to curb voter registration drives. Some states have reduced early voting hours. In others (again, Florida) there have been efforts to restrict the restoration of voting rights to people with past criminal convictions. In 2013, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, weakening the federal government's ability to ensure racial parity when it comes to the right to vote. Klain still thinks about the recount several times a week. He said there’s been no shortage of reminders. “It just inflames me that we still let people be disenfranchised,” he said. “All the stuff that still goes on is just enraging to me.”Voter turnout in the 2012 election was 53.6 percent, according to Pew Research, one of the worst levels in the developed world. The highest, by contrast, was Belgium with 87.2 percent.This podcast was edited by Christine Conetta. It is the final episode of the first season of ""Candidate Confessional."""
24,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Campaign Is Already An Absolute Garbage Fire,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-campaign-discord_us_5755dac4e4b07823f950ffe8,This is just getting embarrassing.,2016-06-06,Trump's team is reportedly not on the same page as the boss.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5755e1a3130000a109383bdb.jpeg?ops=crop_8_119_3460_2117%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"We're only a few weeks into the presumptive general election, and the wheels are already coming off Donald Trump's presidential campaign.The Trump team is struggling with internal discord over his overtly racist tirade against a federal judge, MSNBC's Katy Tur and Benjy Sarlin reported Monday. Trump has repeatedly accused the judge, who was born in Indiana, of bias against him due to the judge's Mexican heritage.Via MSNBC:Trump’s comments against the judge horrified many supporters, but the real estate mogul rebuffed efforts by campaign staff, donors and party officials to back off the incendiary claim this weekend, per sources, telling them he was unwilling to look like he had caved to pressure.But that wasn't the worst news on Monday.In a conference call, which was revealed in this remarkable Bloomberg story, Trump instructed supporters and surrogates to follow his lead in questioning the judge's credibility. Furthermore, he directed those on the call to impugn critical reporters as racists for questioning his line of attack.""We will overcome,"" Trump said, according to two sources who spoke to Bloomberg. (Yes, he seemingly invoked the protest song ""We Shall Overcome,"" which is closely associated with the civil rights movement.)Even more shocking was the reported lack of coordination between the candidate and his small campaign staff. Per Bloomberg: When former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer interrupted the discussion to inform Trump that his own campaign had asked surrogates to stop talking about the lawsuit, Trump repeatedly demanded to know who sent the memo, and immediately overruled his staff.But Brewer, who has said she is open to serving as Trump's vice president, still wasn't satisfied with that. ""You all better get on the page,"" she told him, according to Bloomberg.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

He announced Monday that the media company has terminated a previously agreed-upon advertising deal with the RNC.Peretti specifically cited presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's rhetoric in an email to staff explaining the decision, saying Trump's campaign policies are “directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world.”Peretti acknowledged BuzzFeed's termination of the deal means it's walking away from a ""significant amount"" of money.""We don’t need to and do not expect to agree with the positions or values of all our advertisers,"" Peretti wrote in the email. ""And as you know, there is a wall between our business and editorial operations. This decision to cancel this ad buy will have no influence on our continuing coverage of the campaign.""""We certainly don’t like to turn away revenue that funds all the important work we do across the company. However, in some cases we must make business exceptions: we don’t run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we won’t accept Trump ads for the exact same reason.""Here's the entire text of Peretti's email to staffers:Hello BuzzFeeders,In December, BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith informed reporters that referring to Trump as a ""liar"" and a ""mendacious racist"" was fair game because the terms are accurate reflections of his campaign.""BuzzFeed News’s reporting is rooted in facts, not opinion; these are facts,"" Smith explained at the time. ""There’s nothing partisan about accurately describing Donald Trump.""Neither BuzzFeed nor the RNC responded to a request for comment from The Huffington Post. On Tuesday, however, RNC communications director Sean Spicer accused the website of being ""in the tank"" for Democrats and Hillary Clinton, after BuzzFeed published a story on two Hispanic operatives who declined roles with the Republican party over disagreements with Trump:Update: This story has been updated with Sean Spicer's Twitter commentary.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Elijah Mohammad preached a version that denounced white oppression and opposed integration of the races.Ali came to be widely revered, but there was a time when he was rejected, mostly by whites by also by some black leaders for his bold statements against white supremacy and for his refusal to embrace the model epitomized by Martin Luther King, a Christian.“The sanitizing of Ali’s image in recent years has led many to forget that he was reviled by many during the 1960s for his conversion to Islam and for his refusal to be inducted into the U.S. armed forces,” said Frank Guridy, a visiting associate professor of history at Columbia University.“He was seen as a traitor to the United States of America.”In the 1970s, Ali converted to Sunni Islam, the largest denomination among Muslims worldwide, and embraced Sufism, a mystical school of the faith.At the gathering of Muslim-American leaders in Washington, speaker after speaker remembered him fondly as the Muslim who Americans came to love.Ali defended Muslims last December, after Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump proposed temporarily stopping Muslims from entering the country in the wake of Islamist militant attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.“Our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people’s views on what Islam really is,” Ali said in a statement.He also used his influence to advocate the release of Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who spent 18 months in a Iranian prison, and for Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was captured by Islamic extremists in Pakistan and later beheaded in 2002.“Muhammad Ali was a gift from God,” said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, “not only to Muslims but to the world.”"

Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) took a not-so-subtle dig at the racism of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in a tweet on Monday.Sasse never mentioned Trump's name, but one can assume he's addressing the business mogul's offensive comments about federal judge Gonzalo Curiel. The judge, who was born in the U.S. to Mexican immigrants, is handling two lawsuits against Trump University, and last week Trump said his ethnicity prevented him from being able to do his job impartially. “He’s a Mexican,” Trump said in a Friday CNN interview. “We’re building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings — rulings that people can’t even believe.”Trump also called the judge a “hater."" Many Republican leaders have criticized Trump’s comments but have stopped short of calling them racist.Sasse, who is in his first term, has been very vocal against his own party's presidential front-runner. In February, he wrote a lengthy Facebook post saying he won’t vote for Trump no matter the circumstance.“A presidential candidate who boasts about what he’ll do during his ‘reign’ and refuses to condemn the KKK cannot lead a conservative movement in America,” Sasse wrote.Last November, Sasse told his colleagues in his maiden speech on the Senate floor, “The people despise us all.""According to Politico, Sasse said he might vote for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson in November, but added he “hadn’t really looked closely at it yet.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
