""Libraries have never been used more,"" Marx told Huffington, who noted that 90 percent of Americans believe that public libraries are a vital aspect of their communities. ""People are shocked by this: the New York Public Libraries together get about 40 million physical visits a year,"" more than all the city's museums and professional sporting events combined, he said. ""The life of the mind is not nearly as threatened as popular culture would have us believe."" Yet 27 percent of households in New York City lack a connection to broadband Internet. Marx told a story about a boy who was sitting outside a library branch in the South Bronx to use the Wi-Fi after it had closed. ""There's a kid sitting on the stoop and he's got the oldest laptop I've ever seen. And I said, 'What are you doing?' And he said, 'I'm doing my math homework,'"" Marx said. ""It's New York, it's the 21st century, and the kid's sitting on the stoop to do his math homework.""Guarded by Patience and Fortitude, a pair of imposing marble lions, the main branch of the New York Public Library at East 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue is world-renowned and among the largest libraries in the world. Marx works to broaden the library's essential role as a provider of free educational opportunities for millions of New Yorkers. Among Marx's initiatives since joining the NYPL, with $1 million in funding from Google and backing from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, the library began offering free Wi-Fi devices, with a goal to reach approximately 10,000 low-income families so they can access the system from home. The FCC passed last year a $5 billion plan for schools and libraries to follow suit in an effort to address the digital divide on a national scale.Considering the dramatic socioeconomic split in accessibility to information, the public library plays an important role as it continues to adapt to digital technology.""Libraries are called the 'third place,'"" explained Huffington. ""It's not home, it's not work, but it's a place of community and despite all the fears that the digital revolution would eliminate libraries, it's the exact opposite.""Marx served as president of Amherst College from 2003 to 2011, and presided over the largest unrestricted cash gift ever made to a liberal arts college ($100 million). He arrived at the New York Public Library in 2011, at a time when the institution was facing many questions about its place in an increasingly digital future.""When I got to [NYPL], I realized that most of the commercial publishing industry wouldn't let libraries lend electronic books. So we found a way to make deals where we pay licensing fees, because authors should be paid for their work,"" Marx said. ""We have seen a 300 percent increase in electronic book lending.""Aside from increasing accessibility, Marx's vision for the future of the public library system addresses the unique role it plays within the community, especially those with low-income residents. ""We're human beings. We're social animals. Even if you don't need to come to the library to read a book, people come to the library to be together and to be in inspiring spaces,"" he said.""You could watch all of this online,"" he said, referencing the Aspen Ideas Festival as an environment that fosters critical thinking. ""But you want to be here talking to each other, learning together. That's amazing and we need to do more of that.""As a leading provider of basic and advanced computer-skills training in New York City, the NYPL helps New Yorkers keep up the pace with an accelerating tech industry. ""The coding industry -- the tech industry -- is the fastest growing industry in New York,"" said Marx. ""It's a, let's say, non-diverse industry, so we're trying to get them some of the diversity of talent by providing the coding instruction for free."" Examining extremes, Huffington and Marx discussed the downsides of an oversaturated Internet experience. From mass media to social media, they agreed that sometimes people just want ever-elusive ""quiet and contemplation."" ""I think we're at this moment when we all are so grateful for what the digital revolution has made possible, but we're beginning to recognize the dangers,"" said Huffington. ""We're beginning to recognize the dangers in terms of our health, in terms of our creativity, because that quiet place -- I mean, every creator has said it's essential, you know, being able to clean your mind and not be constantly focused on notifications and alerts and bleeps.""On the same side of the divide, noting the importance of ""preserving the library as an oasis,"" Huffington lamented the decreasing frequency with which humans disconnect from devices to engage with the world around them. ""Even museums and galleries now are all digitized, and people walk around with their apps -- I mean, I'm sure you've been to museums where people are not looking at the paintings, they're looking at their apps, and you wonder why they left home,"" she said.The crux of his vision, Marx concluded, relies upon a certain parity in access to information throughout the world. ""I’m after two things that I’m not sure I will live to see, [but] I want a world in which the opportunities that we all have here in Aspen, that we all have at home, are shared by everyone. I want a world in which access to ideas and information, to learn from and to contribute to, is not constrained by economic opportunity or physical proximity,"" said Marx. ""I want everyone in the game because I believe, going back to some early Greek thinkers, that intelligence and talent and wisdom and creativity are more widely spread in the community than we have yet to tap.""For all the wisdom of the Aspen Ideas Festival, said Marx, without engagement from two-thirds of the world's population, innovation stagnates. ""So that's No. 1,"" he said. ""And No. 2, more mundane. I want to go on the subway every morning, and instead of seeing people moving little balls around the screen, I want to see them working with the collections of the library on whatever they're fascinated by, contributing to a collective effort to understand the world better. Those are the two things I'm after."""

6,STYLE,Hugo Boss Says It Plans To Go Fur Free By 2016,Carly Ledbetter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hugo-boss-fur-free_us_559c31b5e4b0759e2b511c4e,Let's hope other brands follow suit.,2015-07-08,"BERLIN, GERMANY - JANUARY 19: A model walks the runway at the Hugo by Hugo Boss Autumn/Winter 2012 fashion show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Berlin at Gemaldegalerie on January 19, 2012 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Peter Michael Dills/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559c39931400007c00eb7ffe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Luxury fashion brand Hugo Boss will be going ""fur free"" as of its Fall/Winter 2016 collection, the brand announced earlier this week.In a statement from Hugo Boss's 2014 Sustainability Report, the brand says it will reach ""100% cessation of the use of farmed fur such as raccoon dog, fox, or rex rabbit in all collections from 2016."" Bernd Ludwig Keller, brand and creative director of sportswear, elaborated on the brand's fur-free mission: ""As one of the leading companies in the premium and luxury segment, we have a great deal of responsibility. In our view, sourcing down feathers from the plucking of live animals is not ethical and we have therefore taken the decision to reject this practice. When purchasing merino wool, we give preference to suppliers, who do not use the painful mulesing procedure on their animals. We also have high standards for the use of fur from farmed animals: from our Fall/Winter 2016 Collection onward, we will no longer be using raccoon dog or rex rabbits. This means we will not be using any farmed fur in any of our HUGO BOSS clothing collections and are sending out a clear signal.""Around 80 percent of the fashion industry's fur comes from fur farms, where animals are killed for their coats. The Fur Free Alliance, an international coalition that works to end the exploitation and killing of animals for fur, issued a statement commending Hugo Boss for its efforts, saying: ""HUGO BOSS has become a leader in the fashion world by taking a stand against animal cruelty and ending the use of fur in collections. The Fur Free Alliance hopes other luxury brands will follow HUGO BOSS’s lead, especially since there are now so many cruelty-free alternatives that are fashionable and indistinguishable from the real thing."" The Humane Society pointed out that this announcement comes on the heels of a New York Times article that says fur is back, though many retailers and designers are choosing to not include fur in their collections. As of right now, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Stella McCartney and Ralph Lauren do not support the use of fur. To learn about more retailers that do not support the use of fur, check out the Humane Society's website.  The Huffington Post reached out to Hugo Boss to find out more about their commitment to going fur-free and will update this post accordingly. H/T WWD  Also on HuffPost: "
7,RELIGION,How Black Churches Are Helping Their Communities Get Access To Healthy Food,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-churches-baltimore-food-justice_us_559c5622e4b04e28f1e52ec1,Jesus made a revolutionary statement when he stood on the Mount of Olives and declared: “For I was hungry and you gave me,2015-07-08,"<p>Rev. Heber Brown III and Aleya Fraser, co-founder of Black Dirt Farm, hold up produce from the farm.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559c5e631800002f00b9c026.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jesus made a revolutionary statement when he stood on the Mount of Olives and declared: “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in. ... Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” Today, millions around the world live without food security -- access to safe, nutritious food. A group of pastors, farmers and community leaders in Baltimore -- where one in four residents lives in a food desert, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future -- are joining forces to tackle the issue head on.Rev. Dr. Heber Brown, who heads Pleasant Hope Baptist Church in Baltimore, is spearheading the Black Church Food Security Network in conjunction with the Baltimore Food and Faith Project of the Johns Hopkins Center For a Livable Future and Black Dirt Farm, a local group of urban farmers who grow food on the historic land of Harriet Tubman on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Their aim is to bring together black churches and black farmers to provide their communities with healthy, nutritious food. The network is launching with two events -- a worship service and produce sale on Wednesday at Ark Church, a partner house of worship, and an urban gardening project on Saturday at the 1800 block of Aisquith Street.“Food deserts in Baltimore overwhelmingly affect black people,” said Darriel Harris, an ordained minister and project officer of the Baltimore Food and Faith Project. “The black church is an institution that is both housed in these areas and managed by people who live in or have significant ties to these areas.”The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines a food desert as an urban neighborhood or rural town that lacks easy access to fresh, healthy and affordable food. Such communities are often served only by fast food restaurants or convenience stores where fresh foods are scarce. Residents frequently suffer from obesity, diabetes and heart disease as a result of poor diets. Food deserts are by and large found in lower-income areas -- and they affect black and Hispanic neighborhoods in particular. In a study published in October 2013, Johns Hopkins researcher Dr. Kelly Bower found that at equal poverty levels with their white counterparts, black neighborhoods had fewer supermarkets. In Baltimore, 34 percent of the city’s African American population lives without access to fresh, healthy foods, compared to just 8 percent of white residents. The Black Church Food Security Network, Harris told The Huffington Post, is an example in which “those most impacted by the problem have come up with a solution.”Food justice came to the forefront of Brown’s mind five years ago when he was a new pastor at Pleasant Hope and found himself visiting members of his congregation in the hospital up to four times a week. “I realized the people I served were in the hospital, many of them, because of diet-related issues,” he told HuffPost.At that point, he and the staff at Pleasant Hope transformed the church’s yard into a small urban garden, which today produces 400-500 hundred pounds of fresh produce each season. The church’s bounty -- which includes broccoli, tomatoes, kale, beets, radishes and more depending on the season -- is available by donation after Sunday services.When violence broke out following the death of Freddie Gray in April, Brown said, the reality of food deserts became painfully apparent. “Many corner stores were affected during the uprising and out of commission.

Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” Today, millions around the world live without food security -- access to safe, nutritious food. A group of pastors, farmers and community leaders in Baltimore -- where one in four residents lives in a food desert, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future -- are joining forces to tackle the issue head on.Rev. Dr. Heber Brown, who heads Pleasant Hope Baptist Church in Baltimore, is spearheading the Black Church Food Security Network in conjunction with the Baltimore Food and Faith Project of the Johns Hopkins Center For a Livable Future and Black Dirt Farm, a local group of urban farmers who grow food on the historic land of Harriet Tubman on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Their aim is to bring together black churches and black farmers to provide their communities with healthy, nutritious food. The network is launching with two events -- a worship service and produce sale on Wednesday at Ark Church, a partner house of worship, and an urban gardening project on Saturday at the 1800 block of Aisquith Street.“Food deserts in Baltimore overwhelmingly affect black people,” said Darriel Harris, an ordained minister and project officer of the Baltimore Food and Faith Project. “The black church is an institution that is both housed in these areas and managed by people who live in or have significant ties to these areas.”The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines a food desert as an urban neighborhood or rural town that lacks easy access to fresh, healthy and affordable food. Such communities are often served only by fast food restaurants or convenience stores where fresh foods are scarce. Residents frequently suffer from obesity, diabetes and heart disease as a result of poor diets. Food deserts are by and large found in lower-income areas -- and they affect black and Hispanic neighborhoods in particular. In a study published in October 2013, Johns Hopkins researcher Dr. Kelly Bower found that at equal poverty levels with their white counterparts, black neighborhoods had fewer supermarkets. In Baltimore, 34 percent of the city’s African American population lives without access to fresh, healthy foods, compared to just 8 percent of white residents. The Black Church Food Security Network, Harris told The Huffington Post, is an example in which “those most impacted by the problem have come up with a solution.”Food justice came to the forefront of Brown’s mind five years ago when he was a new pastor at Pleasant Hope and found himself visiting members of his congregation in the hospital up to four times a week. “I realized the people I served were in the hospital, many of them, because of diet-related issues,” he told HuffPost.At that point, he and the staff at Pleasant Hope transformed the church’s yard into a small urban garden, which today produces 400-500 hundred pounds of fresh produce each season. The church’s bounty -- which includes broccoli, tomatoes, kale, beets, radishes and more depending on the season -- is available by donation after Sunday services.When violence broke out following the death of Freddie Gray in April, Brown said, the reality of food deserts became painfully apparent. “Many corner stores were affected during the uprising and out of commission. Entire neighborhoods were hungry and without food.”The pastor spent his days driving food from the church’s garden around to various pick-up spots around the city, but it was time to take the initiative further. With the help of Black Dirt Farm and the Baltimore Food and Faith Project, the Black Church Food Security Network was born. Both Brown and Harris hope to scale the network so that churches around the city become “conduits of health.”“The black church is a lasting institution in the black community and general community that specifically is vested in the life of black people,” Harris said. “What better institution to address a problem that negatively impacts so many blacks?”“Faith communities teach us how to live.

Considering the fact that kombucha has reached multi-million dollar industry level, it's high time we all get to the bottom of what this drink is made of.  Kombucha is fermented sweet tea that has been enjoyed throughout Asia for centuries. It is most commonly made with black, oolong, green or white tea and is sometimes mixed with juices for additional flavor. The sweetened-with-sugar tea is made by adding bacteria and yeast to it and letting it sit for about 2-4 weeks to ferment. The final product is not sweet, the sugar is added just to aid in the fermentation process. During fermentation a scoby is formed. This is a scoby:We know, it looks gross. But it's this gelatinous layer that makes kombucha that fizzy, vinegary beverage we can't stop drinking. Scoby is an acronym for symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast. (The stuff floating around in store-bought kombucha is basically a scoby beginning to form.) Not only is it responsible for fermenting tea into kombucha but it also protects the tea from bad bacteria trying to get in from the outside. The scoby often time sits on top of the tea, and serves as a natural seal. It also sometimes sinks to the bottom or floats around in the middle. Kind of like this: The pictures above are of home-brewed kombucha. It is this stuff, not the store-bought kind, that has sometimes given kombucha a bad rap. While kombucha is easy enough to make at home -- the scoby too -- it does involve working with bacteria which can be dangerous if one's not careful. Basically, homebrewers have to make sure to use squeaky-clean ingredients and follow directions to a tee. (Pun not intended). If not, the drinking of home-brewed kombucha can pose some side effects ranging from upset stomachs to infections. But folks drink and brew kombucha nonetheless, many because they believe that it provides alternative health benefits. Believers think kombucha can stimulate the immune system, prevent cancer, and improve digestion and liver function, but no medical evidence can yet support those claims. So, in sum, brew at your own risk, drink for pleasure and revel in the fact that you finally know what kombucha actually is.Related on HuffPost:"

12,SPORTS,NBA Free Agency Winners And Losers,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nba-free-agency_0_n_7744786.html,,2015-07-08,"Portland Trail Blazers' LaMarcus Aldridge (12) drives around San Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan (21) during the second half on an NBA basketball game, Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, in San Antonio. Portland won 109-100. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7816f2400005000988e43.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NBA free agency may not be officially over, but the marquee dominoes are off the board and we can start to evaluate what has happened. Kevin Love turned out to be telling the truth all along when he said he would return to Cleveland, while LaMarcus Aldridge opted for a return to his home state of Texas to play for San Antonio. Plenty more happened, though, so let's take a look at the winners and losers of free agency sweepstakes 2015. If you missed it, here is my piece on the draft's winners and losers.WINNERSSpursHardly a free agency fixture under Gregg Popovich, this is an organization that has largely done its damage through the draft. Inking Aldridge, a four-time All-Star and three-time All-NBA selection with endless offensive ability, to a sparkling new max contract worth $80 million over four years sustains the Spurs' championship window that much longer. He allows Tim Duncan -- perhaps in his final year -- to play fewer minutes and the opportunity to be defended without the slew of double teams. Moreover, Aldridge, an elite pick-and-pop big man, can run it from anywhere on the floor with Tony Parker, who excels under Popovich's side pick-and-roll action and spread out floor full of shooters. That's where Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard come into play. Signing Aldridge was huge, but retaining Green and Leonard, two of the premier perimeter defenders and corner 3-point shooters in the league, is equally significant. San Antonio now ensures itself of being competitive for at least another four years, and in addition will be buoyed by the 34-year-old former All-Star David West taking the veteran's minimum and turning down $10 million from Indiana. Frontcourt depth for the Spurs now goes from being a legitimate concern to a strength. WarriorsSometimes the best moves are the ones you don't make. In the case of Golden State, not reaching for a name was part one, and part two was retaining two hugely important assets in Mo Speights and Draymond Green. Green, an All-NBA First Team defender and a natural playmaking forward, will earn $85 million over the next five years. He will actually make more than MVP Stephen Curry, who signed a ""smallish"" four-year, $44 million deal before the 2013-14 season in the midst of his ankle woes. Green, at 25 years old, is the rare four-year collegian and second-round pick to turn from afterthought to bonafide star. Losing him would have been catastrophic because of his remarkable two-way versatility and winning characteristics.BucksSince when did Milwaukee become a free agent hot spot? After keeping their budding young star Khris Middleton -- albeit on a slightly robust five-year, $70 million extension -- GM John Hammond somehow convinced former Detroit power forward Greg Monroe to come on board for three years and $50 million, turning down the infamously bright lights of New York City. Monroe, as I recently highlighted, is a splendid passer and a downright workhorse who hasn't averaged fewer than 15.4 points and 9.3 rebounds over the past four seasons. And, because of his offensive nimbleness, he can allow scoring dynamo Jabari Parker to play both forward slots depending on the matchups and what suits Parker the best. Hey, if Zaza Pachulia can be effective from the elbows for coach Jason Kidd, then Monroe should thrive.The 23-year-old Middleton, at 6-foot-7, is a big-time scorer and dead-eye shooter (40 percent career from 3) who has also shown the propensity to guard multiple spots. Because of it, he blends nicely with another emerging star on the Bucks, folk hero favorite ""Greek Freak"" Giannis Antetokounmpo. All of this is great news for a Milwaukee team that ranked 25th in offense on a per-possession basis, the lowest mark of any playoff team. You have to retain your top-tier talent to consistently win in this league -- just look at the Spurs and Warriors -- and the Bucks acted swiftly and appropriately with Middleton.Reggie JacksonThe cap is expanding, so most of these contracts seem bloated, but Detroit just committed five years and $80 million to a shoot-first point guard whose career shooting percentages of 29 percent from 3 and 43 percent from the floor are only made scarier that he couldn't rack up consistent assist numbers playing with Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka in the wide-open Oklahoma City offense. Detroit couldn't retain Monroe and losing Reggie Jackson would have hurt a lot, but there were bargains at point guard in this market, including Houston's defensive stud Patrick Beverley, who will sign a reasonable four-year, $25 million extension with the Rockets. In other words, Jackson hit the lottery, and not the little one either. I'm talking about one of those big lotteries they have in cities you've never heard of.GrizzliesMemphis wins with grit and selfless team basketball on both ends. Brandan Wright hasn't exactly jumped onto your radar screen, but the Grizzlies newest power forward gives them both, along with a terrific pick-and-roll partner for Mike Conley. Plus, at three years and $18 million, he is precisely the type of bargain you're looking for after locking up Marc Gasol to a max deal. What's more is that he's a better player than Kosta Koufos, and a cheaper one too. The Grizz think they are close. The West is a constant grind and a battle of attrition. A lack of frontcourt depth is one way of making sure you don't contend and they just fixed a need.LOSERSBig-Market TeamsThe Bucks and Pelicans (resigning Anthony Davis) struck it big, while some of the league's wealthiest big market franchises continue to miss out. The Knicks couldn't lure Monroe or Aldridge -- let alone secure a meeting -- and the Lakers whiffed on Aldridge, Love and Monroe, while the Celtics thought they had a real shot at Love only to find out they didn't. What does this all mean? Maybe it's twofold: players feel like they don't need the lure of a major city to build their own brands off the court. Social media keeps everyone connected and seemingly on the same page. Perhaps more importantly, the massive leap in salary cap during the 2016-17 season means that everyone -- including the stingiest GMs -- can pony up the big bucks. Maybe the most pertinent question left is when exactly Jim Buss will finally retire from the Lakers and let someone with real basketball acumen take over as head of basketball operations?BlazersDamian Lillard is the only remaining starter from last year's playoff team. That's how dismal the summer has gone in Portland, who not only lost Aldridge, Robin Lopez and Wesley Matthews, but also dealt Nicolas Batum. To be fair, it retained an interesting former top-10 from Charlotte in 19-year-old Noah Vonleh and also picked up an ace rebounder in 26-year-old power forward Ed Davis, a former lottery pick himself. But giving $30 million over four years to Al-Farouq Aminu is hardly a consolation prize. As it stands, we know one thing for certain: the Blazers have effectively missed their title window. Lillard is a fine young triggerman, but this is now a roster bereft of high-level talent and athleticism. GM Neil Olshey's team now goes from a 50-win Western Conference club into the depths of next June's lottery. It's worth noting that a central component of that is the litany of poor free agency moves by Olshey in years past, a list highlighted by Dorell Wright, Joel Freeland and Chris Kaman.Chris Paul/ClippersDeAndre Jordan leaving was a monumental blow for a team that loves to run and relies on its bigs to finish at the rim. Jordan was not an offensive weapon, but he finished everything around the rim (league-leading 71 percent field goal percentage) and covered up Blake Griffin's defensive flaws. The Clippers' epic postseason collapse against Houston wasn't necessarily the impetus either. Rumors of dissension between Jordan and Chris Paul have long plagued the relationship. For all of Paul's greatness, what's worse is a patterned history of incessant whining, lack of leadership and worst of all, inability to find playoff success. Not once during his brilliant 10-year career has Paul reached a conference final. With his nemesis now in Dallas, we shouldn't expect that streak to change anytime soon either. KingsLet's head up to the California state capital to a Kings franchise in utter disarray. He may not have had an outstanding rookie campaign, but former lottery pick Nik Stauskas appeared to be the shooting guard of the future in Sacramento last summer. Instead, the team sent him packing to Philadelphia, along with a 2018 protected first-round pick and the option to swap 2016 and 2017 first-rounders for two second-round draft choices whose names I can't even pronounce. As if that weren't bad enough, Sacramento will spend $10 million on a one-year deal for point guard Rajon Rondo when the market clearly showed he wasn't even worth a third of that. Rondo, after all, is coming off a season in which he shot 33 percent from the line in Boston, who then dealt him to Dallas where he ""improved"" to 45 percent. His best basketball is clearly firmly in the rearview mirror and yet, he's going to make more money than Conley, and nearly as much as MVP Curry and All-Star Kyle Lowry. Meanwhile, lost amid all this drama is a looming disaster with DeMarcus Cousins, the team's best asset and one of the dominant young bigs in the league today. Here's a thought: George Karl is a 64-year-old coach who's never won a title and feuded his way through a laundry list of great players. Cousins is a 24-year-old franchise cornerstone for the next decade. If this is going to turn around, Karl needs to stop acting like a petulant child and mend his tarnished relationship with Cousins. Like I said, something is very, very wrong in Sacramento.

On Tuesday's episode of ""The View,"" the co-host expressed her opinion by saying that she didn't want to make any judgments about the comedian because ""he has not been proven a rapist."" The Academy Award-winning actress, who jokingly referred to herself as ""a former quaalude user"" elaborated, “I don’t like snap judgments because I’ve had snap judgments made on me, so I’m very, very careful. Save your texts. Save your nasty comments. I don’t care.”She continued, “I say this because this is my opinion, and in America, still, I know it’s a shock, but you are still innocent until proven guilty … He has not been proven a rapist.”Goldberg also joked, ""The '80s weren't fun for everyone."" Co-host Raven-Symoné, who noted Cosby ""gave me my first job,"" admitted it was hard to talk about him. ""I don't really like to discuss [this] because he is the reason I am on this panel in the first place,” she said, adding, “You need proof, and then I will be able to give my judgment here or there.”The episode aired just a day after newly released court documents revealed Cosby had admitted to purchasing drugs (quaaludes) and giving them to women before having sex with them. The revelation caused singer Jill Scott to withdraw her support for Cosby. You can watch the entire clip over at Jezebel. To subscribe to our HuffPost Entertainment WhatsApp account:1.

Tillman, who was a South Carolina governor and U.S. Senator, was racist and openly advocated for killing black men. He proudly boasted about a militia he was involved with having executed state Sen. Simon Coker, a black Republican, in 1876. Another spraypainted message found on Tillman Hall this week said ""R.I.P. Sen. Coker.""Students and faculty have long-called for Clemson to rename the building. Some professors renewed their efforts last week following the June killing of nine at an historically black church in Charleston.South Carolina's Heritage Act prevents the university from renaming the building without a super majority approval from the state legislature. Clemson's president and trustees have supported removing the Confederate battle flag from the state Capitol, but not for pushing to rename Tillman Hall. Clemson's trustees did not return requests for comment from The Huffington Post this week. University police also found graffiti on the building stating, ""Blacks must remain subordinate or be exterminated -- Tillman,"" according to an incident report obtained by HuffPost."
17,SPORTS,Datone Jones Bought Some Marijuana Just Hours After NFC Championship Loss,Justin Block,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/datone-jones-marijuana_us_559bf23ae4b04a9c98e83204,The offseason is smoking season for a lot of NFL players.,2015-07-07,NFC Championship - Green Bay Packers v Seattle Seahawks,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559199512d0000b8a8daa95f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Just seven hours after the Green Bay Packers lost a heartbreaker to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship game on Jan. 18, defensive end Datone Jones already had ideas to pack his own kind of green. Jones was cited by police for marijuana possession at 12:29 a.m. the morning after the game, just hours after the Packers' plane returned to Green Bay following the loss, the Green Bay Press-Gazette reported on Monday. Green Bay Police said they responded to a call reporting suspicious activity in a black Jeep at an apartment complex parking lot on the west side of the city. The caller reported seeing money and a sandwich bag exchange hands. Two officers investigated the Jeep and smelled marijuana. When confronted by officers, Jones, according to a police report, ""became emotionally upset, and told officers he was the first-round draft pick of the Green Bay Packers.""The classic ""Do you know who I am?"" card -- see: Witherspoon, Reese -- didn't work on the Packers' hometown cops. Jones was issued a citation at the scene, convicted on Feb. 10 and has since paid an $880 fine. The NFL followed up the conviction last Thursday by suspending Jones for the season opener against the Chicago Bears for violating the league's substance-abuse policy. Three players (including Jones' teammate on the Packers' defensive line, Letroy Guion) have been cited or arrested for marijuana possession since season's end. These run-ins with the law have occurred during a time when use of the drug is rampant throughout the league. By some estimates, the majority of the NFL's players are frequent marijuana users, using it as a ""safer"" alternative to prescription pain killers. Under the current NFL drug policy, it's quite easy for players to get away with smoking marijuana, players themselves admit. ""You know when the test is,"" one player recently told Bleacher Report's Mike Freeman. ""Once you pass it, you can do as much as you want all year."" Can we blame Jones for getting a quick start to the offseason following a crushing loss? Hardly. But he'd do well to avoid cliches. Scoring in a parking lot is so high school stoner flick. "
