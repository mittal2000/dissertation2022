A murky river of uncertain depth left the doorstep of my destination, the African Artists' Foundation (AAF), nine feet out of reach. After pacing up and down the dusty Lagos road, a single plywood plank strewn across the moat seemed precarious at best. Already late due to a ""go slow,"" a local term for the incessant traffic, I left my gear with my driver, swallowed my fear of heights and baby-stepped my way across wobbling wood.  Entrance to Nigeria's African Artists' Foundation. Also home to LagosPhoto, images from around the globe adorn interior and exterior walls.  All images © Ruthie Abel 2014AAF was a first stop in a ten-day foray into Nigerian contemporary art. The trip focused on Lagos, Africa's most populous city (estimated 21 million people, outpacing Cairo) and the center of contemporary creativity in Nigeria. A sprawling port on the Atlantic, Lagos is hundreds of miles south of the regions where over 200 schoolgirls remain kidnapped and the sites of the most recent Boko Haram bombings. While somewhat distanced from the country's worst violence, with daily power cuts and nearly half of the population living below the national poverty line, Lagos is by no means a simple place to make or experience art.  Laundry and satellite dishes spill onto the Lagos international airport runway. Burgeoning population density and paltry infrastructure makes searching for art venues a needle-in-haystack expedition. © Ruthie Abel 2014There are no art museums in Nigeria. A handful of overstocked gallerias and arts organizations are the only publicly accessible venues dedicated to viewing art. Typically adjacent to a hotel or restaurant or tucked into a residential complex, arts spaces are challenging to locate, climate-controlled environments are non-existent and works are tormented in turns by dust storms and excessive humidity. Yet there are gems to be found. Treacherous construction on AAF's doorstep conceals exhibition and workshop space as well as guest rooms and a lounge frequented by local and visiting artists, curators and writers. A mix of 20 and 30-something ex-pats and repatriated Nigerians (educated abroad, back with start-up vigor) occupy a handful of guest rooms. AAF hosts Nigeria's annual National Art Competition but the space is also home to the international Lagos Photo Festival. Similarly hidden on a couple of floors of an unmarked building, the Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) includes exhibition space and a library.  Detail of ""El Anatsui: Playing with Chance,"" a CAA installation that includes the Nigeria-based Ghanaian artist's correspondence with curators, collectors and assistants. Perhaps most renowned for massive liquor bottle top sculptural hangings, Anatsui is a patriarch of West African contemporary art and has been working with discarded objects for half a century. Shows at CAA and AAF led to studio visits, windows into how local creatives rise above environmental challenges. Below are images and excerpts from time with four artists, beginning with Obinna Makata, an alum of Anatsui's seminar at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka and a recent artist in residence at CAA.  My parents are civil servants, but they supported me becoming an artist. They didn't have money to give me to set up a studio but their advice and encouragement was worth more -- I am lucky. - Obinna Makata © Ruthie Abel 2014With Obinna Makata in his Lagos studio: RA: Let's talk about the fabrics in your work.   OM:  My first breakthrough as an artist was when I was so down. In 2011 I could hardly feed myself. I couldn't afford to buy materials, only pen and ink. I was just trying to keep myself busy. I had a neighbor who was a tailor and I saw scraps of fabric and thought ""let me just attach it,"" and that's how my style began. The director of AAF saw my work in a small craft shop. I tried to explain, it wasn't even work, it was just my frustration. He made me stay with it. Five of the works at Art Twenty One sold before (a recent show) opened.  If I want to lift my spirits, I play Bob Marley. For something more subtle or romantic, Gregory Isaacs or Eric Donaldson. But Marley is just the best. - Obinna Makata © Ruthie Abel 2014RA: What are you working on now?OM:  I have been working on issues of identity and the loss of culture of African society. Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is a classic book on how Europeans invaded Africa and imposed their way of life. Thirty years later, things keep falling apart. When I came here for my residency I met artists from other parts of the world and I realized that loss of culture is not particular only to Africa. So I shifted my research to an issue that the cause and effect is African: excessive acquisition of material things and the implications of consuming without producing or investing money in the proper way. There are a lot of crimes -- kidnapping and prostitution and things that make money fast. There's a trend in Nigeria now that almost all of the governors have private jets. This is money that is supposed to build infrastructure. Everything boils down to materialism and consumerism. I am using the Lagos fashion industry as a case study. Everyone is so fashion-conscious. RA:  And fabric is a metaphor for fashion?OM: Most of these fabrics, the color and motif are African. But 80% are printed in Holland. Nigeria is one of the world's highest producers of crude oil. But we have no refineries, we rely on the west to refine it and sell it back to us. A lot of artists preach about social issues and corruption, but Uche (Uzorka) actually lives what he preaches and his life is his work. - Makata on Uzorka (pictured) © Ruthie Abel 2014With Uche Uzorka in his Lagos studio: RA: How does your day begin?UU: I wake and first thing, I hit the canvas and start cutting paper. I get consumed in the process, because for me that's joy.RA: Those truck horns are deafening -- does the noise outside affect you?   UU: There's a lot of traffic on this road, always chaos. When I first came (to Lagos), I couldn't contain the noise. It was too loud, people talking too fast, too aggressive. But I began to imbibe all of that noise and transmit it to my canvas... I am wondering where to find a balance. I am standing between the canvas and the street and they are both noisy. RA: What do you like to do outside of the studio?UU: Around 5 or 6 o'clock I may go out and watch football. I find myself supporting Chelsea Football Club. You get hypnotized. Every game statistic is given to you and it is difficult to get your brain away.  I studied architecture because my dad didn't understand what art was about and he thought, 'There's no money to be made, it's a life of frustration, you're female, you should have a job that will make men want to marry you.' - Peju Alatise © Ruthie Abel 2014With Peju Alatise, in her Lagos home studio:RA: When did you transition your practice from architecture to art?PA: For a while, I was torn between my architecture practice, design work, painting, sculpting and telling stories. It was like cooking with all of the condiments at the same time. My paintings look like sculptures and my sculptures look like paintings and they all have this long story about them and sometimes I design pieces that come with usable furniture pieces. I lacked editing in my work because I wanted to show everything in it. I wanted it to be a mini-me. RA: What are you working on now?PA: I took March off from the studio to write my third book. I went to South Africa and thought I would continue (in Lagos) but there's no electricity and the heat is driving me mad. I will go anywhere there's electricity! There has been a total blackout here for three months. Once in a while there's electricity for 15-30 minutes. The queue (for generator fuel) probably takes 4 hours, you get back home with a headache that radiates down to your shoulders and armpits. You want to type but you can't think straight. You don't get anything here without a fight. There are certain people who make sure we don't have electricity, they are the .0001%. These are people who own the government. They just sit there and rape the country of all of its resources. - Peju Alatise © Ruthie Abel 2014RA: How was your residency in Essaouira?PA: Funny enough, the way I feel about Nigeria is exactly how Moroccans talked about their government. They are hard on their government but they stay because Africa is this gem of a place.  Back in the day, in rural areas, you couldn't practice as an artist if you were a woman. It was unheard of. The male artists used to get Nike arrested. She broke glass ceilings for women like myself, who were born, raised, schooled and practicing in Nigeria. She was someone that gave me courage, that as a woman, the sky's the limit. She gave us permission to aim high. - Peju Alatise on Nike Davies Okundaye (pictured) © Ruthie Abel 2014With Chief Nike Davies Okundaye, in Lagos and via telephone:RA: You lost your mom at age 6, fled an arranged marriage at 13, survived 16 years with an abusive polygamist husband, mastered and preserved adire (traditional indigo dying). Your work is in the Smithsonian Museum and you operate Nigeria's largest art gallery as well as craft workshops in Osogbo and Lagos that double as safe havens for women and girls. Does anything hold you back? NDO: I was never afraid of anything except politics. I never used to vote.Politics in Nigeria is a dirty game. People are short-minded, always jealous of what women do. They will say, ""Look at that woman, go and burn her house.' And then all you have worked for is gone. RA:  What made you decide to vote in elections?NDO: I went to South Africa seven years ago. It was (a conference) organized by Clinton's wife, ""Vital Voices"", so women all over the world will have a voice. If they cheat me, all the other women will fight (for me). After the conference, we went to Fashola, the governor of Lagos state, and told him to put women in the cabinet. Now there are women in key positions, and the same in Ashun state. This conference made me want to vote, I voted for the first time. RA: I understand you begin work before dawn. Will you take a break for the holidays?NDO: All my artists come to eat Christmas dinner with me in Lagos. And I am going to Igidi for New Year's. I will make candied yam -- it makes everyone happy. In the village, people like python and monkey and bush meat for holidays. Because of Ebola now they said no more bush meat, but some people still eat it. I won't have it -- we are so scared. I will cook catfish and 'cow with a feather'. That's what people call chicken!  We don't have snow but we wear white for purity, and indigo for love... Odun titun! Happy New Year! - Nike Davies Okundaye © Ruthie Abel 2014"

RA:  And fabric is a metaphor for fashion?OM: Most of these fabrics, the color and motif are African. But 80% are printed in Holland. Nigeria is one of the world's highest producers of crude oil. But we have no refineries, we rely on the west to refine it and sell it back to us. A lot of artists preach about social issues and corruption, but Uche (Uzorka) actually lives what he preaches and his life is his work. - Makata on Uzorka (pictured) © Ruthie Abel 2014With Uche Uzorka in his Lagos studio: RA: How does your day begin?UU: I wake and first thing, I hit the canvas and start cutting paper. I get consumed in the process, because for me that's joy.RA: Those truck horns are deafening -- does the noise outside affect you?   UU: There's a lot of traffic on this road, always chaos. When I first came (to Lagos), I couldn't contain the noise. It was too loud, people talking too fast, too aggressive. But I began to imbibe all of that noise and transmit it to my canvas... I am wondering where to find a balance. I am standing between the canvas and the street and they are both noisy. RA: What do you like to do outside of the studio?UU: Around 5 or 6 o'clock I may go out and watch football. I find myself supporting Chelsea Football Club. You get hypnotized. Every game statistic is given to you and it is difficult to get your brain away.  I studied architecture because my dad didn't understand what art was about and he thought, 'There's no money to be made, it's a life of frustration, you're female, you should have a job that will make men want to marry you.' - Peju Alatise © Ruthie Abel 2014With Peju Alatise, in her Lagos home studio:RA: When did you transition your practice from architecture to art?PA: For a while, I was torn between my architecture practice, design work, painting, sculpting and telling stories. It was like cooking with all of the condiments at the same time. My paintings look like sculptures and my sculptures look like paintings and they all have this long story about them and sometimes I design pieces that come with usable furniture pieces. I lacked editing in my work because I wanted to show everything in it. I wanted it to be a mini-me. RA: What are you working on now?PA: I took March off from the studio to write my third book. I went to South Africa and thought I would continue (in Lagos) but there's no electricity and the heat is driving me mad. I will go anywhere there's electricity! There has been a total blackout here for three months. Once in a while there's electricity for 15-30 minutes. The queue (for generator fuel) probably takes 4 hours, you get back home with a headache that radiates down to your shoulders and armpits. You want to type but you can't think straight. You don't get anything here without a fight. There are certain people who make sure we don't have electricity, they are the .0001%. These are people who own the government. They just sit there and rape the country of all of its resources. - Peju Alatise © Ruthie Abel 2014RA: How was your residency in Essaouira?PA: Funny enough, the way I feel about Nigeria is exactly how Moroccans talked about their government. They are hard on their government but they stay because Africa is this gem of a place.  Back in the day, in rural areas, you couldn't practice as an artist if you were a woman. It was unheard of. The male artists used to get Nike arrested. She broke glass ceilings for women like myself, who were born, raised, schooled and practicing in Nigeria. She was someone that gave me courage, that as a woman, the sky's the limit. She gave us permission to aim high. - Peju Alatise on Nike Davies Okundaye (pictured) © Ruthie Abel 2014With Chief Nike Davies Okundaye, in Lagos and via telephone:RA: You lost your mom at age 6, fled an arranged marriage at 13, survived 16 years with an abusive polygamist husband, mastered and preserved adire (traditional indigo dying). Your work is in the Smithsonian Museum and you operate Nigeria's largest art gallery as well as craft workshops in Osogbo and Lagos that double as safe havens for women and girls. Does anything hold you back? NDO: I was never afraid of anything except politics. I never used to vote.Politics in Nigeria is a dirty game. People are short-minded, always jealous of what women do. They will say, ""Look at that woman, go and burn her house.' And then all you have worked for is gone. RA:  What made you decide to vote in elections?NDO: I went to South Africa seven years ago. It was (a conference) organized by Clinton's wife, ""Vital Voices"", so women all over the world will have a voice. If they cheat me, all the other women will fight (for me). After the conference, we went to Fashola, the governor of Lagos state, and told him to put women in the cabinet. Now there are women in key positions, and the same in Ashun state. This conference made me want to vote, I voted for the first time. RA: I understand you begin work before dawn. Will you take a break for the holidays?NDO: All my artists come to eat Christmas dinner with me in Lagos. And I am going to Igidi for New Year's. I will make candied yam -- it makes everyone happy. In the village, people like python and monkey and bush meat for holidays. Because of Ebola now they said no more bush meat, but some people still eat it. I won't have it -- we are so scared. I will cook catfish and 'cow with a feather'. That's what people call chicken!  We don't have snow but we wear white for purity, and indigo for love... Odun titun! Happy New Year! - Nike Davies Okundaye © Ruthie Abel 2014"

After such salvos and perhaps taking cover behind them, even President Barack Obama joined the chorus and called Sony's decision to pull the movie a ""mistake.""The good news on Tuesday afternoon from Sony Pictures does not, however, end the fight. Not in the least.Now it is time for two more very important things to happen.First, the major theater chains that control oodles and oodles of screens that trade in the free-speech products that are motion pictures must show the movie. The Interview's silver screen distribution must not be limited to those independent movie houses with the spine and courage to show it.Second, Americans must turn out to see it on Christmas day. After unwrapping presents, we need to get in cars and drive to those few theaters that show the movie and see it. This is no time for the comfort of watching movies at home on Netflix.We must take this second step -- we must match Sony's cojones, as it were -- because we owe it to ourselves and, more importantly, to the principle of free speech. The price of a movie ticket is a small price to pay for freedom of expression. And finally, while we are on the topic of free expression and to put a simple trip to the movies in to perspective, let's please not forget the American journalists like James Foley who died for the First Amendment in 2014. It is highly doubtful, however, that the major corporations that run the movie theaters will demonstrate the same courage as Foley who sacrificed his life attempting to inform Americans about the evil perpetrated by some nations. Note to theater chains -- in your case, that means North Korea.May the year 2015 be a much better one for free speech."

Attending the theater together is holiday tradition for us, and I couldn't wait to see how the popular 1983 film had been transformed into a stage musical. Unfortunately, I'd forgotten somehow that the comedy, set in 1940s Indiana, revolves around a 9-year-old's boy's desperate attempts to persuade his parents to buy him a BB gun for Christmas. As I sat in the audience that night, watching the young actor portraying Ralphie bounce all over the stage, extolling the virtues of the ""Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model Air Rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time,"" I couldn't help but think about Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old black boy shot dead on November 22 by Cleveland police with an AirSoft BB gun in his hands. I also found myself repeatedly turning away from the action on the stage to glance down the aisle at my own 12-year-old black son.We've never bought my son or his two sisters toy guns, and yet we've amassed a cache of Nerf blasters, rubber band rifles, water guns and more, all unwelcome gifts from friends and relatives. Of course, I could choose to confiscate incoming weapons like some parents do, but I know for most kids, pretend gun play is more about feeling powerful within themselves versus a desire to wage violence against others. Also, I well know that kids don't need toy guns in order to shoot. A few years ago, when I visited an orphanage in South India, a group of laughing, preschool-aged girls and boys surrounded me in a hallway, shouting, ""Pistol! Pistol!"" with their tiny hands twisted into gun shapes drawn straight at my head. The nun in charge told me they'd learned it from watching TV.In A Christmas Story, young Ralphie's desperate desire for a gun is all about feeling powerful. He imagines the gun as a talisman that will turn him into a hero, allowing him to save his teacher and classmates from an old-fashioned villain in a black hat. Owning a gun is also a way for Ralphie feel close to his father, to join the tribe of men. A Christmas Story strikes me as a microcosm of America's romantic fascination with guns, which may be why in 2012 the National Film Registry chose to preserve the movie version for its cultural and historical significance. Ralphie's adventures in the fictional town of Hohman echo my late father's idyllic tales of growing up in tiny Newfield, New York, in the late 1940s and early 50s, where he trudged to school in the snow, rode horses through the woods and used the rifle my grandfather gave him to shoot wildly at trees, squirrels and possibly his younger brother. My dad cherished that rifle as a symbol of an exuberant boyhood -- so much so that he hung onto it, and I got a terrible scare the day my son, at about age 7, found the rifle, unloaded, in a closet at grandpa's house. My dad shrugged off my panic at the time, for in his mind, boys and guns belonged together, with just a little light supervision needed.Like Ralphie and almost everyone else in A Christmas Story, my father was white. My husband and I are white too. As parents by adoption, we are struggling to prepare our three kids of color to live in a racially-complex society that excludes people like them from most quintessentially American tales and instead burdens them with far uglier narratives. A black parent who gives a 12-year-old a toy gun is irresponsible. A black boy who just wants to feel powerful and waves a toy gun in the park is a threat. A black man with a gun is not a hero, but a thug.A couple of months before Tamir Rice died with an Airsoft gun in his hand, I stopped my son and a black friend as they were headed out our back door to meet a classmate at the park, loaded down with Nerf guns. ""Guys,"" I said, ""you can't go outside with those."" My son and his friend didn't argue with me, the way 12-year-olds usually do. Instead, both just stopped and seemed to visibly deflate. I didn't have to say anything else, because I'd reminded them of the story they can't afford to forget. Without a word, the boys put their toy guns away and walked out into the street, alone and unarmed."

I've loved this Stephen Sondheim musical since I was twelve. And yet something about the lavish-looking film adaptation gives me pause: the all-star cast is all white. All. White. Half of my family members with whom I'll be watching the movie have brown skin, and though they are all eager to see fairy tale characters who are familiar to them, played by sparkly actors who are also familiar to them, no one on the big screen will look like them. This is something they are used to and have always been. And that is too bad.Also too bad is the feeling that I'm not sure I'll be brave enough to bring this up during our holiday movie night. I mean, who wants to risk being ""Debbie Downer"" on Christmas? I'm sure I'm not alone here -- in my ambivalence about the film, or in my hesitation to bring it up.But what better time to address racism, and the ill-effects of unchecked systems of power and privilege, than when we are seated comfortably in our bubbles of power and privilege? A time during which we celebrate fantastic images of who we are -- or at least who we dream ourselves to be -- projected onto an enormous screen? Yes, we risk sobering up the party for a sec, but we just might also inspire each other to think. To discuss. And to become aware of how even the most subtle forms of bias get absorbed into all of our heads and impact all of our behaviors -- behaviors that range from telling jokes based on prejudice, to more explicit forms of discrimination, to horrific acts of violence.Following the grand jury decisions in the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases, we as a country have expressed more reactions, opinions, theories and curiosities about race, injustice and our systemic failures to protect all of our people, than perhaps ever before. Dialogue of this kind is crucial to foster necessary changes to our systems, but by the time our people are murdered unjustly it is too late to make effective changes. There is little we can do at that point but grieve, mourn, be outraged and cast blame. Our observations about racial inequality might be more effective when we are not in states of trauma and grief, and instead when we are celebrating our powers and privileges with our families -- especially those members of our families who are white, or have an abundance of social advantages, or for whom social injustice may not blip on the radar until someone is brutally, unjustifiably murdered. Now I don't mean to suggest that problems of systemic racism can be solved in a movie theater. But I do think that sharing observations about the casting of our movies is a great place to start. Especially for those of us who want to stop contributing to the problem and instead take a meaningful step toward healing and change. After all, movies are our dreams, and the images we see on screen impact how we think and how we behave. According to SAG AFTRA, the union representing all on-screen performers in America, ""There is no other medium as capable of affecting human behavior and thought as films."" We as audiences can be more aware of the faces we see on screen and demand to see more faces that reflect us, our families and friends, and the American scene as it truly is, and as we dream it to be.This is especially true of our fantasy films, like Into the Woods, which represent the farthest reaches of our dreamiest dreams and have more room than most for diverse casting possibilities. Let's ask ourselves: would it really damage the story if the Witch or Cinderella was a person of color? The talent certainly exists. We could all benefit from seeing the magnificent performances of six-time Tony award-winner Audra MacDonald or Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson on our big screens. (Of course, some people would inevitably disagree with this observation. I wrote about this topic two years ago when the first Hobbit film came out, featuring an entirely white cast, and I received angry emails from Tolkien ""experts"" for weeks. These self-styled fantasy wonks ranged from those of the white supremacist variety to liberal-minded friends of mine -- all of whom were white, and male -- who shared elaborate explanations for why all of the cast members ""needed"" to be white, and why such a need was absolutely not racist logic. I wonder now if the Cinderella ""experts"" will react to this post with thorough explanations of the casting choices made for Into the Woods.)But I digress. The point is that, in most cases, casting with diversity in mind does not compromise storytelling. In many cases it enhances it. It also provides audiences opportunities for identifying and empathizing with a greater variety of people, with a greater variety of faces and histories, than we are currently allowed. We can demand more of this in our entertainment. Fairy tales are not the only opportunities to cast actors of color, as Sony Studios is currently proving with their remake of Annie. Apparently producers can cast a black actor in the role of an iconic white comic book character -- when they are not sitting around sending reductive emails about whether Obama likes ""black"" movies -- and it can work. (I have not yet heard the Annie ""experts"" threaten to picket screenings of the film.) Think of the great effect such a casting choice will have on all the girls and boys across America who will see a character on screen who looks like them. And while we're on the subject of movie producers, they could all benefit by taking a page from the great American theater director Liesl Tommy, who constantly finds innovative ways to put actors of all shapes, colors and sizes on stage to great effect. Her inspired casting choices serve the stories she tells, emphasizing their relevance to modern audiences and expanding everyone's palette of people with whom to identify. Her contemporized production of Les Miserables at the Dallas Theater Center, for example, featured a diverse cast and garnered rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. But let's get back to the children. The musical Into the Woods leaves its audience with a song called ""Children Will Listen."" Here are some of the lyrics:Careful the things you say Children will listen Careful the things you do Children will see and learnThe children I will watch the movie with this week will see a fairy tale about white people. What will they learn? I suppose that depends on whether or not people like me choose to say something about it. *This blog post first appeared on Mark O'Connell, LCSW's Psychology Today column, Quite Queerly."

The Ocean Queen Express, which was rebuilt after the tsunami, has become a symbol of the disaster in Sri Lanka and was at the centre of commemorations for the country's 31,000 victims. Survivors and relatives of the dead boarded the train December 26 morning in Colombo and headed to Peraliya, the exact spot where it was ripped from the tracks, around 90 kilometres (56 miles) south of Colombo.

KODIKARA (Photo credit should read Ishara S.KODIKARA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d29f2100006401c75515.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"December 26, 2004, Galle, Sri Lanka: When we first saw the destruction, we could hardly believe our eyes. The wave hit three times, like a wash, rinse and tumble cycle. Houses were completely swept away, and almost everywhere we looked, all we could see was rubble piled on top of concrete foundations. People set up tents on top of the foundations to claim the spots where their homes once stood. But it was not just the devastation that was so incredible, it was immense scale -- the totality of the shoreline that had been affected. It was completely unimaginable -- miles and miles of boats strewn along the sides of the road where 80 percent of the country's trade and tourism used to stand. Here was a world turned literally upside down right across the street from completely flattened neighborhoods. Almost everywhere we looked, there was nothing left -- only people standing, staring, shocked. On a clear December morning ten years ago, when the sky was again a deep, gorgeous blue -- just like September 11th -- one brief unexpected event became a seminal moment in history. It was the largest natural disaster of our lives. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami killed more than 35,000 people in Sri Lanka, injuring more than 21,000. Over 1,000 children were orphaned and more than 7,000 children lost one parent. Tens of thousands of children lost siblings and friends in the hour the waves engulfed the shoreline. In all the countries hit by the tsunami, the death toll was a staggering 227,898. The loss of human lives was 80 times more than the World Trade Center attack. When our team first arrived in Sri Lanka, the stench of human corpses still under the rubble made us choke. We learned that before the first wave hit, the sea pulled away, extending the beach and shoreline out as far as half a mile. Curious villagers wandered out on the newly exposed rocks to pick up fish trapped in newly formed tide pools. Laughing children came racing from their homes to see the strange new edge of the shore or to collect the many shells ready for the taking. Before 10 minutes passed, a 30 foot brown wall of water appeared out of nowhere, roaring so loud and coming so fast that few could escape its force. Others who lost their lives didn't expect a second or third wave and ran down to the shore to try to save their boats or simply stand in awe at the barren rocks which had revealed themselves. The tsunami traveled at speeds estimated at up to 500 miles per hour, crashing into the shoreline and engulfing everyone and everything. As the tide reversed, it dragged cars, boulders, printing presses, refrigerators, buses and bicycles along with thousands of people and tons of raw sewage. Many people died when debris crashed into them as they struggled to get out of the water. People caught in cars tried desperately to push open doors held shut by the force of the water. Dozens were killed in buses; 1,700 were trapped in a train that was tumbled by the first wave and its merciless return. The train track all along the coast would need to be completely rebuilt.The waves washed away people's identities, their driver's licenses, birth certificates, bank statements, clothing, prayer books, shoes, photo albums, land records and money. Nearly a fifth of Sri Lanka's government regional offices were destroyed, and hundreds of local officials in almost every coastal town or village perished. Fishing boats, bicycles, cars, pushcarts and wheelchairs disappeared. Shoe stores, tailors, hardware stores, plumbing suppliers, pharmacies, gift shops, auto body shops, printers and newsstands vanished in a matter of minutes. The 2004 tsunami had an eerie finality to it -- you either died or you didn't. There were relatively few serious physical injuries, although many died in the days after the event from sepsis. After swimming in sewage, the patient's wounds were cleaned and stitched shut and then they were sent away without antibiotics. The local doctors didn't know. Some lost limbs to save their lives, the amputations virtually all done without anesthesia. Nothing we saw on television on the morning of December 26th before leaving the U.S. gave us even a hint of the reality of what happened in Sri Lanka. One Washington Post journalist we met there who had covered every major disaster over the past 15 years agreed. He told us that the Iran earthquake a year earlier, midwestern tornadoes, war-torn African nations, genocide and even Iraq diminished in his memory when he arrived in Sri Lanka. That, he said, was his new worst-case scenario, the deepest loss and suffering he'd ever seen. And although many of the mosques and practically all of the Buddhas miraculously survived, we wondered if a sign we saw foretold the truth. It said: ""This is the beginning of the end of the world.""Our team first went to Galle, high on the forty-foot walls of the Forte, where hundreds of villagers threw ropes over the edge of the wall trying to save those in the water. Not a single person was able to grab hold and be rescued. We would later grieve with children who tried to save their friends or parents.Everyone who witnessed the wave that day in Sri Lanka, whether six years old or sixty, experienced a traumatic event so profound that it wounded their psyche, making an indelible mark on their soul. We knew that many children would face the effects of post traumatic stress; most would find coping mechanisms and return to normal but 8-10 percent would be unable to rid themselves of deeply repressed emotions which would become PTSD. Without any intervention or support, the experience of this disaster could severely tax the Sri Lankan health care system and impact entire families and communities over a wide swath of the small island nation.Ironically, one fortunate blessing that emerged from this tsunami was Second Response, the initiative that has since deployed teams following many other natural disasters. Its primary goal is building capacity on the ground for caregivers who can reduce the number of cases of PTSD among children in impacted areas. Sri Lanka served as the first opportunity to introduce the methodology we now call ""PLAYshops"" to teams from disaster organizations that came to Sri Lanka.PLAYshops were created in response to the lack of effective, transcultural, secondary prevention methods specifically addressing the needs of children in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event. In Sri Lanka, we experienced first-hand how quickly children's emotional needs are subjugated after a disaster and we soon recognized the gap in services between first responders and the reconstruction phase that would come much later. Very few on the ground were equipped to heal the unaddressed internal landscape of those affected, particularly children, in the weeks after the tsunami. Then and there, we pledged to share our methodology and caregiver's guide in order to mitigate the symptoms of PTS before it become the full blown disorder, PTSD. Our Second Response methodology and protocols have proven to be a significant component in reducing the impact of PTSD after disasters in children who have benefitted from our trainings worldwide. We do this by teaching carefully crafted ""play"", somatic-based exercises, and improvised, creative physical expression. Within 90-120 days after a traumatic event -- during relief efforts and prior to the community's reconstruction phase - Second Response Trauma Teams work with children who have been affected. It is known that 8-10 percent of children cannot readjust using only natural coping mechanisms and therefore suffer long-term consequences also impacting the communities in which they live. Since 2004 in Sri Lanka, we've been active throughout the world in places as remote as Java, Samoa, Japan and the Philippines and closer to home in the Northeast United States following various weather events. Over this time, we reduced the impact of PTSD in nearly 100,000 children and trained caregivers on the ground from medical schools, emergency managers, (CERT) Community Emergency Response Teams, parents, teachers and a variety of staff and volunteers from disaster relief organizations including the Red Cross, Mercy Corps, Save the Children, World Vision and Hope International.We travel to areas most severely impacted and provide body-centered interventions, with two goals:  • Reduce the PTS that exists in the affected population after a disaster and prevent the onset of full-blown PTSD.• Build on-the-ground capacity that is both cost-effective and easily replicated through pre-emptive training of local providers before a disaster strikes. Since those life-changing days in 2004, members of our team have returned to Sri Lanka nine times and have continued to train local caregivers and build capacity to meet future events with additional, effective skills. We have learned a lot about the cost saving preventative measures similar to those that PLAYshops trainings can provide. One study concluded that interventions within 3 weeks of the onset of an event could cost as little as $5,000 but beyond that date costs can easily rise to $200,000. Untreated PTSD is likely to persist and cause further negative health effects like drug or alcohol abuse, chronic pain, depression, sleep issues, and the inability to interact socially at school as well as preventable illnesses like respiratory ailments, digestive disorders and skin conditions. Our continued vision is that one day all disaster relief organizations worldwide will have an additional skill at their disposal -- one that can reduce and prevent PTSD so that children can more easily recover their natural experience of joy, laughter and play -- even after a life-changing event like the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004."

The bold, red sign on the putty-colored building -- TARGET -- hovered over the jet black parking lot, a paradise of concrete, its stateliness heightened by manicured patches of grass. By the main doors, two shop girls picked up garbage and deposited it in an overflowing bin, an avalanche of trash. The store was still empty of customers, but it was buzzing inside like an awakening beehive. Emily glanced through the crystal clear glass doors and saw more assistants rushing around, their arms filled with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes DVDs and bright pink molded cup brassieres. There was a general unpacking amid an apparent confusion of materials being scrutinized, turned over and marked in the midst of a glorious universe.""Oh!"" she exclaimed. ""Take a look at that!""Signs announced ""Your One Stop for Flu Shots,"" holiday store hours and ""We're Hiring!"" Red shopping carts adorned with bulls-eyes formed triumphal lines, waiting for eager hands to clasp their handlebars and lead them forward, through the automatic doors and across the threshold into a new world. The Target was so exquisite that it brought a lump to Emily's throat, and she was left standing, shaking, engrossed, forgetting everything else. The most delicate colors radiated from all around her. At once enchanted and disturbed by this loveliness, she stood and admired it, rooted to the spot, waiting.More automobiles arrived, hordes of them, pulling into parking spots, and out of these automobiles poured middle-aged blonde ladies in slacks and patterned blouses, carrying sensible handbags. Although there was no church clock in this parking lot, if there had been, it would have sounded eight for the office workers on their way to work and the housewives shopping. And then suddenly, the spotless glass doors were unlocked, like opening the gates to a heavenly kingdom of delight, and Emily walked inside, passing over the slightly dirty carpet, passing the Starbucks and its advertisements for spiced holiday coffee drinks. She looked over the departments and let out a sigh, wondering where to begin and how to conquer this wondrous expanse of sales. Next to her, red baskets with gray handles were nestled in stacks, their gaping voids gasping to be filled with objects.It was a temple to the extravagant follies of Fashion. Signs hung from the ceiling, pointing her in every direction. HOUSEWARES. COSMETICS. HOSIERY. ACTIVEWEAR. In the ladies' wear department, Mossimo cardigans were folded neatly on shelves, and puffer jackets lined the walls, price tags hanging from their cuffs. Headless white mannequins displayed graphic tees, blazers, wrap dresses and casual button-ups. And then there were the rows of shoes, black and brown, symmetrically arranged and smelling vaguely of plastic, next to a display of gloves, with their long, outstretched fingers and narrow palms of a Byzantine Madonna, adorned with Hello Kitty and Despicable Me characters. Gloves in camouflage and houndstooth, knit flip-top gloves, Smart Touch gloves, fingerless gloves and knitted mittens. Thinsulate, Champion and Isotoner. They had the stiff, almost pubescent grace of women's accessories when they have never been worn.Emily moved forward as if propelled by a mysterious force of desire. The lingerie department impressed her with its sublimity and grace. She swept past the Gilligan & O'Malley camisoles, robes and nightgowns in pinks and purples, past plush house slippers printed like cows, nude Spanx shorts and bins of panties in variegated colors, some striped and some polka-dotted. She ran her delicate fingers over the red lace Santa teddy trimmed with white feathers like the driven snow. She saw yoga pants for $19.99 and yoga mats for $29.99. New Year's Specials! Everything seemed to mingle, so she could no longer distinguish one department from another. Ladies crowded around her, a multitude entirely absorbed by what surrounded them. A lady with the round face of a merry person paused, as if intoxicated by the lace that engulfed her, and held up a nightgown.""Do you like this?"" she asked.""Yes. It's nice,"" Emily replied, awed by the extraordinary sheen of the polyester printed with rosebuds.The store was alive. A tight surge of heads was flowing through the aisles, expanding into a flood in the seasonal Christmas section. Thanks to the vigorous use of their elbows, ladies pushed past one another, destined for the walls adorned with colorful ornaments, tinsel and artificial wreaths. Above, a lurid green sign in the shape of an arrow proclaimed: HOLIDAY SHOP NOW ALL ON SALE. Mechanically, Emily walked up the aisles, staring wide-eyed at a light-up pink flamingo wearing a winter scarf and pausing afresh at each new display of Star Wars ornaments, mass-produced old-fashioned-looking knit ornaments and A Christmas Story ornaments. Buy Two, Get One Free*. MUST GO!!!! 50% off! A vast display of The Muppet Christmas Carol DVDs unfolded in front of her. Rolls of patterned wrapping paper, spools of ribbon and bags of bows, as well as reindeer antlers for automobiles, leopard-print Santa hats, Josh Groban CDs, gingerbread houses, boxes of Christmas lights and a 10-foot pre-lit tree decorated with snowflakes hovering over this bucolic winter world like a watchful god. The bright displays made her blush with pleasure. So many things, all marked down.A commercial battle was underway around her, and ladies gasped approvingly at decorative bells and candles scented of cinnamon, overwhelmed by the sheer ecstasy of seeing and touching these things they would buy for the next holiday season. The moment had come for the fearsome morning rush, when the super-heated machine led the customers round the floor, squeezing the money from their very flesh. Emily gasped for breath, as if exhausted. All she could hear, above the great hum of the shoppers, was a medley of Christmas songs proclaiming Joy to the world. She scrambled toward the overflowing checkout lines, where customers were placing their precious goods on conveyor belts, the shop girls scanning each treasure taken from the carts. The lady in front of Emily produced two boxes of Giada De Laurentiis minestrone soup mix, four light blue Threshold bath towels with matching hand towels and washcloths, a red KitchenAid mixer, a large bag of Purina One dog food and a box of Glad ForceFlex tall kitchen garbage bags, and the shop girl gently nestled this precious cargo into white plastic bags. A compound of noise: the constant padding of feet, the same phrases repeated a hundred times across the counters -- ""Do you have a card with us? No? Would you like to get one?"" -- and debit cards swiping. ""This is a cute sweater,"" the shop girl said to Emily, as she rang up her goods. ""I haven't seen this one.""""It's from the Merona collection,"" she responded, eyeing the black turtleneck, dark like a raven, its fabric soft to the touch and promising a world of supreme joys. ""Or maybe it was Mossimo. Anyway, you also have it in gray. It's on sale.""""These thank you cards are pretty, too,"" said the shop girl, eyeing a small and elegant box of stationery. ""I never get the chance to look around and see any of this stuff. Well, Happy New Year!"" It was indeed a world of happiness. Shoppers dashed out into the parking lot, their glistening silver carts teeming with white plastic bags. The bags were of a dazzling whiteness, as was the fluorescently-lit store the shoppers left behind, a boreal vista, a whole landscape of artificial snow, extending to infinity in steppes hung with faux fur like glaciers heaped and shining under the sun. The whiteness of the outside windows was repeated, but here rekindled, colossal, blazing from one end of the huge taupe building to the other with the white intensity of a burning fire. There was nothing but white: all the white plastic bags heaped into automobiles, a riot of white, a white star that at first blinded one with its fixed radiance, so that the details were indistinguishable in this unrelieved white, and all eyes dazzled with such suburban splendor."

Montt was on trial for genocide linked to the massacres of indigenous communities in the early 1980s. (Photo: Elena Hermosa)On May 10, 2013, a Guatemalan court, in a historic decision, found former dictator and army general José Efraín Ríos Montt guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity. It was the first time a former head of state had been prosecuted successfully in his native country for genocide, and the first time a high-level leader was convicted in Guatemala for the horrendous crimes that took place during that country's 36-year civil war. I was in the courtroom the day the verdict was handed down, one of a team of international observers monitoring the process. It was a historic moment. The victims, members of the Maya Ixil community, rejoiced at the ruling. The Judiciary, part of the Guatemalan state, weighed the evidence, and found that there had been genocide. It was a vindication of their struggle of three decades to have their pain and suffering acknowledged, and those responsible punished.However, under pressure by economic elites and sectors of the armed forces, the Constitutional Court undid the ruling, just ten days later. Arguing a legal technicality, it set the trial back a month and thereby invalidated the verdict. Domestic and international groups appealed to the Constitutional Court to overturn its ruling, arguing that the proper route to challenge the decision was via a normal appeal process, and that the majority opinion was flawed. Two judges wrote dissenting opinions substantiating these and other points. The Constitutional Court held fast to its decision. A new tribunal was named to oversee the retrial, but claiming that its dockets were full, said it would not be able to hear the genocide case until January 2015. In the meantime, the crusading attorney general who was the architect of the genocide case, Claudia Paz y Paz, was forced out of office early, and the presiding trial judge, Yassmín Barrios, has faced legal sanctions and media opprobium.With the New Year upon us, the genocide trial is slated to begin on January 5. Several obstacles to restarting the trial have been cleared. Most significantly, on December 18, the Constitutional Court unanimously ruled that the decision of a pretrial judge, which argued that the proceedings should return to November 2011, prior to the date of Ríos Montt's indictment, was illegal and should be nullified. That was the ruling that, on April 18, 2013, dramatically halted the genocide trial in mid-process. The ruling vindicates the decision of trial court judge Yassmín Barrios, who refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of that decision, which she deemed to be clearly illegal.The one remaining obstacle is, however, the amnesty question. During the 2013 proceedings, an appeals court rejected one of the many legal motions presented by Ríos Montt's defense team calling for an earlier amnesty law to be applied. That amnesty law, passed in 1986 by then-dictator General Mejía Víctores with the intention of guaranteeing immunity from prosecution for all crimes committed during his government as well as that of his predecessor, Ríos Montt, in which he served as defense minister, was annulled. Another law, the National Reconciliation Law, allowed for amnesty for political crimes, but explicitly excluded international crimes of genocide, torture, and crimes against humanity. However, in one of several perplexing decisions, the Constitutional Court sent the ruling back to the appeals court, requesting that the decision be substantiated. While this may appear non controversial, many observers feared that it opened the door for the appeals court to reverse its ruling and apply the 1986 amnesty law.Over 60 judges recused themselves from participating in the appeals court called upon to rule on the amnesty question, suggesting the controversial nature of endeavor. But, as Edgar Pérez, a human rights lawyer internationally recognized for his work on behalf of the victims of Guatemala's internal armed conflict, told me back in October while visiting Washington, D.C., December is the month of surprises in Guatemala. Indeed, just two days before Christmas, the appeals court was formally constituted, and has five working days to emit its decision. International organizations, including the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a non-profit human rights organization where I am a Senior Fellow, have published a statement calling on the appeals court to limit itself to following the Constitutional Court's request to substantiate its decision that the amnesty law is not applicable. We reminded the appeals court that Guatemalan law as well as international law do not allow amnesty for international crimes, and that the Guatemalan state has the international obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish grave violations of human rights.In the meantime, Congress has been convened for a special session on December 29, presumably to extend the state of emergency currently in place due to a devastating drought. There is concern that this might provide an opportunity for the Congress to decree a new amnesty law altogether. This fear is not entirely unfounded. In May 2014, the Guatemalan Congress passed a resolution declaring that there had been no genocide during the 36-year civil war and calling for ""national reconciliation."" Civil society groups decried this as blatant interference in the judicial process, since determining guilt for genocide is the role of a trial court. President Otto Pérez Molina, himself an army commander in the Ixil area during the Ríos Montt's rule, has also declared repeatedly that there was no genocide in Guatemala. International law clearly rejects the possibility of amnesty for genocide and other grave human rights violations.If the genocide trial does restart, the role of the international community will be of utmost importance to ensuring a fair process. There is little doubt that there will be strong opposition from conservative elites and from sectors of the military. But the desire for the victims for truth and justice remains steadfast. Like victims in other situations of oppression, they know that, as Martin Luther King, Jr. famously proclaimed, ""the arc of the moral universe may be long, but it ultimately bends toward justice."""

(Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb776b2200000c5010165e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You may have seen the latest headline about Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers giving his offensive lineman and backup QB's impressive gifts this Christmas. Apparently Rodgers gave them each a 55 inch Samsung TV, Beats headphones and a tablet of some sort. He was not required to do it, he just did it out of the goodness of his heart. The 55 inch curved smart TV is roughly $1500 at Walmart, the tablet about $300-ish and the Beats sell for about $270 at the Apple Store. So we'll say he's in for about $2100 each...maybe a bit more or less. If you count up all the lineman on the team and practice squad and add in the QBs, it's apparently about 14(?) players who got the gifts. $28 grand! Wow! Very generous of him indeed.One thing we probably should do with such an elaborate gift is to break it down to what an apples to apples gift might look like if a similar ""boss"" or leader wanted to show holiday generosity to his employees out of his or her pocket. The $110 million deal Rodgers signed in 2013 made him the highest paid player in the NFL on a yearly basis and now marks him (deservedly) as one of the top two highest paid QBs. If you add it all up, it averages out to about $20 million a year. In addition, he is also reportedly one of the highest paid players in the Nike stable and has a very public deal with State Farm as well, causing Forbes to estimate his annual income at about $49 million. If you make $49 million a year, that's $134,246.58 a day. So in effect, he spent about 1/5 of a day's salary on the 14 guys who play some role in keeping him from being a tackling dummy for JJ Watt. Back to our everyday boss or manager of people who has people protecting him or her from JJ- Watt-ish type problems every day. If that leader made $100,000, he or she would make $273.97 a day and would need to spend about $60 on his 14 best people to match Aaron Rodgers dollar for dollar. If you went for cheap chocolates you could get each person a box. If you went high end, you could get them each a holiday drink at Starbucks. The gift was not publicized at all by Rodgers or the Packers, it leaked out on Twitter as those who got the gifts genuinely shared their delight and surprise. The linemen subsequently interviewed for the stories have been uniformly glowing in their praise of Rodgers as a leader and teammate. They were surprised and thankful, just as anyone should be who looks in his locker and sees it unexpectedly packed with high-end gifts. Or any gift for that matter.The ones who should take note are not those who were involved in what appears to have been intended to be private gift-giving, but those of us who seem so wowed by such unexpected generosity. The zeros and the dollar values confuse the subject for every day Joes like the rest of us and we miss the point. Are we as generous as Aaron? Or less?I know for me this year the answer is sadly LESS. I have about 35 or so people who work with me in a small company that makes RUTF, a peanut butter concoction for malnourished children. It takes all 35 of us to make our effort click and work seamlessly, just as it takes every guy on the Packers Roster to make a winning team. As the CEO of the company I am likely the most easily compared to a QB and as such, like Aaron Rodgers, I have about 14 or so people, who really cover my butt every single day. They make sure our product is safe, they ship it on time, they deal with vendors, arrange contracts, negotiate our terms and sales with big entities like UNICEF and USAID. The jobs they do protect us from problems every bit as devastating and daunting as JJ Watt is to opposing QBs.While our company managed a Christmas bonus, I did not reach into my pocket and get anyone anything! Nothing! Not a chocolate bar, not a latte! When I compared my personal generosity towards my teammates who protect me and save me from getting ""sacked"" with that of Aaron Rodgers it shamed me. I don't expect you'll be impressed that I just went online and got them all a box of chocolates as a New Year's gift. My belated gift should not make headlines, it is quite literally the least I could do. Um, other than what I did originally... which was to forget. I'm still not sure after doing the math that I am impressed with Aaron Rodgers generosity, but I am impressed that a busy guy who people look to as a leader stopped to make a kind gesture. While my guys and gals would be way more happy with the TV and the tablet, maybe the box of chocolates is a start towards being a more generous and thoughtful leader. Maybe the old saying ""its the thought that counts"" is more true than trite. Thanks for the reminder Aaron. You beat me (and maybe many of us) this year with your generosity. Here is hoping that next year we'll up the ante for leaders being more gracious with those who quietly make their teams so successful. And no matter what Aaron does for his linemen, hopefully many of us will out-give him."
12,HEALTHY LIVING,A New Feature On The Golden Gate Bridge Could Save Hundreds Of Lives A Year,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/golden-gate-bridge-suicide-barrier-design_n_6374712.html,,2014-12-29,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JUNE 27: The span of the Golden Gate Bridge disappears into the fog on June 27, 2014 in San Francisco, California. The Golden Gate Bridge district's board of directors voted unanimously to approve a $76 million funding package to build a net suicide barrier on the iconic span. Over 1,500 people committed suicide by jumping from the iconic bridge since it opened in 1937. 46 people jumped to their death in 2013. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e78ac1f00002d002206f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this year, a startling statistic emerged: People jumped to their deaths from the Golden Gate Bridge in 2013 at a rate of almost once a week. Now, officials have approved a final safety net design that activists hope will inspire similar efforts at suicide destinations around the world.The $76 million suicide barrier design was approved Friday by the Golden Gate Bridge District, whose board green-lit funding for the project in June. The barrier will consist of a stainless steel cable net extending 20 feet downward and outward from the side of the bridge. The project, which comes after half a century of funding deliberations and shelved designs, is expected to be completed within three years and will be paid for by the bridge district, Caltrans, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Mental Health Services Act.“I think the Golden Gate Bridge can serve as a model for other bridges,” Dr. Jill Harkavy-Friedman, a psychologist and the vice president of research at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told The Huffington Post. “I hope we’ll see more and more of this.”The Golden Gate Bridge is thought to be the country’s -- and possibly the world’s -- top suicide location. More than 1,600 people are believed to have taken their own lives there, although the exact number is unclear, because the California Highway Patrol stopped counting and releasing the data in 1995 amid concerns that it was encouraging jumpers.While many people believe that someone considering suicide will not be deterred by a barrier at one site, and will simply seek out another method for ending his or her life, experts say that research strongly suggests otherwise.“If you block the access to lethal means when a person is in a suicidal crisis, they actually don’t think of alternatives,"" Harkavy-Friedman told HuffPost. ""When someone is in a suicidal crisis, their thinking is very fixed and they have tunnel vision. What a barrier does is give time for the crisis to pass and for help to arrive.”She pointed to a study on the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England, that found that in the years before the bridge erected suicide barriers, relatively few of its jumpers had a history of self-harm or psychiatric treatment -- suggesting that most of the people who jumped did so on impulse. After the barriers went up, suicides from the bridge were reduced by half, and there was no corresponding increase of suicides at other bridges. What's more, most of the people who did manage to jump to their deaths after the barriers were put up had histories that suggested their suicides were not impulsive, and that they jumped because they were determined to do so.  Anecdotal evidence from suicide attempt survivors also suggests that potential Golden Gate Bridge jumpers may not seek out other methods once the new construction is in place.“Of the small number of people who have survived jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge, nearly all have said afterward that it was the Golden Gate Bridge or nothing. They didn't have a Plan B,” John Bateson, author of The Final Leap: Suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge, wrote last year in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times.It's only been a few months since San Francisco lost its hometown hero Robin Williams, who took his own life at his Bay Area home in August following years of battling depression. Williams' death gave way to a national conversation about ending the stigma surrounding mental illness.“Ninety percent of people who die by suicide have a diagnosable and potentially treatable illness,” Harkavy-Friedman said. “I think that’s the biggest misconception here.”Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline."

""I'm going to be doing everything I can to close,"" the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Obama flatly said to CNN's Candy Crowley. ""It [Gitmo] is something that continues to inspire jihadists and extremists around the world, the fact that these folks are being held. It is contrary to our values.""Supporters of closing the Gitmo detention center, of course, have heard this type of talk from President Obama before. Whether during the 2007-2008 Democratic primaries, the November 2008 general election, or during his first six years as president of the United States, Obama has always depicted the Gitmo facility as a symbol of the George W. Bush years -- a period of time that the former constitutional law professor and Harvard law student has regarded as a divisive and needlessly provocative chapter in U.S. history. Locking up terrorist suspects in a U.S. prison run on foreign soil for years without the due process of law Americans expect from their government, was the epitome of that ""war on terror"" era. Entering the seventh year of his presidency, there is every indication that Obama and his administration are preparing for the full-court press that anti-Gitmo advocates have long been waiting for. Guantanamo may be a relic of the Bush years, but the Obama White House is gearing up to make the closure of the detention facility a top line-item in 2015. As Paul Lewis, the Pentagon's Guantanamo envoy, told the Washington Post, ""He does not want to leave this [Gitmo] to his successor."" If that's indeed his intention, then Obama will have to leverage the same executive authority that proved so critical to taking action on immigration, hashing out a climate accord with China, and rolling out a new U.S. policy on Cuba.On Gitmo, Congress is the big elephant in the room that has kept the White House from shuttering a facility that has outlived its usefulness. For the past several years, Congress has prohibited any money from being spent to either construct prisons in the United States to house Guantanamo detainees or to transfer those prisoners to maximum security facilities in the United States. With those restrictions solidly in place -- the 2015 omnibus spending bill also requires the Secretary of State to send a written report to the Appropriations Committees on the terms of any transfer agreement with foreign countries -- the president and his national security team will need to get creative if they hope to meet the high expectations that they have set for themselves for the new year. Quickly moving on the list of prisoners who have been authorized for release is the quickest way to ensure that Gitmo does, in fact, become a part of the past.  Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty ImagesThe question is not whether President Obama will try to fast-track detainee releases, but rather how he is going to frame the debate. The Wall Street Journal reports that, in a desperate bid to thin out the population at Guantanamo, the administration will begin to cast the prison as a waste of taxpayer money rather than a moral strain on America's compass. It could be a very good, practical argument to make, given Washington's obsession with trying to find a segment of the budget that can be cut in order to save money for future programs. This argument will also put Republican fiscal hawks in the uncomfortable position of defending the utility and effectiveness of a detention facility that costs hundreds of millions of dollars to keep open (roughly $2.7 million per prisoner). President Obama may hope that Congress will begin to smarten up and loosen the restrictions that have kept Gitmo open, but the fact of the matter is that he is completely on his own. Obama will get no help from a Republican-led Congress that has consistently touted the Guantanamo prison as a critical enabler of America's counterterrorism efforts. This will mean far more aggressive action on the part of the White House, the Defense Department, and the State Department in the year ahead. Expect the State Department to ramp up negotiations with countries that are willing to house Gitmo prisoners who are cleared for release; expect the White House to constantly be in the Pentagon's ear on approving those transfers; and expect the National Security Council to use every loophole in its executive authority to decrease the prison's population. Despite losing the Senate majority this past November, Obama has spent the last month and a half using his executive authority on the very same issues (immigration, climate change, Cuba) he wants resolved before his presidency ends. Congressional Republicans don't like it, and have condemned the president as an emperor who has discarded the entire concept of checks-and-balances and the U.S. Constitution. Righty or wrongly, Republicans will be even more upset in the months ahead, as the Obama administration makes 2015 the ""year of action"" on Guantanamo Bay."

Young girls received the message that they, too, could achieve whatever they wanted.The Beaver got a  boost of self-confidence -- something from which all children and adults can benefit.Here's another clip from a legendary show that will amuse Baby Boomers, bring back fond memories and remind us of the great times gone by -- even as we prepare to move forward and reshape the landscape of the 21st Century! It's wonderful to remember old friends from our childhood. We were all entertained by The Honeymooners. It showcased a very different style of life than that enjoyed today.It's the 21st Century. Yet as we look back on a 1950's TV show, it's interesting to note that as much as things change they stay the same.A simpler age and less complicated life was a struggle for The Kramden's, just as our more sophisticated one is for so many now.Ralph was always stressed-out over money. Yet in the best sense of our nation's post-war belief in limitless opportunity, he demonstrated unfailing creativity and resolve. Here was a man not to be stopped -- despite Alice's invariable opposition.Ralph may be the first entrepreneur Baby Boomers encountered. He always had guaranteed get-rich-quick schemes. They all failed. So what! If at first you don't succeed...Through adversity, Ralph and Alice were brought closer together and it was easy to see the bond they shared. It permeated their relationship and leapt off the screen and into our consciousness. Today, Baby Boomers comprise the largest growing segment of entrepreneurs. Luckily, we're meeting with far greater success than Ralph. Of course we have a lot more going for us! Imagine starting a business without the vast resources of the Internet. Unthinkable! Unlike Alice, we understand the need to openly support our partners. An encouraging pat on the back or peck on the cheek strengthens all unions.   Then, too, we might learn from Ed Norton! As we reflect upon his character it's interesting to note that he was rarely stressed -- except when Ralph was berating him for some alleged offense. More on eliminating stress in a moment.His happy-go-lucky disposition was one from which we can learn an important lesson: Don't take yourself or life too seriously.Perhaps Norton was a simple man. If so, then hurrah for simplicity.There's a reason for the success and timelessness of The Honeymooners. Despite all the frustration, trials and tribulations of their daily existence, Ralph and Alice loved one another deeply.As we all enjoy the holiday season, let's keep in mind what's most important in life. While I can't speak for other Baby Boomers, it's my guess that for the vast majority of us, family and friends are what count most.This is a great time of year to become mindful of just how important our relationships are. And perhaps take a vow to appreciate them more.Don't sweat the small stuff!Yes, life is a lot more complicated than it was 60 years ago. And YES, we possess more self-knowledge than the generations that preceded us. Put it to good use! Never let mindless stress and minutiae interfere in your relationships. The word 'honeymoon' has a great connotation. The Honeymooners always ended up happy!Live in and for the moment. Have and show gratitude for all your good fortune. Let's not forget those who are in need and do our part to help alleviate the hunger and poverty that exists in this the greatest country in the world. I wish all readers a happy holiday season filled with love, health, peace and joy. Remember, you are entitled to a wonderful, rewarding and fulfilled life! Have fun and enjoy yourself. We only go around once -- make the most of it!"

We visited with special friends and the children were showered in love by many angels! We baked together and decorated cookies; we laughed and we cried. Children were overloaded with sugar, so we might have even ""yelled"" a bit. We played with toys, and by the time our heads (Pappa and Grammy and Daddy and Mommy's) were about to explode, we made beds in the living room at Pappa and Gramm's house and settled in for a fun Christmas movie. This year the kids watched a documentary about Santa (Lucas A. Nast). It was pretty amazing. So from that point forward, the kids began researching and coming up with a plan to see if Santa was real. Each child wrote Santa letters. I will share Bella's. I asked them to pick two things they desperately wanted. Bella requested for Santa to write her a letter. She wouldn't put down a toy, because she wanted to prove Santa was real and a toy substitute would not do. So she hatched a plan. We'll all sleep in the living room. She slept right in front of the entry to the tree. She was determined to catch a glimpse of the myth to prove it was true... We went to sleep. At around 4 a.m., I hear, ""Santa!"" Followed by a deep and jolly, ""Ho Ho Ho""...Could it be? Next, as I'm trying to wake up out of a deep sleep: ""Santa, can we take a selfie?"" (Oh, this generation.) Santa, so beautiful and real, was sitting in our living room sharing a special moment with each child. Then the kids began to ask Santa questions. Bella asked about the name Lucas A. Nast, which Santa did not confirm or deny. But what he did do was take off his beautiful trademark hat, and underneath that hat was a beautiful white head of hair, about which Bella said, ""Oh, your hair is so beautiful and shining."" What did we see with our eyes? An exact resemblance to this legend Lucas A. Nast. He certainly had the exact same spirit. Anabelle, our 2-year-old, exhausted, awakened by this stranger in a beautiful red suit, who smelled of fresh cookies, as Bella said, wasn't paying him much attention. She wouldn't sit in his lap and take a picture with him. See, last year during this time I was sick the first time with cancer. I never took her to the ""mall,"" so she had no experience with this jolly man who spreads cheer to children. Out of the blue, she climbed up on him and snuggled him so tight. My heart melted. It took my breath away. She just snuggled in his arms. Santa told the kids how important it is to believe. He showed the kids his beautiful white gloves. How they get dirty in chimneys and travel. Sometimes they get so dirty, he needs new ones. He asked Bella to be responsible for cleaning them and asked the kids to place them by the tree every year just in case his are ever too dirty, so he can pick them up at our home. How special, the Amento kids -- ""The Keepers of Santa's Gloves.""Then Santa told us he had another house to get to before heading back to the North Pole. He asked us if he could pray with us. A moment to pray with Santa? Yes please. We bowed our heads and prayed with Santa. The tears because of this gentle-spirited man rolled down my face. This was a perfect ending to a treasured memory. I know everyone has conflicting views on Santa. Some believe it takes away from the true meaning of Christmas. Some believe you're teaching a child to believe in a lie. Others celebrate the idea of Santa. There are so many different beliefs. I respect them all. I'm not trying to sway or debate anyone. For us, it is so important for the children to believe. It is so important for us to believe. Especially, to believe in something that cannot be seen. We desperately need the children to believe. I am ""sick"" with Stage IV Cancer. The understanding that they can lose me is very real. Belief is the only thing they have. If they only dealt with ""reality,"" or what they see, imagine how defeating this would be. They would be waiting for me to die, instead of believing in the hope of a miracle. Thank God for the belief in what we cannot see. It is so important too for my husband and me to believe! The gloves, those magical white gloves. They are being cleaned. I'm going to get a display case for them and engrave it with ""Santa's Visit 2014"" -- and on the back have the story of the Christmas that we met Santa along with a picture. When the children have families of their own, each year they can take turns putting out the box that encases Santa's white gloves, sharing with their families the Christmas miracle we experienced that year. Thank you, Santa. Thank you for taking the time to remind us how important it is to believe! I believe. I believe in hope; I believe in what is not seen; I believe in the spirit of Christmas..."
16,SCIENCE,How The Effects Of Trauma Can Be Passed Down From One Generation To The Next,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trauma-generations_n_6315608.html,,2014-12-28,"Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, heart and cross memorial near Sandy Hook Firehouse on Riverside Road in Sandy Hook, CT (Photo By: Enid Alvarez/NY Daily News via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baec3dc240000300096852e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Experiencing trauma early in childhood can lead to mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood, but mild to moderate trauma could also have an unexpected upside for some survivors, making them better able to cope with stressful situations later in life. Previous research has shown that the behavioral effects of trauma can be passed down to the next generation -- but this research had only demonstrated that this transmission takes place with trauma's negative effects, such as depression. Now a study on mice, recently published in the journal Nature Communications, suggests that the adaptive benefits of trauma might also stay alive in families through the years. The University of Zurich researchers identified the molecular mechanisms by which the effects of trauma are transmitted from one generation to another. In some cases, the silver lining of a traumatic episode -- that is, learning to better cope with stress -- can also be passed down. ""This study builds on our previous work in mice showing that exposure to traumatic stress during early life has detrimental effects on behavior across generations -- it induces depression, antisocial behaviors, memory impairment, etc.,"" the study's lead researcher, neuroepigeneticist Isabelle Mansuy, said in an email to The Huffington Post. ""We wondered if it may provide some benefit in certain conditions, such as in challenging situations.""To examine the effects and transmission of this benefit, the researchers put newborn male mice under traumatic stress by removing them from their mothers at regular intervals, which also put the mothers under significant stress. When the male mice were adults, they and their offspring underwent tests to analyze their behavior. The mice who had undergone early trauma were compared to a control group of mice who were not subjected to stress.The researchers found that the trauma-exposed mice and their offspring were able to complete difficult tasks more efficiently than the mice in the control group. They were also found to have show improvements in goal-oriented behavior in difficult situations. ""Because they or their father were placed in challenging conditions when young, they developed strategies to more efficiently respond to future exposure later in life,"" Mansuy told The Huffington Post. In both groups, the fathers were kept apart from the offspring and their mothers -- the offspring, then, could not have learned this behavior from their fathers and instead must have inherited it. The researchers then examined the activity of a gene implicated in flexible behavior, and found that ""epigenetic marks"" (which determine how much a gene is expressed) were altered in this gene, in the brain and the sperm of the stressed fathers. The altered marks were passed down to the mice's offspring. ""Our results show that environmental factors change behavior and that these changes can be passed on to the next generation,"" Mansuy said in a statement. Although the researchers emphasize that they are not suggesting that childhood trauma is positive in any way, the findings do suggest that experiencing trauma -- if children are supported and able to cope effectively -- could have positive as well as negative cross-generational effects.

The Salt Lake City Council is decrying the rejection of a Mormon LGBT group's proposed float in Utah's most popular parade, but it won't pull out of the event. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f637240000310098ae18.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s painful to feel like an outsider -- especially during Christmas.However, it’s a feeling that LGBT members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints may experience during the holidays. While the church insists that gay and lesbian Mormons should be treated with kindness, it sees acting out on same-sex attractions as a sin. As a result, LGBT Mormons who have grown up celebrating Christmas with their church communities may be hesitant to come back.But there’s a growing number of people within the Mormon church who aren’t afraid to show their support for their LGBT brothers and sisters.On December 21, about 200 allies volunteered for “Sit With Me Sunday,” promising to sit with LGBT people who are uncomfortable about attending a service.It’s unclear how many LGBT members took the group up on their offer. Campaign organizer Sherri Park, who is on the steering committee for Mormons Building Bridges, said that some people felt so anxious about returning that at the last minute, they decided not to go. She estimates less than 50 pairs of people participated this year.In the Mormon church, people are assigned to wards, or congregations, depending on where they live. Sometimes, people get assigned to a ward that provides a safe spiritual space for gays and lesbians, and at other times, they’re not so lucky.“It’s like roulette,” Park told HuffPost. “It really depends on who your ward leadership is . . . So people mostly either don’t come at all or they come and cringe when they hear something said about gay people being evil. It’s so painful.”Park wanted to make it easier for LGBT people to identify individuals and families who are willing to be allies, creating a map for members in the US. For the families that took part, it was an incredibly affirming experience.Jill Hazard Rowe, an LDS mom from Draper, Utah, volunteered to sit with a young man from her town. He had grown up in the church and explored his spirituality by serving on a mission. When he returned, he realized that his same-sex attractions weren’t going away. Rowe, who has a gay son herself, wanted to make sure that this young man felt welcomed and loved in church during this year’s Christmas season. Rowe, her husband, her children, and parents turned up in force to sit with the young man during Sunday’s worship service.“It sounds weird, but having him sit next to me made me feel more Christian,” Rowe said. “It’s obviously not about me, I know. But I just felt complete and whole to know that this is what God approves of, that we love everyone.”“My hope is for everyone to be educated on the issue and realize that this isn’t a choice and just really strive to be Christian,” she continued.Peter Harrison, a 20-year-old LDS member from Sandy, Utah, knows young Mormons who were turned out of their homes after their parents found out about their sexual orientation. He remembers attending church-sponsored dances when he was younger, where the lines between genders were drawn very clearly and he couldn’t dance with the people he wanted to dance with.Harrison was initially worried that his own parents wouldn’t accept him after he came out to them. But not only were they welcoming and affirming -- members of his church community also embraced him wholeheartedly. “You hear a lot of negative stories, but there are people within the LDS church who are supportive and want people to feel welcome in church and to feel a closeness to God, which is what church provide,” Harrison told The Huffington Post.Harrison wasn’t able to attend Sit With Me Sunday this year, but he has fond memories of last year’s event. It was powerful for him to feel that level of acceptance, he said. Harrison is hoping that in the coming years, the church will become more open towards same-sex couples -- and perhaps even welcome them into leadership roles.“The church is a large organization and you’ve got hundreds of families dealing with this issue,” Harrison said. “It’s going to be more front and center as families raise kids who are gay and couples come forward wanting to serve in the church.” "

M. Rubin's global education report from Canada, China, the US and the UK.In December, I continued my conversations with world leaders on the frontiers of education reform. These leaders (from Canada, China, America and the UK) all share a commitment to transforming education at the ground level, so that the poorest and most disadvantaged schools can become sites for development of innovative education and can create smart and employable future citizens. From Canada, I talked to Mary Jean Gallagher, (Chief Student Achievement Officer of Ontario and Assistant Deputy Minister of the Student Achievement Division of the Ontario Ministry of Education) about the extensive educational turnaround in Ontario. The statistics are proof of the significant success. For instance, over the past decade, the percentage of students meeting provincial standards in the annual literacy and numeracy tests for grades three and six has risen from 54 percent to 71 percent, and the high school graduation rate has increased from 68 percent to 83 percent. Gallagher explains that this was caused by offering support at multiple levels of the system: ""Support is provided in the form of advice, shared research into effective practices, opportunities for exchanging insights among peers, and the funding per school ($15,000) for release time out of the normal work schedule for planning, monitoring, reflecting on and integrating what is being learned into classroom practice.""From China, I talked to Jiang Xueqin (deputy principal of highly regarded Tsinghua University High School) about how to offer progressive education in a nation where the gap between rich and poor is immense. This requires creating programs early on for the disadvantaged children in China, investing in vocational programs, and building a national system of community colleges. He also spoke of his teaching philosophy: ""It requires tremendous emotional intelligence, self-understanding, wisdom, maturity, and confidence to maintain a minimal interventionist attitude while offering non-judgmental support and encouragement. Teachers and students are the real stars of any great school, and real education leadership means playing a backstage and supporting role."" From the United States, I talked to Harvard professor Howard Gardner about how his innovative concept, Good Grit, meaning the combination of character and drive, can be applied to education systems across the globe. Gardner was joined by Jeffrey Beard from the UK (former Director General of the International Baccalaureate Organization, now Founder and Chairman of Global Study Pass). Gardner and Beard show that Good Grit is a breakthrough concept in education reform and can pave the way for students to do better in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. Moreover, Gardner and Beard suggest that Good Grit will lead to a more collaborative and ethical future. In the words of Gardner, ""If you simply want to have the most toys at the end of life, you might get away with Bad or Compromised Grit. But if you pursue goals beyond self-aggrandizement, then you can do well both for yourself and for the world. And even if you don't aim to change the world, being truthful and trustworthy serve you well in every marketplace.""Finally, I want to take this opportunity to wish a very happy new year to all our contributors and followers around the world.

If you'd prefer never to experience foodborne illness for yourself, there are several things worth keeping in mind.What we call ""food poisoning"" takes several forms, and they're all quite unpleasant, to say the least. You can contract a foodborne illness by eating food contaminated by bacteria, viruses, or parasites, as well as food containing toxins, like poisonous mushrooms. Vomiting, fever, aches, and repeated trips to the bathroom (we'll leave it at that) are common symptoms of foodborne illness, and in extreme cases a trip to the hospital may be necessary, especially if you become seriously dehydrated. Click Here to See Don't Get Food Poisoning! 10 Tips to Help Avoid ItThe improper handling, storage, or preparation of food is the most common cause of food poisoning. While food safety is (or should be) a concern at just about every restaurant or other establishment that serves food, sometimes things fall through the cracks, and people get sick. Even eating unwashed lettuce can cause bacterial infections like E. coli or viral infections like hepatitis A, which are definitely not fun. There have been several major foodborne illness outbreaks in recent years, caused by everything from cheese sauce left sitting out for too long to contaminated alfalfa sprouts, and even large chains are susceptible. If you're looking to avoid food poisoning, the most important tool to use is your brain. If you walk into a restaurant that's filthy, you can probably assume that the kitchen will be in even worse shape than the dining room, and no one will blame you for high tailing it out of there. If you're on the fence about whether that week-old tuna sandwich is still any good, throw it out, because the joy you may receive from eating it isn't worth the agony that will likely ensue.

Israel put the number of its dead at 67 troops and 6 civilians.During their visit, Marshak said, the children were to have toured Arab towns in Israel as well as southern areas that had been under threat of Gaza rockets. They were also scheduled to attend a performance by a Jewish-Arab band and visit a mixed-race school, the Tel Aviv beach and a nearby safari.The schedule also included a meeting with Abbas in Ramallah.Goodwill visits to Israel from Gaza are rare given ongoing hostility with Islamist Hamas, though Palestinian patients from the impoverished enclave are regularly admitted for pressing medical treatment.Eyad Al-Bozom, spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Gaza, said the children had been stopped from crossing into Israel ""to preserve the culture and tradition of our people"" and because they were slated to visit ""suspicious"" sites. He did not elaborate.Malek Freij, director of the charity Candle for Peace which was also named on the children's Israeli military-issued entry permit, said he and fellow organizers had sent 40 truckloads of aid into Gaza during the war and had previously hosted a small number of Palestinian orphans.He said that this time, advance Israeli media reports of the children's planned visit apparently led Hamas to cancel it.""They (Gaza authorities) thought that Israel wants to exploit these children, and that's a mistake,"" Freij told Reuters next to the empty bus awaiting the group on the Israeli side of the Gaza border.
