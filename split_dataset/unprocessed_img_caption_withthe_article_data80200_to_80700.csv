In 2009, NOM funneled more than $2 million to the group Stand for Marriage Maine, which led the ballot fight to stop same-sex marriage in the state. That contribution amounted to one-third of Stand for Marriage Maine's donations, but NOM refused to make its donors public.In May 2014, the Maine Ethics Commission ruled that NOM had violated campaign finance law and ordered the conservative group to pay a $50,250 penalty and release its donors. Although NOM paid the penalty, it continued to resist disclosure. The organization, however, officially lost that fight on Aug. 4, when the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ordered it to hand over its donors, resulting in Monday's filing.As the Portland Press Herald notes, of the seven donors who gave more than $100 to NOM, only one was actually from the state of Maine: Richard Kurtz, who, along with his wife, has also donated to Gov. Paul LePage (R) and the Maine Republican Party.NOM's biggest donor was Sean Fieler, a New York hedge fund executive who gave $1.25 million. Fieler has spent more than $4.6 million on state and federal political campaigns and super PACs since 2010, and millions more on anti-marriage equality groups. He and his wife have also started funding anti-transgender rights efforts across the country.Opponents of Maine's marriage equality law launched their campaign to stop it the day after the governor signed it. The ballot measure ended up passing, 53 to 47 percent, and the law never went into effect.In June, the Supreme Court ruled that state bans on marriage equality are unconstitutional.

Immigration courts closed more than 12,000 cases of women and children without representation by the end of June, versus about 2,000 cases with representation. Of the families that went up against the court system by themselves, 97.7 percent received a deportation order. For the smaller number of families with legal representation, 67.1 percent of the cases ended in a deportation order and 32.9 percent of the cases ended with a decision for the families to stay.Women and children with representation have been 14 times more likely to get relief in the cases decided so far. Advocates don't think this is because other families have a weaker case.""It is so difficult to navigate the system,"" said Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School and Kim's former professor.

They send out a list of things that need to be done -- translating interviews, preparing affidavits and drafting briefs -- and people pick up the different tasks.

Menjivar is undocumented, but is allowed to work and remain in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Her immigration lawyer is Laura Lichter, a past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association who has done extensive pro bono work at family detention facilities. When Menjivar told Lichter she wanted to find a way to help others, the attorney told her about the CARA project.Menjivar went to Dilley twice this summer to help prepare women for credible fear interviews, where immigration authorities determine whether they can move forward in seeking asylum or other relief. She isn't a lawyer, but was able to do intake and talk to the women, and she's planning to do more remote work, such as interpreting over the phone. A graduate of the University of Denver, Menjivar said the work in Dilley is an outgrowth of her efforts to encourage other undocumented immigrants to attend college like she did. She eventually wants to get a master's degree.""I focused on empowering youth when I was [at the University of Denver], and now I'm making that transition from just trying to help immigrant youth to doing some of the bigger things -- like trying to find out why are women being compelled to make that dangerous trek from their countries of origin to the United States,"" Menjivar said.  Some fellowship programs, such as Immigrant Justice Corps, also support free legal services for immigrants. The New York-based organization, launched a year ago, enables law school and four-year university graduates to spend two years doing immigration work -- basically, it's a Teach for America-like program for immigration law.

4,ARTS & CULTURE,"A Tiger Posed In An Abandoned Factory, Or When Ruin Photography Becomes Exploitation",Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tiger-packard-plant-ruin-porn-david-yarrow_us_55da7126e4b04ae49703883d,"Should artists use Detroit's urban decay as their ""canvas""?",2015-08-24,"<p>Tiger brought to the Packard Plant in Detroit for a photo shoot on August 17, 2015.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55da8ae81d00002f0014597d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A viral story about a tiger getting loose during a photo shoot in an abandoned Detroit factory was untrue and overblown, photographer David Yarrow said, but the incident has still sparked criticism in the local art world.Video posted on social media last week showed Tony Barchock, a Detroit-based photographer helping with the England-based Yarrow’s shoot, shaking a noisy weed wacker at a tiger in a stairwell of the Packard Plant.Although some reports indicated Barchock was doing this to force the escaped animal back in its cage, he said the nonviolent tactic was actually an attempt, at trainers’ instructions, to make the leashed tiger continue moving down the stairs. The trainers, Barchock and Yarrow have all insisted the animal was safely chained during the entire shoot.The Packard Plant is a crumbling, 3.5 million-square-foot former auto factory that was recently purchased by a developer and is in the process of renovation.Yarrow booked the building for two days, but was kicked out last Monday morning after several hours of shooting when Packard Plant Project Director of Development Kari Smith learned the crew was using not only the tiger, but two wolves and another wildcat. She told The Huffington Post she had signed off on the shoot but was not aware that animals would be present, and said the setting wasn't safe for wildlife. Yarrow said in a statement last week that his team did have city officials’ permission to bring in animals and use them in their shoots, which a city spokesman confirmed to the Detroit Free Press.Some have protested possible mistreatment of the tiger and other animals, but Yarrow stressed his commitment to conservation in his statement, saying he “uses his imagery to draw attention for the critical need to protect our wildlife” and that animals in his shoots are “cared for by the very best and respected animal experts in the world.”Many people criticized the idea of using a building that’s often served as a shortcut symbol of Detroit’s decline as a backdrop for a wild animal photo shoot.“At the end of the day, it’s exploitative,” said Tiff Massey, a Detroit artist. “It seems like everybody wants to come to the Packard Plant or [other popular abandoned buildings], and that’s what used to define Detroit and what’s happening. They’ll never show the neighborhood that’s sitting behind it.” Yarrow, a wildlife photographer, conservationist and hedge fund manager, told HuffPost he and his team spent several days photographing in the city. The shoots with animals were only a small portion of the work they did during an otherwise uneventful trip.He said he believed what happened during the Packard Plant shoot had been misconstrued because a resentful former staffer tried to “get a social media storm going.”Barchock quit the project after the team was forced to leave the Packard Plant. But the photographer, who does work with an animal rescue organization, said he hadn't wanted to publicize the incident himself, and said he wasn’t happy with how he came across in the video that had been shot and spread around social media.Barchock agreed that the shoot had been misrepresented in reports.“Nothing ever was out of control, the tiger just got tired and didn’t want to move,” Barchock said, adding that “for such a high-production thing, with animals and people and the locations involved, it was just very unorganized.”Barchock spent several weeks coordinating with Yarrow's team and helped select the Packard Plant and other locations, per their specifications. Model Gia Genevieve and several local men were used in the shoot along with the animals, Barchock said. “It’s a great canvas on which to paint, Detroit,” Yarrow said Friday. “It would have been nice to do more work against some of the canvas, of the iconic buildings.”Massey, whose recent sculpture work deals in part with reverse white flight, said she feels her majority black city is becoming a “white wonderland.”“I think it basically goes along with the new narrative … that you can do whatever you want to do here, it doesn’t matter who you are, where you are -- if you have the money, the land is hot and ready for the taking,"" she said. “There’s a total disregard for the natives.”Vince Carducci, an art and culture critic and dean of undergraduate studies for Detroit’s College for Creative Studies, compared Yarrow’s shoot to colonialist ideas and said he was tired of artists constantly using a former auto factory to make a point about post-industrialism.“The whole idea of Detroit as kind of this wilderness, jungle, post-Modernity [symbol] is, for those of us who live here, really kind of miscast,” he said. “It’s kind of the way Europeans romanticize some kind of primordial wilderness, the noble savage ... that idea is 300 years old.” Yarrow disagreed with the charge that the shoot was exploitative for including images of urban decay, a pervasive presence in Detroit. “Maybe on that basis, [the Eminem movie] ‘Eight Mile’ was exploitative,” he said. “I think ‘Eight Mile’ was good for the city, so why should we be doing anything different?”Yarrow has previously worked with ruins, shooting a wolf and models in a Montana ghost town for photos that appear in a section of his site titled ""Story Telling.""The Packard Plant has long been an irresistible destination for urban explorers, skiers, dirt bikers, graffiti-writers, ravers, scrappers and squatters, not to mention photographers, installation artists, bands and filmmakers. It appears as the dystopian setting of a number of movie projects, including a Korean boy band’s music video, a steampunk short film and “Transformers: Dark of the Moon.”But where some see beauty or an inspiring backdrop, others see harmfully romanticized views of urban decay and “ruin porn.”Dora Apel, art historian and author of the recently published Beautiful Terrible Ruins: Detroit and the Anxiety of Decline, said she finds the “porn” label unhelpful and instead focuses on how imagery is used politically and culturally. Throughout history, artists have made images of ruins as an attempt to control their anxiety about ruins by fetishizing them and making them aesthetically pleasing, said Apel -- something she views as a natural human impulse. But what happens when the fetishized view is continually perpetuated, and photographs of Detroit’s abandoned buildings outnumber and obscure actual residents?Work like Yarrow’s “feeds into a global idea of Detroit that really doesn’t have much to do with the real effects of poverty and the disenfranchisement of people living here,” Apel said. “The poor who are the victims of ruination bear the brunt of it, and bear the cost of it.”Also on HuffPost:"

O’Malley’s comments seemed to be a slight against two of his presidential opponents, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and progressive challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

""All I can say is, if I were Hillary, I would say [to Biden], 'Don't jump in.' If I were Joe Biden, I'd probably give it very serious consideration,"" Brown told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Sunday.Brown predicted that the controversy surrounding Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state could continue to haunt her campaign, and that her current status as the front-runner could change.""I don't make these expectations. I've been around politics long enough to know that, you know, that things are uncertain. I don't know,"" he said. “There’s always an opening for the outsider,” Brown added.On Saturday, CNN and The New York Times reported that Biden met with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to seek her input regarding a presidential run, further fueling speculation that he might jump into the race.As he ponders whether to dip his toe into the 2016 waters, Biden has reportedly reached out to potential campaign donors and discussed the matter with a small group of advisers.

But if headlining a film is what makes someone a movie star, then Tomlin is only now earning her due. And if top billing on a series makes someone a television star, then Tomlin didn't accomplish that either, until just a few months ago. Now she has a lot to show for it: Her film, ""Grandma,"" which opened this weekend, has attracted glowing reviews and Oscar buzz since it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, and the first season of her Netflix series, ""Grace and Frankie,"" led to Tomlin's umpteenth Emmy salute. ""I’ve never thought of myself as a movie star,"" Tomlin said when I sat down with her at a Manhattan hotel during the Tribeca Film Festival, where ""Grandma"" screened in April. ""I’m considered a little eccentric in a way."" It's not hard to pinpoint the origins of Tomlin's self-assessment: Her breakout stint on ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In"" in the early 1970s included such characters as fast-talking, nasally 5-year-old Edith Ann and the condescending telephone operator Ernestine. She smoked pot with Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton in the 1980 feminist comedy ""9 to 5"" and became a fixture of Robert Altman's sprawling ensemble films about the idiosyncrasies of the American experience (""Nashville,"" ""Short Cuts,"" ""A Prairie Home Companion""). ""Grandma"" fits in nicely with that catalog. Tomlin portrays a crusty, weed-smoking lesbian poet who assists her teenage granddaughter in cobbling together $600 for an abortion. And in ""Grace and Frankie,"" she plays a breezy, weed-smoking painter whose longtime husband leaves her for another man.These eccentricities don't always extend to Tomlin's real life, however, as much as her reputation may assume otherwise. She and Fonda, who portray ""Grace and Frankie's"" title characters, did take peyote to prepare for a pilot's hallucinogenic scene, but Tomlin has repeated time and again throughout the ""Grandma"" press cycle that she rarely smokes pot and certainly doesn't consume heavier drugs with any regularity. (""I’m too wacky and nutty and foggy anyway,"" she told The Daily Beast. ""I don’t need to get too blissed out."")What does factor into Tomlin's real life is the excellence of her ""Grandma"" performance, which the actress said is the closest she's come to playing herself onscreen. ""I don’t know why I didn’t think of this a long time ago,"" she said of portraying a semi-analogue. ""I identified with many things in the script: the fact that she was a lesbian. I’m not a poet, but I kind of wish I was.""I told Tomlin that comedy could be considered a form of poetry. She beamed.""Well, that’s true,"" she responded. ""Thank you! Bless you. You sound like Diane Keaton. She said, 'Comedy deserves something good,' and then she got an Oscar for 'Annie Hall.'"" Part of the reason ""Grandma"" hit home may be that Paul Weitz, who directed her in the 2013 Tina Fey-Paul Rudd comedy ""Admission,"" wrote the script with Tomlin in mind. (The same goes for ""Grace and Frankie,"" which ""Friends"" scribe Marta Kauffman co-created for Fonda and Tomlin.) She's shared the screen with the likes of Bette Midler (""Big Business"") and Steve Martin (""All of Me""), but this is the first movie in which Tomlin is the one true lead. At 75, that sounds like a feat, especially when she reveals that ""not very many"" scripts drift her way anymore. ""It’s an age thing for me right now,"" she said when I asked why more casting directors aren't ringing her up. ""What’s going to come across your desk is not going to be a lead role, and you’re not going to be a romantic interest in a conventional movie. I didn’t get a romantic lead when I was 30, though. I was thought of as a comedian.""She doesn't see herself as the lead of ""Grandma"" either, though. Tomlin was ""over the moon"" when she learned that Julia Garner had been cast as her granddaughter, Marcia Gay Harden as her stuffy daughter, Judy Greer as a doting ex-girlfriend and Laverne Cox as a tattoo-artist pal. Oh, and she got to clobber ""Paper Towns"" star Nat Wolff with a hockey stick in one scene, too. But ""Grandma"" is Tomlin's movie. Perhaps she's taking a modesty cue from her own mother. I asked whether the film's family dynamics resonate, and Tomlin launched into an account about sometimes needing to act as a parental figure while growing up. Like that time she called a door-to-door salesman who'd duped her mother, too intimidated to tell him no, into purchasing 10 vacuum cleaners at about $300 a pop. She ordered him to come to their home and refund her mother's money. ""I was all piss and vinegar,"" she recalled. ""I was just cursing him and telling him that if he didn’t come I would throw it in the street. He finally came out and said, 'Your mother bought that vacuum cleaner' and all this stuff. And I pitched it out off the stairs. I was forever doing stuff like that. I just railed against it. In the early years, my mother would have been more concerned about what the neighbors -- or the relatives in the South -- would think. I was a Detroit kid, a street kid, so I was kind of tough. I would stand up for myself.""That resolve worked in Tomlin's favor over the years, including the many times she's said she has no regrets about turning down an offer to reveal her sexuality on the cover of Time magazine in 1975. The same forces that prevented her from accepting the deal -- potential career suicide at the time -- would have stymied a pro-choice, pro-weed, pro-sexuality, pro-aging movie like ""Grandma"" from being made even a decade ago. ""I just feel like so much progress has been made on those fronts, although a lot has been a pull-back, too, in certain regions,"" she said. ""And I know that because my family is Southern. My generation has come around tremendously. My mom’s generation, they’d just be negative, negative, negative: 'Did you hear about that Mary Jean?' That's my real name. My mother would be 100 years old by now, and even though my mother came to terms with my brother and me both being gay, my relatives would have been gossiping about us for days. But my younger relatives are much more lenient, much more tolerant, much more accepting. Their minds are just open to things. And yet I can’t even talk about this in a way because so much other stuff is so horrible in the world -- the inequities and the prejudice and the hate and the killing."" She's right, of course, but ""Grandma"" is a phenomenal signpost of the incremental progress this country has seen in recent years. It's also one of the year's best indies to date -- a yarn about old connections resurfacing and disparate generations merging their value systems. In an ideal world, Tomlin would add an Oscar nomination to her list of 2015 successes. After our 20-minute chat, the publicist said it was time to part. I instantly protested, not wanting to end a great conversation. Tomlin stood and threw her arms around me for a hug. She would never admit it, but somewhere, she must know, 44 years after her first Emmy nomination, that this is her moment.  ""Grandma"" is now in limited release.
