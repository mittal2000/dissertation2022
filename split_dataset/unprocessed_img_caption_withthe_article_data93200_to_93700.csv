Observed in 162 countries in 2014, the event is about ""coming together to create a symbolic and spectacular lights out display and asking for change,"" according to parent organization World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

(Richard Stonehouse for WWF/Earth Hour Globa via AP Images)WWF partnered with the the ad agency Leo Burnett in 2007 to launch the first Earth Hour, in Sydney, Australia. ""The idea was born out of frustration,"" co-founder Andy Ridley said in 2009. ""We wanted to start something that isn't focused on people's despair at the long-term climate change problems the human race is facing. We wanted something really positive.""Ridley and WWF both acknowledge that Earth Hour isn't about saving energy while the lights are off. Naysayers have seized on this to 'debunk' the event, while free-market advocates have started their own ""Human Achievement Hour"" as a ""counter argument.""Yet even if Earth Hour is purely symbolic -- or a gimmick, as some might argue -- the world stands to benefit from greater awareness of the threat of climate change.Antarctica's land-based ice sheets are melting and increasingly contributing to global sea level rise. Scientists project up to several feet of sea level rise for parts of the United States this century, while poorer countries face an existential threat from rising tides.2014 was the warmest year on record for the planet and global greenhouse gas emissions remain high.Other recent efforts to raise awareness, including last September's People's Climate March in New York City, have emphasized the importance of the United Nations' upcoming conference on climate change in Paris later this year. Policy experts warn that the Paris conference may be the last meaningful chance for the international community to reach an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stave off the worst impacts of climate change.Earth Hour takes place from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. in your local time zone.

Go to a local happy hour and work on learning a new language over a pint. Make friends by sharing a meal or renting a room in a local home. Research volunteer experiences and homestays.",2015-03-28,2015-03-27-1427479958-5239019-NickPeruwithLocalLadiesinCuzco.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-27-1427479958-5239019-NickPeruwithLocalLadiesinCuzco-thumb.jpg,"If a picture is worth 1,000 words, what is an experience worth? The experiences of travel are what make one's journey priceless. The memories of these experiences are what make travel last forever.Perhaps this is because I have been to 85 countries, but when I travel, it's no longer stunning sites that fuel my wanderlust, but rather the connections that I make with local people. I cherish the memories I have of making new friends from around the world while immersing myself in local culture that makes an area genuine and unique. Modern travelers seem to seek these experiences as well. In 2014, the travel industry was abuzz about the possibilities of experiential travel: living like a local (or even better, with a local), taking cooking classes, volunteering, and more. Today's travelers seek more than amenities and creature comforts, more than getting their picture taken on the Golden Gate Bridge or under the Eifel Tower, and more than quick stops at crowded monuments and museums and a quick stop by the gift shop for baubles. Real experiences - real connections - are what compel people to travel.I began to see the benefits of ""going local"" at an early age. During my childhood, my parents and I traveled from San Francisco to Greece each summer. In Greece, I learned to bake bread when I was 12 years old. When we ate at restaurants, they were authentic and frequented almost exclusively by locals. The experience of cooking and eating with family and friends in Greece has profoundly shaped my outlook on travel, food, and culture. Because of my upbringing and experiences, this ""new"" phenomenon of experiential travel seems natural to me. Doesn't everyone want to live like a local when they travel? Doesn't everyone want to learn to cook a wonderful seafood risotto in Bologna, to visit a coffee shop or a happy hour among a city's real inhabitants, and to hike off the beaten path on a remote island in the Azores? Seeking out and engaging in an unfamiliar culture is what travel is all about. There are so many ways to ""go local."" When I was younger, and backpacking in Athens, I spent a week sleeping on a local family's roof and eating meals in their home. This was a great way for a 18-year-old to save money and learn from a native family an amazing city.Amazing things can happen when you immerse yourself in local culture. I was at a ultra-cool, Polynesian themed Tiki Bar, Sugar Cane in Clapham, London, when I met Alex and Jenny, art enthusiasts, and fellow fans of uncommon, inebriating watering holes. After many a fruity rum drink and shots of tequila (bad combination), my newfound friends invited me to their home for supper. The next night, I ate a most memorable meal of canard Ã  l'orange in their Mayfair home. What better way to make friends than over a home-cooked meal and bottle or two of wine? My experience in Alex and Jenny's welcoming home is unforgettable.On another trip to London for the annual World Travel Market, my wife and I met a wonderful couple, Dave and Jen, that managed a bar in the London neighborhood of Acton. Oddly enough, we had met over social media - LinkedIn and Facebook. My wife and I were lucky to meet our new friends in person and stay in a room above their pub, The George & Dragon. I would come back from a hard day's work at the travel convention, explore the new neighborhood around the pub, and afterwards, go behind the bar and pour myself a pint of Guinness. My hosts were amazing; the experience of sleeping above their bar will be etched in my mind forever. My chance online encounter with this couple, and other coincidental encounters like it, can make travel experiences unbelievable. Today, online resources make going local easier than ever before. Far before Airbnb, I lived abroad with relatives and friends, and even ""couch surfed"" in the homes of locals that I did not know. Now, there are now websites dedicated to every aspect of experiential travel. You can stay in a real French home, help build homes in Africa, assist marine biologists in Thailand, and even take cooking classes in Tuscany. There are so many ways to blend into your new stomping ground using technology. You may know that you can stay in a local's home using Airbnb. Another great service, homeexchange.com, allows you to swap homes with another traveler and exchange your amazing travel experience for theirs. And through couchsurfing.com you can stay on someone's living room couch or in a spare room very economically. While using any of these services, your new neighbors during your stay can be wonderful sources of information and help you blend into local society. Living in a local home or apartment can change your perspective of a new place in a profound and meaningful way and make traveling anywhere in the world a one-of-a-kind social experience.Another opportunity for unique experiences abroad is sharing meals. Food sharing sites like eatwith.com, mealsharing.com, and festly.com connect travelers with local hosts to experience home-cooked meals. These sites are all about immersing oneself in local society and culture. Ten years ago, hardly any of us were self-proclaimed foodies. Now, local cuisine has become an important factor in choosing travel destinations. In the last decade, some chefs have skyrocketed to celebrity status. Travelers now often seek vacations in beautiful and relaxing locations, but the focal point of a journey is to experience the local gastronomy. Consider the timeless and refined cuisines of Paris, Rome, and Athens. Combining a culinary excursion with the richness of a historical destination can make for a wonderful holiday experience.You can also immerse yourself in another culture through volunteering. There are so many ways to make the world a better place, and what greater satisfaction is there than knowing that you're making a positive difference in a new place? International Student Volunteers (ISV) works with grassroots initiatives to offer volunteer projects in Costa Rica. ISV volunteer programs directly benefit the local communities of Costa Rica and offer a wide range of volunteer positions in wildlife conservation, community development, children's programs, and environmental management. However you wish to make an impact, there is a volunteer project for you with ISV in Costa Rica. There are also many other volunteer experiences elsewhere. You can travel to save tigers in Taman Negara, or turtles on the Perhentian Islands in Malaysia. Wherever you go, GoOverseas.com offers the experience living with a local family while you volunteer. The possibilities to make the world a better place are endless.The next time you travel, truly experience a new place. Go to a local happy hour and work on learning a new language over a pint. Make friends by sharing a meal or renting a room in a local home. Research volunteer experiences and homestays. Richer, more authentic travels further the international community, enrich the senses, make travel more fulfilling, and truly make the world a better place."

These women -- who put themselves out there in a one minute pitch -- will attend the Johnson & Johnson Human Performance Institute in Orlando, FL and train with coaches, receiving tools and resources for professional and personal transformations. On April 10, they will showcase their newfound skills and confidence onstage and under the lights to compete for a $10,000 bonus. The ""Grow Your Value"" bonus competition drives home the message that it is important for women to both learn their value and communicate it effectively. This will be a profound journey that we will take with our finalists, learning from them along the way.Meet the finalists:It was tough to choose three finalists among dozens of submissions from strong and impressive women, but I was especially moved by Joanna, Ashton and Denise. A counselor with a big heart, an ambitious small business owner and an HR professional who wants to improve the lives of veterans are our finalists competing for the $10,000 bonus!Joanna Schwartz, 36, of Passyunk Square, PA is a holistic family counselor and founder of ""Toolbox for Teachers"" -- a program created to offer educators strategies in mindfulness and stress relief to combat the mental rigors of teaching. Her 60-second submission video struck me as incredibly sincere. ""I could really use your help with my self-confidence,"" she told me. Let's face it: Joanna is not alone. We could ALL use a similar boost in how we see and present ourselves.Just weeks after graduating college, Ashton Sweitzer, 25, of Lancaster County, PA opened Glitz, a boutique in Lititz, PA that sells a variety of women's accessories. Ashton is determined to contribute in a meaningful way to her community -- but as a small business owner, she faces a growing mountain of challenges. As a ""Grow Your Value"" finalist, she will hone her leadership skills as well as compete for that bonus to further invest in her business.A human resources professional of 12 years, Denise Uzzelle of Lancaster, Texas launched her own company, Starting Point Human Capital Advisors, with the mission of helping our veterans retain their jobs. As the wife of a disabled veteran, Denise sees a growing need for us to invest in the professional futures of those who serve. She's competing so she can make a difference in veterans' lives.I'm beyond inspired by these wonderful women, and I am excited to see the transformations they will make.Know Your Value on April 10:I can't wait to see the finalists again on April 10 -- after their exciting transformations at the Human Performance Institute. You won't want to miss the kickoff Know Your Value event, featuring interactive panels, individual coaching sessions, and inspiring discussions with many people I admire.

It's everywhere. Often not even beeped out of television shows, ""bitch"" is in rap songs and pop songs and on t-shirts. ""It's Britney, bitch."" ""I'm in Miami, bitch.""",2015-03-28,Women whispering Grouped elements Color Illustrator Ver. 5 Have you heard Listen to this,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6029324000032005696fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, I called myself a bitch. It was shorthand, really. I had an unpleasant exchange with a male banker and left feeling that the only way to be taken seriously was to act like a bitch. In writing about the experience, what I found most interesting in people's responses (aside from the majority of online commentators basically telling me to shut up and stop complaining) was how many female friends bumped up against my use of the word bitch.In part, I wrote: ""It's second nature for women to switch into bitchy, bossy, don't-fuck-with-me-mode, because how often are we spoken to differently than the man standing next to us? How often do I have to raise my voice to be taken seriously?""A coworker emailed me: ""Unless you were flipping desks or threatening to get these dudes fired, you weren't acting bitchy -- you were acting professional.""She's right. So I thought about the word. And I thought more about the word. It's everywhere. Often not even beeped out of television shows, ""bitch"" is in rap songs and pop songs and on t-shirts. ""It's Britney, bitch."" ""I'm in Miami, bitch."" For millenials, the word has become a replacement for the exclamation mark.But it also has roots deeply established in feminism and every woman I've talked to has a different relationship with the word -- depending on the situation. Like the often-wrongly cited example of how many different words Eskimos have for ""snow,"" bitch seems to have just as many meanings.I took out a pen and paper and tried to breakdown the word.BITCH: a. Bossy; to bitch someone around.b. Complaining; bitching and moaning.c. Inferior; to be someone's bitch, acting like a little bitch.d. Overly emotional or moody; she has her period and is acting like a total bitch.e. Aggressive; that bitch just pushed to the front of the line.f. Rude; what a bitch...she didn't even say hello.As one friend put it, sometimes people are mean and we need a word to describe them -- like ""asshole"" or ""jerk."" Sometimes bitch is just a synonym. But where bitch gets interesting is when it's used to illustrate power and control within genders. Easy example: a man doesn't act manly enough, or fails to exert power, and he is called a bitch. A woman has too much power or control and she is called a bitch. I think we assume that if a woman is any of the things listed above (bossy, aggressive, rude), then people will think she's a bitch. This may be the case. But I called myself a bitch. Why? As a reminder, I didn't flip one desk.I was assertive. I was confident. I was logical. I explained that their repeated mistakes were unacceptable. I was clear. Here's what I wasn't: I wasn't bubbly. I wasn't helpless. I wasn't doting. I wasn't meek. I wasn't flirtatious. I wasn't charmed and I wasn't charming.  Yet somehow, leaving the bank, I had taken this social perception of expressing displeasure and replaced it with the word bitch. Was this conditioning so engrained within me? Had it been so keenly absorbed that I couldn't even feel its presence? Is it the same reason women chronically ask for less raises than men do? The same reason we're still paid 77 cents when a man makes a dollar? Are we so viscerally uncomfortable with asking for what we want that we cloak our discomfort in words like bossy, bitchy and cunt?Gloria Steinem said, ""A woman who aspires to be something is called a bitch.""I was born right smack in the middle of the 1980s. I was raised to believe that I could be anything I wanted if I worked hard. I still believe that. Believing that it's okay to ask for what I want -- and expecting to be treated equally -- are things that sound so antiquated. But they're not. I bet the banker from last week and the bankers from the weeks before do not even remember our exchanges. But what I learned, while they fumbled through their antique word processors, is that it's not unpretty or unfeminine to be assertive. In the words of my mother, it's actually pretty bitchin'."

Jordan: Entrepreneurship is the capability to fearlessly face challenges with persistence, while staying positive and adapting your approach constantly by listening to your clients' needs. The characteristics required are tenacity, passion and charisma. I find that a contagious excitement for what you're striving to achieve invites people to collaborate with you in a fun, yet professional way.

It was surreal to be listed alongside Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Lorde and other superstars! I would have loved to start a business in college...any business, just to get my feet wet and start my experience from a younger age.Q: Tell us about an instance where you had to go against the flow to realize your goal. Jordan: In 2010, I was told by countless people that I was taking a huge gamble by building out a website to connect musicians and music buyers. My goal was not to prove them wrong, but rather to follow through and execute what I set out to do. Q: If Mozart were born today, where would he be working in the music industry?Jordan: Mozart, and all of the great composers of his era for that matter, would be film composers who also write for video games, TV shows, advertising and trailers. The genius composers of today are spreading their musical talents and are less consumed with focusing on one sector of the business. At SCORE A SCORE, we also believe it's very important to make the best music you can, and succeed wherever you can!Q: LinkedIn style - If you were to give advice to your 22 year old self, what would it be? Jordan: I started my business at 22, so this is a great question! I would advise myself to embrace feedback from smart peers, but not to let criticisms inhibit the ability to dream huge.

Harry Reid ushered in the most important changes to Senate procedure in a generation.Sen. Reid's announced retirement in 2016 has already led to many retrospectives about the legacy he will leave when he returns to Nevada. A major chapter will be his work to return the Senate to its tradition of providing up-or-down votes on most presidential nominees. It will be titled the ""Reid Rule.""In the fall of 2013, under Sen. Reid's leadership, a majority of senators -- old bulls like Iowa's former Sen. Tom Harkin, new voices like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and independents like Sen. Angus King of Maine -- voted to set a new precedent: No longer could 41-out-of-100 senators wield veto power over every presidential nomination.The Senate acted in the wake of unprecedented obstruction: Republicans at the time were blocking up-or-down votes on appellate judges, high-level administration officials and even a member of Congress nominated to lead an agency. Those leading the blockade were transparent about their motives: They had no problems with the credentials of many of these nominees; they just wanted to leave some vacancies unfilled. And so they invoked the 60-vote filibuster rule over-and-over again, which essentially allowed a minority of 41 senators to grind everything to a halt.In the aftermath of Sen. Reid's decision to end filibusters on most nominations, the Senate confirmed more than 385 nominees to courts and executive agencies, rendering hollow the hyperbolic claims that eliminating the filibuster for most nominations would destroy civilization as we know it. If Sen. Reid had not acted, entire government offices would have ceased to function and the judicial branch would have had even more vacancies than it does today, delaying justice for thousands of Americans.Eliminating the 60-vote rule for most nominees cut-off the ability of a small faction of senators to shut down agencies and nullify laws they oppose by depriving government of a functioning staff.Of course, a senator can still vote against a nominee on the merits -- but no longer can a senator require a 60-vote supermajority before the rest of the Senate exercises its right to provide advice and consent on a nomination.Still, senators who prefer gridlock have plenty of tools at their disposal. In the aftermath of the Reid Rule, they quickly invented a new tool of obstruction: the slow walk. Before the Republicans took back the Senate earlier this year, they spent much of 2014 demanding superfluous, time-wasting cloture votes and dragging out the clock, spending days on a single nominee even if the nominee enjoyed unanimous support. Now, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is using his control of the Senate floor to block a confirmation vote for Attorney General-nominee Loretta Lynch. No longer able to cite a lack of 60 votes as an excuse, Sen. McConnell claims that the Senate is too busy to provide its advice and consent on a potential member of the President's cabinet. Ms. Lynch has waited longer than the last seven attorneys general - combined. These sorts of partisan games are profoundly harmful to a functioning democracy. Nominees who put themselves forward for public service -- and the Americans they will serve -- should not pay the price of indefinite limbo because a few squabbling politicians are upset with the consequences of an election or unrelated legislation. They deserve the courtesy of at least receiving a yes or no from the United States Senate.Senator Reid's legacy will include his efforts to restore the Senate's constitutional role as the provider of advice and consent on nominees. But it still takes senators who are willing to fulfill their obligation to do their job - and voters to hold accountable those who do otherwise.[This piece is adapted from an earlier blog  by the author posted on The Hill on the first-year anniversary of the Senate's rule change.]"

Greece's new radical government celebrated Independence Day with a crowd-friendly military parade and folk music, a move that has met with some criticism at home.

But Tsipras said Varoufakis was ""one of the key members of the government."" CHINA AND RUSSIAAs Greece races to agree to raise funds, Deputy Prime Minister Yannis Dragasakis told China's official Xinhua news agency that Athens will sell its majority stake in the port of Piraeus within weeks, a flip-flop from its previous position. Speaking during a visit by Greek officials to China, Dragasakis hinted that Chinese firm Cosco Group - short-listed in a process launched by the previous center-right government - was a front runner for the state's 67 percent stake.And as Greece seeks to fill its state coffers, the Russian ambassador to Athens told Kathimerini newspaper that Moscow would examine any loan request from Greece, were it to be made.Tsipras is due to visit Moscow on April 8 for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin but the Greek government has stressed it is not seeking funding from the Kremlin. On Saturday, Greece's energy ministry said Lafazanis will meet Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Gazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller on Monday in the capital, a week before Tsipras is due to arrive.The previous center-right government had planned to accelerate the sale of a 65 percent stake in gas utility DEPA, after an initial attempt to sell to Gazprom in 2013 failed. Within days of Syriza taking power in January, Lafazanis said he would scrap the sale.DEPA has previously negotiated with Gazprom in a bid to get cheaper gas supplies and was one of the first European companies to obtain a rebate in 2011.The two countries, which are both Orthodox Christian, have traditionally had good relations and Athens has never strongly supported sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.

On the bright side, the insurance industry has nimbly adjusted to other new technologies in recent years, Barry said.He pointed to new programs created for drivers at car-hailing services, allowing them to get a dual policy that separately covers time spent driving for personal and commercial use.âThe auto insurance industry has adapted to technological changes in the past, and will continue to do so in the future,â Barry said. âLook at whatâs going on with Uber and Lyft.âOverall, he predicted that driverless cars will eventually lead to fewer crashes. But it's still far from clear who will actually be responsible if and when a crash does occur.âLiability is going to become an issue,â Barry said. âThe burden might be on the manufacturer of the driverless vehicle to prove that it is not responsible for what happened in the event of a crash.âTeslaâs autopilot feature will only be available on interstate highways, as CEO Elon Musk has said the technology is not yet âsafe on suburban streets.âFully automated vehicles are still a ways off from becoming the norm. If a circumstance arises where an accident is unavoidable -- say, for instance, a child runs out into the street -- the computers that control the car do not yet have the ethical reasoning to deduce whether they should sacrifice the driver by suddenly swerving away, or run down the child. Last September, Ron Medford, Googleâs safety chief on its driverless car project, said the company had not yet begun to study that issue. Either way, even when self-driving cars do become widely available, the rate of turnover in the U.S. car market will delay their widespread adoption. âThe average car on the road is about 11 years old, so it takes decades for the U.S. fleet to turn over,â Barry said. âI think weâre far away from seeing a lot of driverless cars on the roadways.â "

Mike Pence (R), does not explicitly mention discrimination against gays or anyone else. Rather, it ""prohibits state or local governments from substantially burdening a person's ability to exercise their religion,"" according to The Indianapolis Star. But critics say the bill could give businesses a legal foothold to refuse service to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals in the name of religious freedom.Barkley's remarks echo the NCAA's own position, which President Mark Emmert voiced Thursday in a prepared statement.""The NCAA national office and our members are deeply committed to providing an inclusive environment for all our events,"" said Emmert.

His thoughts soon turned to a decision he made in his 20s, when he reluctantly entered a career path and profession that his father urged him to follow. He said he now saw that his need for parental approval back then was part of a larger pattern that also led him into a marriage with the ""wrong"" partner. ""I feel so much regret, about how foolish I was not to listen to my own heart - if I even knew what it was back then."" Throughout the decades I've heard many men and women express similar laments about turning points in their lives - significant experiences or choices they made, which they look back upon with deep regret and feelings of entrapment. They tell me the sadness they feel about the direction they took and what they turned away from, especially when they see the consequences over time that they feel entrapped by. However, it's possible to experience your regrets differently. Those regrets have likely taught you something about yourself and changed you. But you may not realize it. And, you may not have acted upon what's changed within you, as you go forward in your life today. To explain, lets first take a look at two examples of people's regrets and how they can paralyze one's present life: The woman who dropped out of graduate school when she was offered an entry-level editorial job with a newspaper. She was attracted by the seeming security of the position, and she said she had doubts about her journalistic skills, anyway. She remained with the paper for many years, while feeling increasingly stagnated. Ultimately, she was let go during a retrenchment. Now, at midlife, in a tight job market and an unforgiving life situation for people like her, she tells me, ""If only I has stayed in grad school, how different my life would have been. But now..."" She says she feels trapped and depressed about her life.There's the man who, similar to John, realizes that his fears of showing himself, of asserting himself in relationships, accompanied him into a marriage. There, he became subordinate and increasingly resentful. He remained in that marriage for years, while fearing to engage his wife to determine if it could be improved or if it should end. Interestingly, his pattern was illustrated by some new research showing that people who are insecure about themselves tend to stay in unhappy marriages. The study found that intimate partners who experience low self-esteem to begin with tend to remain in their relationships, not making ""noise,"" for fear of rejection. They avoid facing or addressing problems in the marriage. And then, unhappiness and conflict become almost inevitable. There are many kinds of regrets that people have and then feel trapped by within their current lives. That becomes more acute as you enter the middle years. But consider this: If you're able to feel regret to begin with, then that very feeling, that awareness, suggests that you're probably not the same person you were back then. That is, if you're able to recognize the ""wrong"" path you took, you're likely to have grown and ""evolved"" beyond it, since then. Otherwise you wouldn't be aware of the consequences or what you've come to regret. From that perspective, you have an opportunity to identify what you've learned from those experiences and consequences. That can be the key to freedom from feeling trapped by your ""previous"" self, because you have become a different person, in those respects, as you go forward. Perhaps most importantly, you may have ""needed"" to follow the ""wrong"" path in order to confront and learn something important about yourself; something essential for your capacity to grow and change. It is sort of a message to the self from the self: ""This is what you need to deal with in your life, in order to grow.""With today's perspective, you can identify what you weren't able to recognize, foresee or understand back then. That can show you what you need to incorporate now, both in your view of yourself and your current actions. That includes forgiving yourself for having followed the ""wrong"" path. This shift of perspective can alter your experience of regrets towards a healthier, positive direction. But there's also a reality to embrace, here; It's living with the ""long tail"" of the consequences of your past decisions. That includes any events you might not have chosen, but happened to you. Facing what you can do now, with awareness of how you are different, today, includes living in the context of that ""long tail."" However, living with the consequences of the past doesn't mean you need to be imprisoned by them in your life now - unless you've learned nothing and are still the same person as you were back then, making the same kind of mistakes. In fact, embracing how you've grown and changed in your emotions and behavior, together with accepting whatever the long-term consequences of your regrets have been, can be liberating. It can free you to focus on what's important to your life right now and what you are able to change, in contrast to what you can't. You might not find a life situation concerning your relationship or your work that's as ideal as what might have been, had you had followed a different path. But it can be good and meaningful in its own right. Especially so, when you know that you have grown spiritually and emotionally. And anyway, keep in mind the always-unknown aspect of the path not taken: You don't really know what might have happened. If you had taken that ""better"" path it might have led to disaster... and another kind of regret.Photo credit: My Documented ClosetDouglas LaBier, Ph.D., is director of the Center for Progressive Development, and writes its blog, Progressive Impact. dlabier@CenterProgressive.org.

16,ARTS,Does Ballet Have a Color?,"Virginia Johnson, ContributorArtistic Director, Dance Theatre of Harlem",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/does-ballet-have-a-color_b_6951762.html,It is so odd to feel like an outsider on an issue that touched my life so profoundly and was at least a part of what Arthur Mitchell set out to address 46 years ago when he and Karel Shook cofounded The Dance Theatre of Harlem in the basement of a church in Harlem.,2015-03-28,2015-03-27-1427497824-3246135-DTHHuffPostVirginiaJohnson.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-27-1427497824-3246135-DTHHuffPostVirginiaJohnson-thumb.jpg," Photo by Rachel NevillePanel after panel convenes to ask why there are not more dancers of color in ballet. My heart sinks every time. Where is Dance Theatre of Harlem in this conversation? It is so odd to feel like an outsider on an issue that touched my life so profoundly and was at least a part of what Arthur Mitchell set out to address 46 years ago when he and Karel Shook cofounded DTH in the basement of a church in Harlem. Perhaps it's because, while DTH has always been a celebration of the richness of African American culture as well as the grand tradition of classical ballet, as a racially, ethnically, culturally diverse ballet company, we are not now -- and never have been -- about being an all-black ballet company. Arthur Mitchell created DTH to enable people to see this art form of ballet in a different way. He succeeded magnificently. The company he created caught the world's imagination. Now, five years after Arthur Mitchell passed the artistic reins on to me, the many preconceptions that get in the way of understanding why Dance Theatre of Harlem exists are all too clear to me. DTH is here to build an alternate future for this powerful and exquisite art form. The goal is to dispel the notion that ballet is exclusive to one culture or one group of people and to show that the intrinsic power of ballet as a dance form of expression is more than skin deep. The early years of DTH felt like an awakening. In 1969, I, with a handful of others, seized the opportunity Arthur Mitchell's vision offered and actually had the career in ballet that everyone had told us was not possible. Because of that, by 1979, young ballet dancers of color started walking into the studio knowing they belonged there. For the dancers and public alike, ballet was revealed in a new light. I don't think any of us actually realized what a grim day it was back in 2004 when DTH was forced to close down its touring company. For many of those company members, it was the end of their careers. Scant few found jobs in ballet and the pattern of exclusion resumed. Without examples to emulate, the stream of confident, accomplished dancers of color dried to a trickle. Forty years after Arthur Mitchell made a difference, dancers of color are again supplicants at the gate, begging to be accepted in an art form that literally can't see us and so will not let us in.It's a tough problem. American racial attitudes aside, nothing will change until those of us whose work is to keep this art form alive choose to define a new aesthetic for ballet in the 21st century. Only then will we begin to make this art form vital and relevant. We all know the story that when George Balanchine came to America to start a ballet company, he imagined it would be made up of six black dancers and six white. That never happened, but Balanchine did redefine the ballet aesthetic to create a company that was uniquely American. It was a brilliant step forward. It is time for the next step. Balanchine taught us to look at the human body in motion in a new way and, in the long relay race that is art, Arthur Mitchell, took the baton and carried it forward. The Dance Theatre of Harlem company returned to its work of bringing people together through art a little more than two years ago. And while the world has changed in many ways there is still a distance to go. Ballet is a complex and beautiful human endeavor the experience of which can change lives. Yes, ballet does have a color. It is the rich color of humanity -- in all of its shades. That's what Dance Theatre of Harlem is about -- opening minds to what is possible. See us at City Center April 8-11."

Physicists have long calculated the answer to that question as being 42 minutes, but now, new calculations show that the theoretical trip would actually take around 38 minutes -- and we can blame gravity for the discrepancy.The traditional calculation to measure a fall through Earth assumes that our planet has a constant density throughout its many layers. Since the gravitational attraction between two objects is proportional to their masses (or density) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, if Earth's density were constant, the only change in gravity we'd experience would be due to how far we were from Earth's center. But as Alexander Klotz, a graduate student at McGill University in Canada, came up with the new calculations, he took into consideration how Earth's density changes layer by layer. And as a result, the gravitational speed at which we would fall through each layer changed too. Klotz measured the different densities found in Earth's interior using seismic data. Indeed, our planet has a less dense crust and mantle and a more dense core, Science magazine reported.A paper describing the new thought experiment results was published in the March 2015 issue of the American Journal of Physics.""This is the kind of paper we love,"" Dr. David Jackson, editor of the journal and a physicist at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, told Science magazine. ""This is a nice addition to the classic problem.""Want to learn more about our planet's internal layers? Take a journey to the center of the Earth in the ""Talk Nerdy To Me"" video below."

Walker made his first trip to South Carolina on Thursday and is planning to meet with Republican governor, Nikki Haley. South Carolina hosts the first primary in the south. (Photo by Richard Ellis/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8efa3240000500098fd60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The 2016 presidential electionâs âinvisible primaryâ is in full swing as Republican candidates tour the country looking to secure donors for their real or potential campaigns and their super PACs.âTheyâre all beating the bush as youâd expect,â said David Herro, a wealthy Chicago-based investor who has contributed $1.5 million to Republican super PACs since 2010.Itâs âway too earlyâ to pick a candidate, according to Herro, but he does know which ones he wonât be backing. âI certainly donât want any of these extreme people,â Herro said, listing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who announced his presidential run on Monday, and former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.).While Herro may not have chosen a candidate yet, many other big-time donors to Republican presidential aspirants have. Though only limited details on those donors have leaked, the GOP primary campaign is already shaping up to be a clash between distinct groups of billionaires and millionaires.The financiers, lobbyists and longtime major party donors are largely supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Newer big-money donors aligned with the increasingly influential political machine run by the billionaire Koch brothers and those affiliated with more-conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund are lining up behind Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. The divide is evident in a review of super PAC contributions made so far by donors publicly associated with a 2016 candidate.For their part, the presidential wannabes are aiming to attract support from those most amenable to their policy positions, whether itâs the right-wing bomb throwing of Cruz or the apostasies of Bush on issues like education and immigration.Bush, who is only âactively exploringâ running for president, is garnering donations for his Right to Rise Super PAC from Wall Street private equity investors Henry Kravis, Alexander Navab and Ken Mehlman, who attended a $100,000-per-person event in New York that brought in at least $4 million. Chicago-based financiers Muneer Satter, Craig Duchossois, Ron Gidwitz and John Canning have all contributed to Bushâs nascent campaign. Florida investor Mike Fernandez said that he would cut a $1 million check to the Bush super PAC as part of a multimillion-dollar fundraiser he hosted for the former governor.Over the past three federal elections, these Bush backers all gave to mainstream Republican Party groups like Karl Roveâs American Crossroads, the pro-Mitt Romney Restore Our Future and the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is linked to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).On Wednesday, Jeb Bush was joined by his older brother, former President George W. Bush, at a fundraiser in Dallas. Attendees included such longtime Bush family backers -- and hefty super PAC check-writers -- as natural gas billionaire T. Boone Pickens, beer distributor John Nau, real estate developer Woody Hunt and oil producer Trevor Rees-Jones. The foursome were major supporters of the 2012 Senate campaign of Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, combining to give $475,000 to the pro-Dewhurst super PAC Texas Conservatives Fund. The establishment favorite lost to Ted Cruz, however, in an expensive runoff contest.Now, Cruz is gunning for Bush in the race for their partyâs presidential nomination. He's doing that with help from some of the same donors who lifted him into the Senate. When Cruz ran in 2012, he received massive outside support from the ultra-conservative Club for Growth. A thorn in the side of the GOP establishment, the group regularly strives to elect the more conservative Republican in primary elections. It spent $5.5 million to help Cruz defeat Dewhurst, more than it has spent on any other race before or since.Those hosting or scheduled to appear at fundraisers for Cruz since his Monday entrance into the White House race include some big Club for Growth donors. Immediately following his presidential announcement, the senator flew to New York, where he attended a fundraiser hosted by Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of hedge fund executive Bob Mercer. The daughter, who manages her familyâs charitable foundation, has given only $15,000 to the Club for Growthâs super PAC, but her father, who has not yet declared for a 2016 candidate, has been a top electoral donor with $1.75 million contributed since 2010.On March 31, Cruz will be the guest of honor at a Texas fundraiser where Club for Growth donors like Steven Pfeifer, Terrence Murphree, Graham Whaling, William Langston and Windi Grimes will be in attendance.Those already backing Cruz have also supported various sectarian conservative groups causing headaches for the party over the past few years. They've donated to the super PACs affiliated with FreedomWorks, Senate Conservatives Fund and Tea Party Patriots. These three groups and the Club for Growth intervened in numerous primary campaigns to challenge incumbents over the past three elections. One or more of them backed primary candidates against then-incumbent Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Richard Lugar (Ind.), John Cornyn (Texas), Thad Cochran (Miss.), Pat Roberts (Kan.), Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Bob Bennett (Utah).In nearly every case, Bush-backing donors were on the other side. Pro-Bush donors in Texas funded a super PAC called Texans for a Conservative Majority to help Cornyn beat back a challenge from hyper-conservative Rep. Steve Stockman in 2014. Lobbyist Richard Hohlt, a Bush supporter, gave $15,000 to Indiana Values SuperPAC, a pro-Lugar group, in 2012. And many Bush donors contributed liberally to both the pro-McConnell Kentuckians for Strong Leadership and the pro-Cochran Mississippi Conservatives super PACs in 2014.Balancing atop this donor divide, though, is Scott Walker. Thanks to his frontal assault on labor unions, the greatest perceived enemy of the wealthy conservative donor class, and the three very expensive elections he has survived in the past five years, the Wisconsin governor has built relationships with nearly every major conservative donor in the country. His known big-money supporters range from financial industry billionaires to private business owners to tea party activists, albeit with an emphasis on those involved in the political empire of Charles and David Koch.Speaking recently in New Hampshire, Walker indicated how he leans, however -- and it's not toward the establishment side.âWhat weâre hoping going forward are not donors of obligation but donors of passion, people who are passionate about the reforms we bring to the table,â Walker said.Donors to Freedom Partners Action Fund, the main super PAC of the Kochs, are already some of the biggest backers of Walkerâs pre-presidential campaign. Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks, who wrote a $1 million check to the Koch group in 2014, is in Walkerâs corner. So is Minnesota-based cable television broadcaster Stanley Hubbard, who gave $450,000 to Freedom Partners and is actively recruiting donors to give to Walkerâs campaign.Hendricks, the owner of the largest roofing supply company in the country, told Bloomberg that she was being courted by nearly every Republican presidential aspirant but, âIf [Walker] goes out here and he keeps doing what heâs doing, heâs going to be the person that I will support.âWalker is currently raising money for a political nonprofit called Our American Revival, which can receive unlimited campaign contributions. It has attracted contributions from Hubbard and many others.Among those is Chicago-based hedge fund executive Ken Griffin. While he's said he has not decided which 2016 candidate to ultimately back, he has written a $100,000 check to Walkerâs group. Griffin, who once publicly mused that billionaires like himself have âinsufficient influenceâ in politics, is a more mainstream Republican donor, having given millions to American Crossroads, Restore Our Future and Ending Spending Action Fund, the super PAC founded by TD Ameritrade billionaire Joe Ricketts. At the same time, Griffin is a more recent entrant to political giving with less direct connection to the old fundraising networks.On the tea party side, Walker supporter Andy Miller, a Tennessee health care venture capitalist, previously gave more than $100,000 to a super PAC supporting Joe Carr, last year's tea party challenger to incumbent Sen. Alexander. Miller, chairman and executive director of the Tennessee Freedom Coalition, has also donated to Tea Party Patriots and USA PAC, a super PAC that attempted to oust Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) in the 2012 primary election.Many big fish are still on the loose -- casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and vulture capitalist Paul Singer, among them -- and other expected GOP candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) look to hook at least one donor willing to write large super PAC checks. They will have to move fast as the wealthy are already sorting out their loyalties."

In an effort to raise money and bring some attention to the largely rural county in northwest New Hampshire, the Grafton County Republican Committeeâs tie auction featured neckwear donated by potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates. Real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump was among the 18 possible Republican White House hopefuls who contributed a tie to the auction.

To conduct their experiment researchers at University College London split 122 students into groups of four people. The groups were then shown separate 10-minute mood-induction videos: One meant to prompt a kind of laugh-out-loud laughter (a stand-up performance by comedian Michael McIntyre), one meant to stimulate pleasant feelings (an excerpt from ""Planet Earth,"" that depicted relaxing landscapes and animals) and one meant to induce neutral feelings (an instructional golf video -- snooze). Though subjects did not interact with other until after viewing the clips, they watched the scenes in groups of four, based on the premise that laughter is contagious. Research shows that people are 30 times more likely to audibly chuckle when in a social setting. Researchers discovered that the groups of students who had watched the stand-up routine were most likely to disclose intimate details about their own lives. Sentences like, âHalf of my favorite films are (embarrassingly) Disney films,â and  âIn January I broke my collarbone falling off a pole while pole dancing,â are examples of ""highly intimate disclosure statements."" Statements that were most limited in self-disclosure (and a bit mundane), like ""I am from Cheltenham,â and âI am at Worcester College in my first year,â were most prevalent among the groups who had been shown the clips meant to induce neutral or pleasant feelings. The study's authors hypothesize that laughter is a social coaxer, making people feel more relaxed about the details they communicate. ""Given the importance of disclosing behaviors in facilitating the development of intense social bonds, it is possible that the act of laughing may temporarily influence the laugherâs willingness to disclose personal information,"" the study reads. This could potentially explain why you may think your best friends are also your funniest friends; laughter makes people more comfortable letting their guards down, which makes them feel more connected (less small talk, more real talk). Laughter and general playfulness are linked to stress relief, healthy blood sugar and blood pressure levels as well as a stronger immune system.

After burning the likes of Charlie Sheen, James Franco and David Hasselhoff, roasting someone with as many pre-written punchlines as Bieber gave Ross the opportunity to step up his game. Plus, he even thinks Bieber will earn some good will out of it -- if we aren't all too traumatized by whatever Martha Stewart has to say about him.Ross spoke to The Huffington Post over the phone on Tuesday to highlight some of the best moments of the roast, which will air on Comedy Central on Monday, March 30. He also talks about using insult comedy to deflect a bully as a kid (P.S. did you know Ross has a black belt?!) and officially announces his next dream roast target: Kanye West.How soon do you start writing jokes for each roast? Well, the way my brain works, it starts immediately when I hear the name. I can't help it. I don't have a filter to keep me from thinking of how to take that person on. So, I start as soon as I hear the announcement or even when they're just thinking about that person, I start coming up with jokes in my head.Do you ever do any deep research to dig up dirt on your subjects? I did actually, I even talked to Selena Gomez. I ran into her and asked her for advice on roasting the Biebs, and she said, ""Tell the truth. That always worked for me.""Where does this roast stand as far as your favorites go? Wow, you know, I never look at them that way because I have so much fun on all of them, but until I see it on TV, I don't know. This one was more fun because making fun of Justin is almost like a national pastime. I mean, he's an easy target. The jokes come easy. It's like making fun of relationships or airline food.Which person on the dais shocked you the most with their jokes? Oh, Martha Stewart, for sure. That was insanity.Yeah, how exactly did she wind up there? Apparently Justin invited her to be a part of it. They had hit it off during some previous encounter -- I think he thinks she's cute. He invited her himself, as he did with most of the dais, I think.That's crazy. What do you think they have in common? Well, they've both been to jail, so they have that in common. [Laughs]You told me last week that Bieber had a really good rebuttal. Yeah, his rebuttal was really funny. He told one of my favorite jokes I've ever heard about me. He said I looked like ""the emoji for food poisoning."" And he wrote sort of an ending message, a mea culpa of sorts. It was a sincere apology in a way. He read it to me off his notebook the day before and you could tell he worked hard on it. I think people are going to like him more after this roast. I mean, I didn't know much about him and I really came to be fond of him because of this. He took it really well and he owned a lot of his past mistakes. You've gotta give him credit for that.That's a smart move for a rebuttal. You either have to endear yourself or try to one-up everyone. He kind of did both. It had different flavors to it. He had some killer roast jokes back at everyone and then he crushed everybody with his sincerity. I thought it was a winning effort for him. I think people are going to dig the way he handled it. I mean, what were you doing when you were 21? Figuring out how to atone for your sins? At the end of the day he's just a young man with a big heart and a lot of fans. I just kind of saw him as a normal guy.It sounds like being roasted might get people to lay off of him for a while, ironically. I hope that happens, because when someone puts themselves out there like he did for this roast, I'd like to see him get a little break and some good will from it. I don't know, he's obviously made some mistakes but he's also done a lot of good stuff for other people and charities, and he's talented. He's worth saving. I'm a believer in second chances and his fans really care about him and what he does and says, so if he sets a good example, that's really important. Otherwise we'll end up with a whole generation of assholes and it'll be his fault. One bittersweet part of seeing new roasts is remembering how great the late Greg Giraldo was on them. Well, when you have a big target like Bieber you can't help but miss Greg, because there would have been a real sense of honesty and truth to Greg's roast on Bieber. I can't help but miss him on a night like that. But you know, I could talk about Greg all day. He was not just a friend but a great comic. I thought Hannibal Buress channeled Greg Giraldo in a way, at the roast. When you see his set, you'll see a lot of honesty in there.How long have you been roasting people? Were you ever bullied as a kid, or did you roast others back then? Oh I used it as self-defense against the bullies. There was a bully who was picking on everybody in my class and physically hurting people, like jumping out in the hallways and punching people in the nuts. It was just terrible, and I was even taking karate lessons but he was much bigger than me. And I remember promising myself that the next time he hit me I was going to hit him back. Then he hit me and I went down and I couldn't even get up to hit him back, so I started making fun of him. Everybody laughed at him and he got really humiliated and never bothered me again. A young roast master was born.That's a pretty good origin story. Well, I took karate as a kid and was a black belt in taekwondo at 10-and-a-half, so I feel like that gave me a certain confidence to talk smack where I wouldn't have been able to do that.Wow, you were a black belt? I guess technically I still am. Even though it doesn't fit around my waist anymore.So, who would be the ultimate person to roast after this? It's funny you say that, because before Bieber, I would always just that I didn't really have an answer, but I remember a year ago someone asked me that same question and I said Justin Bieber would be hte ultimate roast, and then it happened. So, now I might as well put it out there: Kanye. Kanye! Kanye should be next. He's so made, the jokes would just bounce off him. And he loves a good party. He'd be surrounded by his friends and loved ones.And it would be all about him. Who doesn't love to be the center of attention, even when there's a target on their forehead?You have to make this happen. Anytime and anywhere, Kanye. Anytime and anywhere. [Laughs] I'm a big fan, so it would make a lot of sense. It would be a great roast. He even has a roast theme song! What's that one about the haters and the assholes?He does love talking about the haters. It would be perfect for him. He has the opening roast theme song already!Finally, did anything crazy happen at the roast after party? [Laughs] Well, I brought all my friends into Snoop's trailer for an after-party party, and everything after that is a cloud in my head. It's a blur. I do remember that Snoop was even funnier roasting the roast at the after party. Snoop is amazing because he easily could have been a comedian if he wasn't a rapper. He has the timing and wit of a great comic. He did a lot of improvising at the roast and you'll see some of that in the final show. "

(AP Photo/Cathleen Allison)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ef9f2000000f0201da7e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Nevada state Senate committee has introduced legislation that would eliminate early voting on Sundays and restrict counties' abilities to set their own voting hours, in the latest move to reshape how elections are held in the state. Senate Bill 433 was introduced on Monday by the Nevada Senate Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections. Under the terms of the bill, voting on Sundays during the early voting period ahead of next year's elections would no longer be allowed, and counties would no longer be able to keep their polls open beyond 7 p.m. Previously, polling sites in areas like Clark County, which contains Las Vegas, had kept polls open until 9 p.m.State Sen. Patricia Farley (R), who chairs the committee that introduced the early voting legislation, and state Sen. James Settelmeyer (R), the committee's vice chair, did not respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post about why they introduced the bill. If the law passes the Republican-controlled state legislature and is signed by Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), Nevada would remove itself from the group of nine states -- Alaska, Illinois, Ohio, Maryland, California, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Massachusetts -- that have Sunday voting or that leave it up to county clerks to choose whether facilities will be open on Sundays.Yvanna Cancela, the political director of the Culinary Union 226, which represents more than 55,000 employees on the Las Vegas strip and at the city's airport, called Senate Bill 433 an intentional effort to suppress the votes of the union's members. âThis is a deliberate attempt to make it harder for people to vote, and specifically in Nevada, in Las Vegas, where there is a 24-hour economy, it is not like in other cities where most people work 9-to-5 jobs,"" Cancela told HuffPost. ""If you look at our people, like the gaming industry workers, this would dramatically affect their ability to vote based on their work schedule.""State Senate Minority Leader Aaron Ford (D) told HuffPost that the bill to restrict early voting hours struck him as ""problematic"" and a ""direct attack"" on African-Americans who go to vote on Sundays with their church, a tradition known as ""Souls to the Polls.""""We've seen around the nation efforts to curtail the opportunity for disadvantaged individuals and minorities to vote, and Sunday is one of those examples,"" he said. Ford also said that restricting the operating hours of early voting locations would infringe upon the ""fundamental rights of lower-income individuals who work different types of hours"" in Nevada. ""If a county or a municipality wants to expand the hours to accommodate those individuals, they should be allowed to do so, and our state shouldn't be in the way of a free, fair and accessible election,"" Ford told HuffPost. ""This is a nationwide trend from Republicans to pick who their electors are."" The bill is a part of a wave of election-related legislation pushed by the Nevada GOP since November, when the party took control of both chambers of the legislature and the governorship for the first time since 1929. A different bill is advancing that would require a piece of government-issued photo identification to vote. Other bills aim to grant state officials the authority to terminate the registrations of voters who âmay not be citizens.""Republicans have said the legislation is meant to keep undocumented immigrants from voting and to maintain the integrity of the election process, while Democrats say such bills are intended to suppress the votes of minorities. The Nevada secretary of state's office has identified just five cases of voter fraud since 2008, according to the Las Vegas Sun.Since committee-introduced bills are rarely filed without approval from the chamber's leadership, there is a certain amount of 2016 U.S. Senate intrigue accompanying the election-related bills. State Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson (R) is considered a likely candidate for the seat held by retiring U.S. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D). In a speech to the Sun City Anthem Republican Club in Nevada on March 14, Roberson said there would be ""a lot of things weâre going to do with election law, aside from voter ID."" "

Obama spoke about the education budget. AFP PHOTO/BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ef9f260000300183c27c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"About one-third of borrowers with federal student loans owned by the U.S. Department of Education are late on their payments, according to new federal data.The figures, released by the Education Department on Thursday, are the first comprehensive look at the delinquency plaguing those who hold federal student loans. By the new metric, which the department has never used before, roughly 33 percent of borrowers were more than five days late on one of their federal student loans as of Dec. 31. (Since the department only released individual figures for its four largest contractors, rather than a total percentage, however, the actual figure may be a few percentage points higher or lower.) Previous measures had put the delinquency rate much lower, masking the true amount of distress among borrowers trying to make good on their taxpayer-backed debts.Some 41 million Americans collectively carry more than $1.1 trillion in education loans owned or guaranteed by the Education Department, a total that surpasses every form of consumer credit in the U.S. except home mortgages. Thursday's figure reflects more than two-thirds of the $1.1 trillion total. The remainder is owned by the private sector as part of a bank-based federal loan program that has since been discontinued.The new measure of borrower distress comes as the White House urges the Education Department to improve its management of the growing federal student loan program and to give borrowers more protections against unmanageable debt loads.In recent years, groups ranging from federal financial regulators and Federal Reserve policymakers to chief executives of banks and other industry groups have warned about the increasing risk that student debt poses to U.S. economic growth, noting that debt burdens are sapping households' purchasing power amid an era of stagnant inflation-adjusted wages.Borrower advocates and the White House want the Education Department's loan contractors to communicate more effectively with borrowers and to increase their efforts to enroll struggling borrowers in repayment plans that cap payments relative to earnings. Improved loan counseling and caps on payments are both generally believed to lead to lower delinquency rates.While the Education Department ultimately guarantees the debts that are owned by banks and investors, it doesn't publicly release details about their performance. The department has been criticized for its relative opacity when it comes to publicly reporting details on its loan portfolio. It has also been slammed for not knowing enough about its loan program.For loans that it owns, the Education Department has previously publicized delinquency totals measured by number of loans and by dollar volume, but not by borrower. Past delinquency totals also only included loans that were 31 days late or more.Previous figures based on both the number of loans and the dollar amounts of those loans from the departmentâs main student loan program had suggested delinquency rates of around 20 percent.Measured by loan dollars that are at least a month late, the Education Department's main program had a 17 percent delinquency rate as of Dec. 31. By contrast, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently estimated that just 6 percent of all outstanding consumer debt was at least 30 days late as of the same date. ""We know that the rising cost of higher education and growing levels of student debt hit home for millions of Americans,"" said Denise Horn, an Education Department spokeswoman. She added that the department enables borrowers to keep current on their loans by making payments based on their earnings, and said it is also trying to keep costs low for future borrowers by rating schools and helping students evaluate college costs before they enroll.But the data released Thursday suggest that those efforts aren't having much effect on former students struggling to manage their federal debt burdens.""Anyone looking at these numbers would have to say that the needs of borrowers aren't being met,"" said Chris Hicks, who leads the Debt-Free Future campaign at the advocacy group Jobs With Justice.That's the kind of conclusion President Barack Obama has sought to forestall. Last June, before signing a memorandum instructing Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Education Secretary Arne Duncan to improve the way their departments work with vulnerable borrowers, Obama announced that the Education Department would renegotiate its contracts with loan companies it pays to collect borrowers' monthly payments.""Weâre going to make it clear that these companies are in the business of helping students, not just collecting payments, and they owe young people the customer service, and support, and financial flexibility that they deserve,"" Obama said on June 9.The new contracts, officially signed in August, created new metrics by which the Education Department would grade its loan servicers' performance. The main contractors that service the department's loans are Navient Corp., the student loan giant formerly known as Sallie Mae; Nelnet Inc.; Great Lakes Higher Education Corp. & Affiliates; and Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, which is more commonly known as FedLoan Servicing.One of those new metrics was the percentage of borrowers in repayment who were more than five days late on their monthly payments. Those were the figures that the department publicly released for the first time on Thursday. However, while the White House has succeeded in getting the department to produce more precise data, the dismal figures indicate that the underlying problem does not appear to have improved.Of the Education Department's four main loan contractors, Nelnet was the worst performer. As of Dec. 31, more than 38 percent of its borrowers were late on their payments. More than 17 percent of its borrowers were between three months and 12 months overdue.""I think most of us would agree that's a failing grade,"" Hicks said of Nelnet.""While we are not pleased with the overall results and the repayment metrics, we are adapting our approach and working hard to increase our ranking under the new metrics,"" said Nelnet spokesman Ben Kiser. ""Offering our customers the best student loan experience possible has been a priority and we continue to make changes to enhance their experience.""Great Lakes had the best delinquency figure with a rate of just under 26 percent. ""None of these servicers are meeting standards that the Education Department should be holding them to,"" Hicks said. ""If they're failing borrowers who are trying to repay their debts, we shouldn't be giving them taxpayer dollars.""Representatives for Great Lakes, FedLoan and Navient did not respond to requests for comment.The Department of Education offers contractors a bonus of up to $200,000 if the proportion of their borrowers who are 30 days late or more is below 23 percent. While the data released Thursday doesn't indicate whether any of the four major contractors have achieved that milestone, the department declined to say when asked on Thursday whether any bonuses were given. Hicks pointed to this as an example of the department's lack of transparency, which he said is leading to an overall decline in trust in its management of the federal student loan program.By contrast, the Education Department's smaller loan contractors -- a group of nonprofits that collectively service less than 10 percent of the department's loan portfolio -- had much lower delinquency rates. The smaller contractors recorded rates ranging between 10 and 19 percent. But the departments limits how many new loans it sends to these smaller companies, despite calls from some in Congress to increase their market share. "

""No one should ever be made to feel threatened or intimidated because of what they look like or who they are. By taking appropriate action to hold wrongdoers accountable, the Department of Justice is sending a clear message that flagrant infringements of our historic civil rights will not go unnoticed or unpunished.""Prosecutors said Harris conspired with other students and draped the racially offensive items around the statue on the morning of Feb. 16, 2014. The Mississippi NAACP described the act as a ""racial hate crime."" The FBI and the University of Mississippi Police Department are currently investigating the case, which is being prosecuted by the DOJâs civil rights division and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Mississippi.Meredith enrolled in the university in 1962, but not without battling heavy opposition from students, faculty and the Mississippi governor. Protests ensued, prompting federal authorities to send more than 3,000 soldiers and 500 U.S. marshals to quell the riots. More than 200 people were left injured. ""I chose as my target the University of Mississippi, which in 1960 was the holiest temple of white supremacy in America, next to the U.S. Capitol and the White House, both of which were under the control of segregationists and their collaborators,"" Meredith wrote in his 2012 book, A Mission from God: A Memoir and Challenge for America.""I reasoned that if I could enter the University of Mississippi as its first known black student, I would fracture the system of state-enforced white supremacy in Mississippi. It would drive a stake into the heart of the beast.â"

In his 'Report prior to discussion' presented Tuesday morning to Synod Fathers and Fraternal delegates, the relator general Cardinal Peter Erdo, pointed to the 'privatization of love' as the greatest challenge to the family. (Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fdf83c000032000db3a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) When Pope Francis last year effectively demoted U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke by moving him out of a senior post in the Vatican to a largely ceremonial role as head of a Rome-based Catholic charity, it was viewed as a way to sideline one of the pontiffâs most outspoken critics on the right.But the move seems to have left Burke free to air his conservative â and pointed â views on efforts to change church practices, not that he was ever terribly hesitant about speaking his mind.Now the American churchman has spoken out again, telling an interviewer that gay couples and divorced and remarried Catholics who are trying to live good and faithful lives are still like âthe person who murders someone and yet is kind to other people.ââIf you are living publicly in a state of mortal sin there isnât any good act that you can perform that justifies that situation: the person remains in grave sin,â Burke said in an interview with LifeSiteNews, a U.S.-based web service focused on battling abortion and promoting other conservative causes.âAnd to give the impression that somehow thereâs something good about living in a state of grave sin is simply contrary to what the (Catholic) Church has always and everywhere taught,â said Burke, who spoke to LifeSiteNews in Rome.Asked if being âkindâ and âgenerousâ and âdedicatedâ is enough, Burke replied: âOf course itâs not. Itâs like the person who murders someone and yet is kind to other people.âThe lengthy interview was published on Tuesday (March 24).On the surface, Burkeâs comments break little theological ground; the church has always taught that sin is sin, and some sins are especially serious. For example, cohabitation, homosexual relations and adultery (which is how the Catholic Church views the relations of a couple who are divorced and remarried without annulling the first marriage) are viewed as mortal sins, as is murder.But comparing those situations in any context is unusual, and certainly out of step with the pastoral tone that Francis has set in his papacy. Moreover, reformers argue that a murderer â or almost any other sinner â can go to confession, receive absolution, and take Communion in a state of grace. But there is no such option for a gay person or those who are divorced and remarried, except permanent celibacy.The cardinalâs comments take on added weight in the context of the increasingly heated debate that Francis opened over how the church should respond to rapid changes in family life in the modern world.The issues were heatedly debated at a global summit of bishops and cardinals at the Vatican last October, and the debates have continued as both sides jockey for position ahead of a follow-up synod this October. Those who back reforms in church practices and attitudes â especially toward gay couples and those who are divorced or cohabiting â are opposed by those who see any changes as tantamount to undermining doctrine.During last fallâs synod, several high-ranking churchmen spoke about the lives of unmarried or remarried couples as having value that the church should recognize.Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, for example, repeatedly stressed that the church should âlook at the person and not the sexual orientation.â He cited the case of a gay couple he knew in which one partner cared for the other through a long-term illness in a way that was âexemplary. Full stop.âSimilarly, Cardinal Reinhard Marx of Munich, a senior adviser to Francis, said that âone simply cannot say that a faithful homosexual relationship that has held for decades is nothing.ââWe just mustnât lump things together and measure everything with the same yardstick, but must differentiate and take a closer look, which doesnât mean that I endorse homosexuality as a whole,â he said.But such language sounded alarm bells for traditionalists like Burke, who after the synod was named to the largely ceremonial post of patron of the Order of the Knights of Malta. In his earlier post in the Roman Curia, Burke was automatically included in the synod discussions; he will probably not take part in this fallâs meeting.In this latest interview, he repeated his earlier claims that reformers were manipulating the synod discussions and waging a media campaign âto justify extra-marital sexual relations and sexual acts between persons of the same sexâ that would undermine church teaching.Burke, 66, has raised eyebrows, and made headlines, with previous comments. Earlier this year, he argued that the church has become too âfeminizedâ and he blamed the introduction of altar girls more than 20 years ago for the decline in vocations to the churchâs all-male priesthood.The cardinal also blamed gay clergy for the churchâs sexual abuse crisis, saying priests âwho were feminized and confused about their own sexual identityâ were the ones who molested children.ALSO ON THE HUFFINGTON POST:  Sister Joan Chittister on the Paradox of Faith"
