When one rural village re-erected a cross in the summer, authorities put it under a 24-hour watch, which has now gone on for nearly five months. ""This year's Christmas has been exceptional, as a group of uniformed men have been helping us move tables, direct traffic, and guard holiday decorations as well as the front door, the back door, the warehouse and the sanctuary,"" Tao wrote on a social media site. (AP Photo/Didi Tang)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fdf82100000001c91ebc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIJING (AP) — A Christian pastor who questioned authorities in eastern China about the forced removal of crosses from the roofs of churches was sentenced Tuesday to one year in prison, his lawyer said.Huang Yizi is the first person to be jailed for opposing Zhejiang province's intense campaign to remove crosses from churches.Authorities in the province tore down about 400 rooftop crosses last year, saying they violated the building code. Churchgoers and religious rights advocates say the Christian faith is being targeted because its rapid growth unnerves the ruling Communist Party.After a six-hour trial, a court in the city of Pingyang found Huang guilty of gathering crowds to disrupt social order, lawyer Zhang Kai said by telephone.A woman who answered the court's phone and gave only her family name, Li, confirmed that Huang's trial took place Tuesday afternoon. The phone rang unanswered in the evening, when the trial ended.Huang, an outspoken pastor, was taken away by police last summer after he brought some parishioners to a local government building to demand answers about a July clash in which security personnel armed with sticks attacked congregation members who had been keeping a night vigil over the cross atop their sanctuary.Huang also urged local church leaders to put back the toppled crosses.Zhang said the charge stemmed largely from the gathering in front of the government building, but said Huang did not disrupt social order and instead played a mediating role.Zhang said the defense argued that Huang's activism was justified because authorities violated the law by trying to remove the cross by force and without legal ground. The court rejected that defense, Zhang said."

It's something I never wanted to be made public. But I've recently been thinking about my journey and decided it's time to confess to something I no longer do.I am a former cutter. I used to self-mutilate. (As I type this, my chest tightens with tension and anxiety.)The key word here is not ""cutter"" but ""former."" I didn't realize until just this moment that it is completely in my past.When I was 15, I started showing signs of depression. I felt it in everything I did. I was aching with pain from the inside out but had no coping skills to help me handle all the awful emotions I was feeling. I thought I was fat, ugly, a failure, you name it. I was emotionally abusive to myself and didn't know how to stop.Then, after a particularly harrowing day of fighting off my personal demons, I had a stray thought pop into my head, one I had never had before nor heard anyone ever even talk about. ""What if I grabbed those scissors and swiped the sharp edge against my arm? I deserve it. I'm an idiot. I wonder what it would feel like."" I went for it.As a teenager in the grips of a deep depression, it was like nothing I'd ever felt before. All the pain and angst that had been building inside me finally seemed to have a place to go. The aggressive stinging that came from my angry swipe was oddly comforting. But now I had a problem.""What am I doing?! Am I crazy?!"" I was absolutely sure I was crazy. All of a sudden, the burden of pain had been lifted, only to be immediately followed by a more pressing problem. I never felt more alone or afraid in my life.Now, this was the year 2000. Mental health stigmas were in full force back then, so nothing was talked about. Living in a town of only 500 residents, I'd never even heard the words ""self-mutilation."" I did not know (nor would I have even guessed) that other people actually cut themselves on purpose as a coping mechanism. Or that through talking with a physician about medication and regular therapy, people were able to overcome it.I just didn't know. The only thing I knew was that I had to be crazy, because no logical person would want to do that to themselves. From then on out, I had a go-to when things got tough. I got good at hiding it, keeping it in unnoticeable places, but I knew I couldn't keep up the ""My Friend's Cat Scratched Me"" facade for long.Luckily, I have amazing parents who wouldn't give up on me, whether I liked it or not. They eventually convinced me to take Prozac about a year after my first ""incident."" When I finally started to feel ""normal"" again, I could hardly believe the change in my emotions. I wasn't crying as much, I could think more clearly, and I had a generally happy outlook on life. I'd wonder to myself, ""How did I ever do that to my body?"" It was an amazing feeling.I haven't looked back since. I've had some bad days over the years, but as long as I stay on my anti-depressant, I don't feel the urge to cut. I'm now taking one specifically for major depressive disorder (which I was diagnosed with about a year and a half ago) and my life has never been better.It's been more years than I can even remember since the last time I cut, and that is an amazing accomplishment for me. I struggled with using it as a coping mechanism for years but finally figured out the right balance of therapy and medication. And once I found out I was not the only person who felt the way I did, I was so relieved.Being able to talk about my issues and feeling like I had a support system were the keys to me getting completely mentally healthy again. I'm hope by telling my story I can reach someone who might feel like they're crazy, too, realize they're not and get the help they need.This post was first published on Defying Shadows.

A new war always seems to start before the last one ends. The U.S. is bombing targets in Syria and sending troops back into Iraq. Yet Washington's involvement in Afghanistan persists as the administration slows the withdrawal of American forces.Worse, pressure is building for the U.S. again to intervene in Libya. It took a decade before the sectarian flames fed by the invasion of Iraq lit the Islamic State. It took less than three years for the administration's intervention in Libya to blow up spectacularly. Observed Glenn Greenwald, ""Libya has rapidly unraveled in much the way Iraq did following that invasion: swamped by militia rule, factional warfare, economic devastation, and complete lawlessness."" The country of Libya has ceased to exist.This debacle offers a clear lesson for American policymakers. But denizens of Washington never learn from the past. Indeed, Samantha Power, one of the most consistent advocates of a militarized foreign policy, complained that ""one has to be careful about overdrawing lessons"" from failed interventions. In her view the fact that America's constant wars have resulted in constant failures -- and constant pressure to intervene again to confront the new problems created -- is no reason to be more careful in the future.Like many presidents in other conflicts, Barack Obama lied the American people into war. The administration presented the issue as one of humanitarian intervention, to save the people of Benghazi from slaughter. Moammar Khadafy, administration officials claimed, threatened murder and mayhem if he recaptured the city. Ironically, for decades the West did not take his rants seriously -- only when they thought it to their advantage did the U.S. and Europe react. Although he was a nasty character, he had slaughtered no one when his forces reclaimed other territory. In Benghazi, he only threatened those who had taken up arms against him. In fact, the allies never believed their rhetoric. They immediately shifted their objective from civilian protection to regime change, providing just enough military support to upend the balance of forces but not enough to quickly oust him. The world's greatest alliance allowed the low-tech civil war to burn for months, killing thousands. Some humanitarian operation.Still, the chief advocates of what has come to be called Hillary's war claimed success. Anne-Marie Slaughter, formerly with the Obama State Department, authored a celebratory Financial Times article entitled ""Why Libya skeptics were proved badly wrong."" Even before the fighting ended she was selling the conflict: ""it clearly can be in the U.S. and the West's strategic interest to help social revolutions fighting for the values we espouse and proclaim."" The New York Times ran a ""news analysis"" entitled: ""U.S. Tactics in Libya May Be a Model for Other Efforts."" Power then was silent about the danger of overdrawing lessons from the Libyan war.The War Lobby imagined a beautiful democratic future. Slaughter cited the fact that ""The National Transitional Council has a draft constitutional charter that is impressive in scope, aspirations and detail -- including 37 articles on rights, freedoms and governance arrangements."" What more could be necessary?Alas, Libya was an artificial nation. Khadafy held it together through personal rule, not a strong state. When he died political structure vanished. Khadafy was brutally executed; revenge killings and torture were common; black African workers were blamed for the old regime and abused. Khadafy's arsenals were looted, with weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles, flowing outward. The country split apart geographically, ethnically, ideologically, and theologically.Libya quickly went from disappointment to mess to catastrophe. Wrote the Economist: Libya has two rival governments, two parliaments, two sets of competing claims to run the central bank and the national oil company, no functioning national police or army, and an array of militias that terrorize the country's six million citizens, plunder what remains of the country's wealth, ruin what little is left of its infrastructure, and torture and kill wherever they are in the ascendency.Today, these warring factions have divided the territory known as Libya into two broad coalitions.""Operation Dignity"" is a largely secular grouping including Gen. Khalifa Haftar's ""Libyan National Army"" and the internationally recognized government. The latter was pushed out of the capital of Tripoli last August and is headquartered in Tobruk and Bayda in the east. Haftar, a former Khadafy general, is a man of flexible loyalties who spent years in the U.S. and offered to run for president if ""desired"" by the people. Last May, he launched his campaign against the Islamist militias with covert support from Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.""Libya Dawn"" is a mix of Islamists, moderate to radical, and conservative merchants which now controls Tripoli. They are backed by Qatar, Sudan, and Turkey, and deny that the Islamic State poses much of a threat. Indeed, government spokesman Jamal Haji Zubia claimed that ""these terrorists"" merely pretended to be from ISIL, but instead were Khadafy supporters who ""put on the mantle of the Islamic State.""The civil war has been intensifying, with combatants utilizing heavy weapons and even air power. Last year fighting forced the closure of the U.S. embassy. Even before the rise of the Islamic State radical jihadists flourished; the city of Derna sent many young men to Iraq and Syria. Some of these groups were responsible for the attack on U.S. consular compound and murder of U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others in Benghazi more than two years ago.Now Libya has become an ISIL outpost. Aref Ali Nayed, representing the official Libyan government in the UAE, said ""Libya is becoming the gas station, ATM, and airport for ISIS."" Three jihadist groups have formally claimed allegiance to the Islamic State. Benghazi, the city which helped trigger Western intervention, is now mostly in radical hands. Self-proclaimed Islamic State forces have attacked oil installations, killed journalists, and bombed embassies and a luxury hotel frequented by Westerners. The conflict has seeped out of Libya. Warned the Economist:Arab tribes and other ethnic groups in the country's rugged south are running amok, smuggling arms, trafficking people and providing havens and succor to assorted ne'er-do-wells and jihadists pledging allegiance to al-Qaeda and even to the murderous Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.ISIL's murder of 21 kidnapped Egyptian Coptic workers triggered retaliatory airstrikes by Cairo, and then, in turn, Islamic State attacks on an airport and the Iranian ambassador's residence as well as several car bombings. Thomas Joscelyn of the Long War Journal noted that ISIL's power has been overrated. But the group is gaining influence as the national wreckage known as Libya is being pulled into the regional sectarian maelstrom. So much for Hillary Clinton's splendid little war.Obviously, Khadafy's continued rule would have been no picnic. Nevertheless, he offered an ugly stability which in retrospect looks better than chaos, civil war, and terrorism. And worse may come. UN envoy Bernardino Leon worried: ""Libya has the same features of potentially becoming as bad as what we're seeing in Iraq and Syria. The difference is that Libya is just a few miles away from Europe."" British envoy Jonathan Powell warned of the emergence of ""Somalia by the Med.""Although Islamic State bluster about ""conquering"" Rome obviously is just that, Libyans have been fleeing across the Mediterranean in search of safety and work. European officials now worry about larger refugee flows, drug and weapons smuggling, and new terrorist attacks. After more than a year of unsuccessful attempts at mediation between the warring factions, Powell warned: ""Libya is far too big to contain.""In Libya, as with most other failed interventions, war advocates say the problem was that America didn't stick around. They enthusiastically, even gaily, blew up another country, only to blame the rescue personnel for not showing up fast enough. The Washington Post, one of the war's cheerleaders, complained that NATO ""abandoned Libya."" But exactly what could the alliance have done? The allies only played a supporting role; the Libyans liberated themselves through their own boots on the ground. The militias fighting now would have resisted any foreign occupation, even if organized by the Pentagon rather than the Post.Alas, this disastrous history hasn't precluded new proposals for Western involvement. Abdullah al-Thinni, Libya's official prime minister, wants the West to come back. He asked that the ""world powers stand by Libya and launch military strikes against"" the Islamic State and al-Qaeda affiliates. Egypt and France urged the UN Security Council to meet on the issue. ""What is happening in Libya is a threat to international peace and security,"" explained Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Italy also is demanding unspecified action. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi advocated that the UN run a ""stronger mission."" Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti said, ""We have been discussing this for months but now it has become urgent. The risk is imminent, we cannot wait any longer. Italy has national defense needs and cannot have a caliphate ruling across the shores from us."" Interior Minister Angelino Alfano warned of the potential for an attack on the Vatican.Unfortunately, there's no reason to believe that the second (or third) time would be the charm. The Atlantic Council's Karim Mezran observed: ""There are no good guys or bad guys there -- both sides have been acting in bad faith."" The West naturally favors the internationally recognized government. But these forces are divided and Haftar, the dominant figure, is a dubious ally. Although better armed than the Islamist forces, he probably has fewer fighters and less popular support. Worse, an unnamed administration staffer told New Yorker's Jon Lee Anderson: The U.S. government has nothing to do with General Khalifa Haftar. Haftar is killing people, and he says he is targeting terrorists, but his definition is way too broad. Haftar is a vigilante. And the predictable result of his vigilantism is to unite the others.Intervening against the Islamist-oriented government would make enemies of many people not linked to the Islamic State. The former denounced the Egyptian airstrikes as a ""treacherous aggression"" and ""terrorism."" Egypt's retaliatory attacks were directed at militants in camps different from those who murdered the Copts. Warned the Post: Just as [Egypt's al-Sisi] makes no distinction between terrorists operating in the Sinai Peninsula and the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood politicians he deposed in a 2013 military coup, Mr. Sisi does not acknowledge a difference between the Islamic State militants and the Libya Dawn faction in Tripoli.The best outcome would be a national unity government as backed by the U.S. and five European governments. They said in a recent statement that those opposing a democratic transition ""will not be allowed to condemn Libya to chaos and extremism."" Alas, Libya already is there. The Post urged ""concerted pressure"" on Libya's two major factions to create an effective government. However, it's not clear what more the Western powers can do. Anonymous UN officials told Fox News that NATO was ready ""to support Libya with advice on defense and security institution-building."" But lack of knowledge is not the problem. Who is able to act on such knowledge? Libyan blogger Mohamed Eljarh urged international support for ""Libyan partners ... who stand for inclusion, democracy, and the rule of law. Such Libyan voices are indispensable to any international or regional solution."" But where are they and, more important, what can they do? The Economist called for diplomacy to produce a national unity government and federal system with substantial autonomy for cities and regions. Yet in the next breath the magazine acknowledged: ""it has to be admitted that such schemes have rarely worked in the winter-takes-all Arab world.""More practical would be to acquiesce in the partition of what never was an organic nation. In the meantime, the West should consider selectively lifting the arms embargo to aid groups likely to combat jihadist forces. Official Libya's UN ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi indicated interest in international aid, but explained: ""We must have the arms to not only be able to fight the terrorists, but need to be able to destroy them if they try to re-establish in our country."" Doing so might fuel the ongoing civil war, but with no settlement in sight Washington's highest priority should be enabling local parties to defeat groups of greatest concern to America.Moreover, Libya's neighbors should act rather than wait helplessly for Washington to do something. America's security dependents might be no more effective than the U.S. -- indeed, retired Egyptian military officers warn against their nation being drawn into combating an insurgency -- but the region's stability is these nations' business. They should put their arsenals filled with expensive American-made weapons to practical use.Libya's collapse has been almost total. Alas, the consequences will linger for years if not decades. The Obama administration's greatest foreign policy mistake can't be undone.Yet, complained Daniel Larison of the American Conservative, so far ""the supporters of this disgraceful and unnecessary war have faced no backlash or even much serious criticism."" As the problems metastasize with the rise of ISIL in Libya, however, the American people may be more inclined, contra Samantha Power, to critically assess the judgment and competence of Washington policymakers. When war-happy politicians, including Hillary Clinton and her gaggle of Republican rivals, next stand before America, voters should hold these pitiful policymakers accountable for the disaster they created in Libya.This post first appeared at Forbes online."

How does it make you feel?I'm scared to death. My heart is pounding even as I write these words. I can almost feel an icy wind whipping across my face and my kids at the bottom of the run, chanting, ""C'mon, Mom! Move it!""I know how to ski. I'm a good skier. But after a year away from the slopes, it takes me a while to get my ski legs.So this year, I decided to eliminate the fear. The solution? Weekly Yoga, meditation and a plan to make this the best ski break ever, regardless of the snow quality.It's foolproof, right?We started this adventure last summer, when we took up Yoga with the kids. Our instructor, Monica, patiently showed the entire family -- yes, even the two youngest ones, ages 7 and 9, the basics of Yoga. We learned how to breathe, how to hold a pose, how to rest. These proved to be important skills on the slope.Visualization also helped. In the weeks leading up to the trip, it took only a few minutes each day to find a quiet place and imagine myself skiing from the top of a mountain to the base. The idea was to be prepared for the new terrain (after all there aren't many mountains in Florida, where we live). My favorite meditations ended at a coffee shop. That's right.So when the time came to head out to Colorado's Summit County for early spring skiing, we were ready. Keystone Mountain Resort, our first stop, is at an ear-popping elevation of 9,280 feet. But we were relaxed about the thin atmosphere. We took deep breaths. No stress, Mom.The secret to getting your ski legs is pace. Don't be the first one on the mountain; don't be the last one off the mountain. We were suited up and ready to ski at around 10 a.m. And we didn't do it alone. We were joined by an instructor, who helped assess our ski ability and suggested ways we could improve our technique. We took a long lunch. No pressure.Taking your time is important, and not just for your mental health. There's so much scenery to enjoy up here, you can almost forget you're strapped to two plastic boards with sharp edges and all waxed up so they go real fast. Oh, wait. I just felt my heart skip a beat as I wrote that sentence. Deep breaths, Kari.Once you have your ski legs -- and you eventually will -- you can really experience the Colorado Rockies. On our second night here it snowed, leaving a generous dusting of early spring powder. It was incredibly skiable. And with all of our anxieties blown away like bad toxins, it was all downhill from there."

Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed a bill Thursday prohibiting state laws that ""substantially burden"" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. (AP Photo/Doug McSchooler)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8efbd2000000f0201da88.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The easy part is over. Americans now understand what the Indiana ""Religious Freedom"" law was intended to do: legalize discrimination by private businesses against homosexuals. It's not a secret, as Eric Miller of Advance America said. Indiana acted ""to help protect churches, Christian businesses and individuals from those who want to punish them because of their Biblical beliefs! Christian businesses and individuals deserve protection from those who support homosexual marriages. A Christian business should not be punished for refusing to allow a man to use the women's restroom!""Anti-gay bias and intent to discriminate are itself reasons to oppose the new law. But there's much more at stake. The organized Right is re-writing the Constitution and the impact will not be limited to gay Americans.The supporters of the Indiana law are more diverse, intellectually capable, and more widely found across America than we think. Nineteen states have such laws, and not just the Old Confederacy. Liberal Rhode Island has one. The Indiana Catholic Conference supported the law (It ""is very important to secure its passage""). The Indiana legislature considered it carefully, had hearings and received pages of testimony from distinguished legal scholars. (The Bill and the Testimony can be found at: The Bill; The Testimony)There are elements of their argument that most Americans would support. We widely accept that religious organizations and places of worship should be free to practice what they believe. Should a church have to marry people outside its faith and beliefs? Should a Catholic church be legally required to perform a same-sex marriage? Should an Orthodox shul or a mosque be legally required to hire female rabbis and imams? Probably not.It makes you think. Most Americans would say that some laws, even good ones, don't apply inside a place of worship. If that is all the Indiana law did, it would not have stirred up the current commotion.But Indiana went well beyond that. The law extends the inside-the-church exemption to commercial enterprises. Business corporations get the same protection that a church gets.If you think you've heard this before, you're right. It's the same argument used to attack Obamacare in the ""Hobby Lobby"" lawsuit. That time is was about insurance coverage for contraception, but the argument was the same.And you also heard a variant in Citizens United, where the Supreme Court conservative majority said corporations have the same constitutional free speech rights as do living, breathing people.The traditional view was that by engaging in business, you agreed to live by the laws of commerce. If not, then religious belief could justify segregation, or refusal to hire or serve women, or Muslims, or Catholics, or Jews. Or gays. There were, and are, a lot of sincerely religious people who would jump at that opportunity. The Indiana law re-establishes the right to commercially discriminate, especially against gays, if that's your religious teaching.The Indiana brouhaha illuminates the broader, and more dangerous legal strategy at the heart of Tea Party, right-wing ideology, the personification of corporations. By enlarging the constitutional rights of powerful, wealthy and largely conservative corporations, the Right is diminishing the constitutional rights of most Americans.It isn't the least bit ""conservative"". It is a radical, un-American, reactionary re-writing of our basic freedoms. We had struck a constitutional balance between private religious observance and public commercial activity. Real conservatives would be looking for a way to reasonably accommodate both interests.With any luck, what's going on in Indiana will provoke a better understanding of what the Right is attempting. In the end, Tea Party skepticism of government intrusion on personal liberty is perfectly reasonable. But in this century, our liberties can be equally threatened by rewriting the Constitution to empower corporations that impinge on our liberty with equal effect.Practice your religion in peace and dignity. Do business without discrimination and bigotry. Sounds easy."

Martin O'Malley (D) prefers to begin his days with his mind about as far away as possible from the campaign trail.""In the morning, I generally take time to pray and sometimes that's at Mass; other times it's just at home,"" O'Malley, who is Catholic, told The Huffington Post on Thursday. ""At home, I try to take 20 minutes -- half hour, if I can -- to read what I call 'good stuff.'""Potential candidates are prone to tick off a list of politically safe books they've been consuming -- usually vociferously -- as a means of emphasizing just how serious and intellectually ambitious they are. But O'Malley's interests seem almost too eclectic to be considered electorally calculated. Among the Christian poets, theologians and authors whom O'Malley said he favors in his morning reading ritual are John O'Donohue, Ignatius of Loyola, Richard Rohr, Thomas Merton, Karl Rahner and C.S. Lewis. O'Malley also said he went on ""a big kick"" in which he was reading everything he could find by Jewish theologian and philosopher Abraham Heschel. Over the last year, O'Malley has been positioning himself for a likely 2016 Democratic presidential bid and has been carrying on a hectic travel schedule around the country that will only become more rigorous if he jumps into the race officially this spring. But the man who served two terms as governor and previously was mayor of Baltimore said that his jam-packed days always turn out better when he takes time for himself in the mornings. ""I learned really just in the last several years how very, very important that is,"" O'Malley said. ""When you're mayor, there are very few problems that can't be helped by working harder to tackle them. In the governor's office, I learned that you have to take time for that reflection and that solitude, out of which creativity is born. And so I developed a practice in the morning of becoming quiet and very centered at the beginning of the morning.""Others in politics have begun making similar commitments to greater work-life balance. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) is a big believer in meditation and has started a Quiet Time Caucus on the Hill. O'Malley, likewise, seems to see some policy implications for these types of matters. He said that his 24-year-old daughter -- a Teach For America teacher in Baltimore--has been including yoga as part of her instruction to first-graders. ""I don't think there's any curriculum for that city-wide,"" he said. ""But it has helped her kids learn, and it makes them feel better, and allows them to focus on what they need to focus on with the mindfulness of their own selves and the alignment that's required.""O'Malley singled out an address he had heard William Deresiewicz deliver to cadets at West Point, in which the author and essayist spoke about the importance of solitude in leadership. ""My sense is that we're on the verge of a new awareness of just how important the whole person is,"" O'Malley said. ""I don't know that it's necessarily religious in the institutional sense, but it certainly has a spiritual dimension, without which life loses meaning."" "

More than 10,300 people have succumbed to the disease across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the three countries hardest hit by the worst Ebola epidemic on record.Deputy Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah, who heads Liberia's Ebola response, said there was evidence to suggest the woman may have contracted the disease through sexual contact.Research has shown traces of Ebola in semen of some survivors for at least 82 days after the onset of symptoms, meaning they could carry the disease long after they have recovered.There is no conclusive scientific proof that these traces are infectious. But as a precaution, the World Health Organization (WHO) advises Ebola survivors to abstain from sex during a 90-day period following recovery or, failing that, to practice safe sex.Nyenswah said survivors should follow the WHO guidance for at least three months and suggested they even go a step further until the modes of transmission are better understood.""Ebola survivors should consider correct and consistent use of condoms for all sexual acts beyond three months until more information is available,"" he said.Liberian health officials were monitoring 211 individuals known to have come into contact with the deceased woman but Nyenswah said that none had so far presented symptoms of the disease.Liberia has largely succeeded in getting its Ebola outbreak under control and was on its way to completing the 42 days without a new case necessary to declaring the country free of the disease when it recorded the most recent infection.Its neighbors, however, have faced more difficulties in containing their own outbreaks.Sierra Leone, the worst affected of the three countries, wrapped up a three-day national lockdown aimed at accelerating the end of its Ebola epidemic on Sunday evening.""Thank God it's all over. It felt like prison. Let's see how it ends Ebola,"" Kadiatu Massaquoi, a resident of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, told Reuters. ""I am looking forward to normal life again.""Guinea's President Alpha Conde announced on Saturday new emergency measures enabling authorities to restrict movements in western Guinea, where Ebola transmission continues a year after the epidemic was declared.

At least Looking was provoking a much needed conversation. Perhaps the kind of bitching that surrounded the show comes from the fact that as a community, we're not ready to take ourselves seriously. We're not ready to confront the issue of racism in the gay community. We are afraid to confront the realities of crushed dreams and failed relationships. To consider the possibility of both true love and heartbreak. It's much easier to watch RuPaul because we don't need to invest in it. We don't have to confront ourselves -- instead, we wear masks. Beautiful, sequined, rainbow masks. Because for hundreds of years we've been told we're not good enough.

Some queer art is just plain bad and I think a lot of us are frustrated by that."" We need to hold ourselves to the highest standard.

On my newsfeed, in my office, on Twitter, the internet all over, seemed to both deride the show and relish in its demise. Indeed, the commentary felt like the acidic bite from that bitchy queen we all know. It was the feeling of walking into that party where you don't know anyone and you're the only one without a six pack. Worst of all, these kinds of comments all came from gay men.I liked the show because it finally presented a world I could relate to. It was refreshing to see a show that dealt with the issues that concern me and my community: being gay in America, dealing with questions of monogamy and infidelity, Grindr, Truvada, drugs, orgies, cruising. I personally have never seen any of these issues engaged with in any meaningful way in the mainstream media.Instead, I've only seen stereotypical and basic portrayals of gay men. I couldn't relate to either Jack's over-the-top camp or Will's apparent asexuality on Will & Grace. The gay couple on Modern Family just make me cringe. And the sex-fueled, party boys of Queer As Folk were most definitely stuck in the nineties.But with Looking, at last there was an attempt to create interesting, three dimensional characters, who had real desires, struggles and dreams. Here was a show that was beautifully shot, with an amazing soundtrack. With great performances from its cast. Here, I thought, finally is a show I can enjoy and relate to. I admit that part of the reason I relate to the show is because I am, indeed, a privileged white gay man. And the show was definitely lacking in diversity. But to be honest, so is the mainstream gay community. When I go to Fire Island in the summer, I feel like I'm the closest thing on the whole island to a person of color (I'm half Mexican). How many Grindr profiles come up with ""no black guys,"" or ""not into Asians""? The show was, in that sense, accurate, if deeply problematic. But at least it made us think about it. At least Looking was provoking a much needed conversation. Perhaps the kind of bitching that surrounded the show comes from the fact that as a community, we're not ready to take ourselves seriously. We're not ready to confront the issue of racism in the gay community. We are afraid to confront the realities of crushed dreams and failed relationships. To consider the possibility of both true love and heartbreak. It's much easier to watch RuPaul because we don't need to invest in it. We don't have to confront ourselves -- instead, we wear masks. Beautiful, sequined, rainbow masks. Because for hundreds of years we've been told we're not good enough. And now that there is a show that treats us like real people, we just can't handle it.Most of all, what the end of the show says to me is that America is not ready for a show with real gay characters. If the only people who were going to watch this show were a couple of gay guys, the show was always going to fail. And in an America where states are right now passing laws that make discrimination against LGBT folks legal, it makes sense that the audience for this show would be tiny. In an America where gay marriage has been the source of such debate and outrage, it makes sense. In an America where Ted Cruz could actually be elected president, it makes sense. Where trans women of color are murdered on a weekly basis, it makes sense. I don't believe that as a community we should become complacent and not critical of our representations in the media. As Ingrid Jungermann says, ""We should be harder on each other. Who better to be critical than someone who understands where you're coming from? Some queer art is just plain bad and I think a lot of us are frustrated by that."" We need to hold ourselves to the highest standard. We need to examine issues like racism and transphobia and critique art that fails to do so. But nor should we bitch about art that is at least trying to take us seriously. Or relish so gleefully in its demise. Otherwise, all we'll be left with is Cam and Mitch from Modern Family. I hope that the Andrew Haigh's of this world don't take the critiques to heart. That they continue to make interesting, moving and insightful portrayals of LGBT people. To push the envelope, provoke debate and make us think about who we are. That above all, show the world that lesbian, bi, gay and trans people are real, beautiful, different, wonderful people. God knows we need it."

Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes Thursday targeting military installations in Yemen held by Shiite rebels who were taking over a key port city in the country's south and had driven the embattled president to flee by sea, security officials said. (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8efb6220000bb01dd835d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The cities of Aden and Tikrit are roughly 1,500 miles apart as the crow flies. Between them the two cities frame the Arabian Peninsula. This week both cities were subject to an intense air campaign. The genesis of those two operations, and the consequences that they precipitated, speak volumes of the current realignment that is reshaping the political dynamic of the Middle East.The port city of Aden sits in the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula. It lies on the Indian Ocean, just kitty corner from the entrance to the Red Sea. It overlooks one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world; a route which is a key lifeline in the global petroleum trade. Historically, its geostrategic importance at the southern entrance to the Red Sea was second only to that of the Suez Canal. From the sixteenth century on, it was an important military outpost that controlled European access, via the Red Sea, to the Indian Ocean and the trade riches of Asia. On March 25, Houthi forces from the Ansar Allah militia (Supporters of God), a Shiite, Iranian backed, militant group attacked the al-Anad air base approximately 30 miles north of the seaport of Aden. The attack on the base was part of a larger operation designed to consolidate the Houthi positon in Yemen by seizing control of the country's second largest city and economic center. Earlier in the year, following the takeover of Saan'a by Ansar Allah militants on January 20, 2015, the Houthis had dissolved the Yemeni government.  Green Areas are Houthi Controlled, Grey Areas are AQIAP Controlled and Pink Areas are Controlled by the Yemeni Government Although these Areas are Largely DesertYemeni president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi had declared, on March 15, 2015, that Aden was the temporary capital of Yemen and urged government employees to relocate there. The city was the last stronghold of the Hadi government. Following the seizure of the al-Anar air base by the Houthis, Hadi fled the country and escaped to Saudi Arabia. Simultaneously, Hadi issued a request to the Arab league and to the U.N. Security Council to intervene in Yemen to restore his government. The next day, a Saudi led coalition began air attacks against Houthi targets in Yemen.According to Saudi sources the coalition consisted of more than 10 nations, including the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, with the exception of Oman, as well as Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, Egypt and Pakistan. Saudi Arabia confirmed that it had committed 100 Royal Saudi Air Force jets to the operation and that an additional 30 planes had been supplied by the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Bahrain and Kuwait and 10 from Qatar. Additional planes had been supplied by Jordan, Morocco and Sudan. Pakistan and Egypt had, according to Riyadh, supplied naval forces. As of March 27, however, Pakistani government officials claimed that the government in Karachi was still reviewing the extent of Pakistan's role in the operation. Significantly, Turkey quickly offered support for the Saudi led intervention and suggested that it might participate by offering logistical support. In addition, Saudi Arabia claimed it was prepared to commit up to 150,000 ground troops to the ""Decisive Storm"" operation.Officially, the intervention by Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners was to ""answer the call of President Hadi to protect Yemen and its people from the aggression of the Houthi militia."" Hadi flew to Sharm el-Sheikh on Friday to address the Arab league meeting being held there over the weekend. The Saudi led intervention was expected to receive official Arab league approval.It is hardly surprising that Riyadh would find the prospect of a Shiite militia led, Iranian backed, takeover of Yemen threatening. There are three particular elements of the Saudi intervention that are worth pointing out, however. First, although the intervention was ostensibly in response to Hadi's request for assistance to the Arab league, military operations began before the Arab League had officially taken the matter under consideration. Moreover, only 11 of the Arab League's 22 members opted to participate. Pakistan is not a member of the Arab League, neither is Turkey. Significantly, none of the Arab states with Shiite dominated governments, opted to become involved. Even more notable, the operation came together will little input or participation of the United States.   The fact is this was a Saudi organized, ""Sunni"" intervention against an Iranian backed, Shiite overthrow of a Sunni government. From that standpoint it represented a significant escalation to the previous Sunni-inspired interventions during the Shiite led demonstrations in Bahrain and the other Gulf states during the 2011 Arab Spring unrest. It was also a clear signal that Shiite unrest that threatened the stability of the Sunni governments of the Arabian Peninsula would also be met with an armed intervention.Secondly, noticeably quiet in the fight against the Houthi rebels was Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQIAP). In the last several years, AQIAP has emerged as al-Qaeda's most operationally sophisticated and largest ""franchise"" among its international affiliates. The Hadi government was cooperating with the United States in America's ongoing was against al-Qaeda. An American contingent at the al-Anad air base was responsible for coordinating drone strikes against AQIAP militants. In recent weeks, a Sunni militant group identifying itself as ""Sana'a Province"" and claiming to be an affiliate of Islamic State, took responsibility for four suicide bomb attacks against the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques. A fifth attack against a mosque in the northern city of Saada was foiled. AQIAP militants did capture the city of al-Houta, capital of Lahj province, about 20 miles to the east of Aden, on Friday March 27. They killed 20 soldiers before being driven out by Yemeni government forces loyal to President Hadi. Other than for this one incident, they have been relatively quiet.The third notable development was the involvement of Pakistani military forces. The Pakistani military has long standing ties to the Gulf States. Many military personnel from Saudi Arabia and the GCC have trained in Pakistani military facilities. Former Pakistani military officers are conspicuous as trainers and advisers in the armed forces of the Gulf States. There is also a significant Pakistani civilian population, estimated at approximately one million, employed in the Gulf. A formal military participation for Pakistani armed forces in the region would represent the first ""official"" role for Pakistan since its participation in the First Gulf War over 25 years ago. More importantly, there are deep and long-standing ties between the Saudi monarchy and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Moreover, Pakistani military forces have a long history of intervening in support of Saudi Arabia, dating back to at least 1969. During the 1970s and 1980s, approximately 15,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia. There have been persistent rumors, including a report by the BBC in 2013, although no hard evidence, that Riyadh helped finance the Pakistani nuclear development program. There have also been reports that the Saudis have obtained Pakistani designed ballistic missiles capable of carrying atomic warheads. The Saudi monarchy has publically stated that it considers Pakistan to be its closest non-Arab ally and its closest Muslim ally. With one of the largest armies in the world and the only Muslim nuclear power, Pakistan plays an important role in securing the kingdom's defensive needs. Pakistan's potential military role in the Gulf as a key element of a broad Sunni alliance is not without some risks. After Iran, Pakistan has the second largest community of Shia's, just slightly larger than Iraq's Shia population. There has been steadily mounting violence against Pakistan's Shias by a number of Sunni jihadist groups in Pakistan. To date, there has not been much evidence of Iranian involvement with Pakistan's Shia community. This could change very quickly however and Pakistan could easily find itself on the frontline of the broader Sunni-Shia rivalry. In the meantime, on the other side of the Arabian Peninsula, U.S. and Coalition air forces attacked Islamic State militants in the city of Tikrit. The air attacks came at the ""official request"" of the Iraqi government and were in response to the failure of a ground force, made up primarily of Iranian backed Shia militias and elements of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Quds Force, to seize Tikrit. The original operation had been launched without the ""official support"" of the United States. Sources at the White House and the Pentagon had both confirmed that they had not been made aware of the impending operation before it started and that the U.S. had not provided air support. Despite initial success against Islamic State militants in the area, the advance quickly bogged down, however. The Iraqi force was successful in surrounding Tikrit and cutting IS militants there from further reinforcements. As of March 28, approximately half of the city of Tikrit was in Iraqi hands and the balance was still controlled by Islamic State. Military Situation Tikrit Campaign, March 2015The United States insisted that the Shia militia groups pull back from the front lines around Tikrit as a precondition for coalition air strikes. The request was made in order to ensure that there would not be any need to coordinate the air attacks with forward units of the Shiite/Iranian force. In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. Central Command, stated that ""I will not, and I hope we never, coordinate or cooperate with Shia militias."" The pullback would also reduce the possibility of inadvertently striking any of the Shite militias in the areas during the air attacks.  In response to the launch of American air strikes, the Kataib Hizbollah (Hezbollah Battalions) and Asaib Ahl al-Haq (League of the Righteous) militias both suspended their further participation in the operation to take Tikrit in protest and withdrew their forces to a rear area. The two militia groups are comprised of Iraqi Shiites and claim to be loyal to Iranian Supreme leader Sayyid Ali Khamenei. They have received training, financing and arms from the Iranian Quds Force. Both organizations are listed as ""terrorist groups"" by the United States. They were implicated in thousands of attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq. The two groups comprised about 10,000 fighters, roughly one-third of the attacking force.  Asaib Ahl al-Haq (League of the Righteous) MilitiaThere is little doubt that the withdrawal of the two groups was on the instructions of Iran and that in doing so, Tehran was sending the Baghdad government a thinly veiled message that the Iraqi government would have to choose between relying on American air power or the ""boots on the ground"" that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard/Quds Force and their Shiite militia allies could supply. It's also been suggested that the ""controversy"" surrounding the U.S. air strikes in Tikrit reflect operational differences in strategy between the Iraqi government, who is anxious for a quick advance, and a slower, more deliberate Iranian approach of surrounding Tikrit and slowly starving out the IS militants there. The ""Iranian approach,"" it has been argued, would result in less damage to the city and fewer civilian casualties. This is not very plausible. The well documented record of atrocities and revenge killings by Shia militias against Islamic State militants and their suspected supporters makes it clear that, barring an escape, it will be a fight to the death for any remaining IS militants in Tikrit. Moreover, the city has been extensively booby-trapped. A Wall Street Journal report by Matt Bradley on March 19 claimed that the city center of Tikrit alone had been mined with more than 6,500 improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Moreover there have been reports that IS has built an extensive network of tunnels in Tikrit allowing it to move its troops out of sight of Iraqi forces as well as allowing it to strike in the rear of the Iraqi lines. The battle for Tikrit is a very good indication of the difficulty that Iraqi forces will encounter in trying to roll back the Islamic State. Iraqi forces can make quick progress in retaking outlying areas. These areas have relatively easy terrain, lack any kind of defense in depth and will prove particularly susceptible to air power. Moreover their overwhelming advantage in manpower, a key element of Iranian ""swarm tactics"", will allow them to surround their target and cut it off from further reinforcement since under the circumstances it's unlikely that Islamic State militants will favor a pitched battle against Iraqi forces. Once the outlying districts have been captured, however, and the target city surrounded, progress is likely to slow down considerably. Iraqi forces can expect to find Islamic State militants deeply entrenched in an urban nightmare of bobby traps and IEDs. Further advance will require a street by street, building by building, campaign of urban warfare against an opponent determined to fight to the death. Under these circumstances urban damage will be extensive and civilian casualties, assuming there are any civilians left, will be considerable. This was precisely the reason why the U.S, after its experience in the Battle of Fallujah, avoided urban battles with jihadist militants during the Iraqi Civil War. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)Moreover, the deep distrust with which the Shiite militias view American forces in Iraq and Tehran's desire to minimize and isolate American influence in Baghdad will further complicate the military campaign. Many of these militias fought against U.S. forces while they were stationed in Iraq. Moreover, Iraqi media frequently air reports that the United States is secretly arming and financing Islamic State militants while surreptitiously attacking pro-government fighters. What is particularly troubling is that such sentiments can be found at the highest levels of the Iraqi government and military. A Washington Post report by Loveday Morris on March 27 quoted Iraqi Brigadier General Abed al-Maliki's claim that ""everybody knows that the Americans are dropping supplies to Daesh."" The Baghdad government is finding itself in a positon where its most effective military force is controlled by Tehran, while at the same time the ""regular"" Iraqi military, after a disastrous showing against Islamic State, is being rebuilt under American supervision. Ultimately, it will have to find a way to either reconcile the two forces or dismantle the Iranian/Shiite militia proxy army. Neither task will be easy and neither task offers much hope for the future stability of the Iraqi government.Two cities, two air campaigns. In many ways completely different from each other, and yet both underscore the growing power and influence of Iran in the Middle East.

It was also a clear signal that Shiite unrest that threatened the stability of the Sunni governments of the Arabian Peninsula would also be met with an armed intervention.Secondly, noticeably quiet in the fight against the Houthi rebels was Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQIAP). In the last several years, AQIAP has emerged as al-Qaeda's most operationally sophisticated and largest ""franchise"" among its international affiliates.

With one of the largest armies in the world and the only Muslim nuclear power, Pakistan plays an important role in securing the kingdom's defensive needs. Pakistan's potential military role in the Gulf as a key element of a broad Sunni alliance is not without some risks. After Iran, Pakistan has the second largest community of Shia's, just slightly larger than Iraq's Shia population. There has been steadily mounting violence against Pakistan's Shias by a number of Sunni jihadist groups in Pakistan. To date, there has not been much evidence of Iranian involvement with Pakistan's Shia community. This could change very quickly however and Pakistan could easily find itself on the frontline of the broader Sunni-Shia rivalry.

Iraqi forces can make quick progress in retaking outlying areas. These areas have relatively easy terrain, lack any kind of defense in depth and will prove particularly susceptible to air power. Moreover their overwhelming advantage in manpower, a key element of Iranian ""swarm tactics"", will allow them to surround their target and cut it off from further reinforcement since under the circumstances it's unlikely that Islamic State militants will favor a pitched battle against Iraqi forces. Once the outlying districts have been captured, however, and the target city surrounded, progress is likely to slow down considerably. Iraqi forces can expect to find Islamic State militants deeply entrenched in an urban nightmare of bobby traps and IEDs. Further advance will require a street by street, building by building, campaign of urban warfare against an opponent determined to fight to the death. Under these circumstances urban damage will be extensive and civilian casualties, assuming there are any civilians left, will be considerable. This was precisely the reason why the U.S, after its experience in the Battle of Fallujah, avoided urban battles with jihadist militants during the Iraqi Civil War. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)Moreover, the deep distrust with which the Shiite militias view American forces in Iraq and Tehran's desire to minimize and isolate American influence in Baghdad will further complicate the military campaign. Many of these militias fought against U.S. forces while they were stationed in Iraq. Moreover, Iraqi media frequently air reports that the United States is secretly arming and financing Islamic State militants while surreptitiously attacking pro-government fighters. What is particularly troubling is that such sentiments can be found at the highest levels of the Iraqi government and military. A Washington Post report by Loveday Morris on March 27 quoted Iraqi Brigadier General Abed al-Maliki's claim that ""everybody knows that the Americans are dropping supplies to Daesh."" The Baghdad government is finding itself in a positon where its most effective military force is controlled by Tehran, while at the same time the ""regular"" Iraqi military, after a disastrous showing against Islamic State, is being rebuilt under American supervision. Ultimately, it will have to find a way to either reconcile the two forces or dismantle the Iranian/Shiite militia proxy army. Neither task will be easy and neither task offers much hope for the future stability of the Iraqi government.Two cities, two air campaigns. In many ways completely different from each other, and yet both underscore the growing power and influence of Iran in the Middle East. From Riyadh's perspective, these two conflicts at opposite ends of the Arabian Peninsula are just the opening round in the looming battle for Arabia."

We will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome at all NBA and WNBA events in Indiana and elsewhere,"" said a joint statement issued by the National Basketball Association, the Women's National Basketball Association, the Indiana Pacers and the Indiana Fever. Indiana Pacers and Fever owner Herb Simon added that all fans and players will continue to be welcome at his games.“The Indiana Pacers, Indiana Fever and Bankers Life Fieldhouse have the strongest possible commitment to inclusion and non-discrimination on any basis,"" he said. ""Everyone is always welcome at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. That has always been the policy from the very beginning of the Simon family’s involvement and it always will be.""Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act will allow any individual or corporation to cite its religious beliefs as a defense when sued by a private party. But what most troubles opponents of the legislation is that it could open the door to widespread discrimination. Business owners who don't want to serve same-sex couples, for example, may now have legal protections to discriminate.Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed the legislation Thursday despite opposition from business leaders, convention organizers and even the Republican mayor of the state's largest city.The NCAA, which is set to hold its men's Final Four game in Indianapolis next week, also condemned the new law Thursday. Reggie Miller, the former NBA star who played for the Pacers for 18 years, tweeted his disappointment Friday: Other businesses that have criticized Pence for signing the law include tech giant Salesforce -- whose CEO said the company will be canceling events in the state -- and Angie's List -- whose Republican CEO said he will not be moving forward with a $40 million expansion of the company's headquarters in Indianapolis.""Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none,"" Bill Oesterle said, ""and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents.""Under pressure, Pence told the Indianapolis Star on Saturday that he will back the introduction of a bill to ""clarify"" that the law does not promote discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. Such a measure could come next week.“I support religious liberty, and I support this law,” Pence said. “But we are in discussions with legislative leaders this weekend to see if there’s a way to clarify the intent of the law.”But gay rights advocates greeted Pence's announcement skeptically. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin tweeted that legislation would need to include explicit LGBT protections -- something that Pence has already said is not on his ""agenda."" ""You can't 'clarify' discrimination. Indiana now has billions of dollars and thousands of jobs on the line, all because the Governor wouldn't stop this dangerous bill,"" added Katie Blair, campaign manager of Freedom Indiana. ""He has a second chance to save our reputation for Hoosier hospitality, but he has to stand up and protect LGBT Hoosiers.""Want more updates from Amanda?

It can entertain, send a message, start a riot and transcend. It can be made selfishly and selflessly, for the ears of everyone or the ears of no one. It can put your mind at ease or fill it with fear. Some music tells a story not only with its lyrics, but with its sound. New artist [debut] is a Los Angeles-based group that is always evolving and never static. Creator Gareth Thomas describes the project as ""more than a band. It's a music and art collective with an ever-changing cast."" [debut] raised over $10,000 through a Kickstarter campaign to fund the production of their first full length album Postcards From Berlin.Beginning as a solo project with singer and producer Gareth Thomas, it has shape shifted into a rich and reflective ensemble project where the dynamic is always changing with its members. Thomas blended his love for analog synth and experimental music with the vibrational experience of electronic music to create a nebulous sound that encompasses you. The group's first single ""Starting to Love it"" was released in 2013 and featured Chris Eigner of Depeche Mode on drums. Siobhan Lynch of Recoil, Cyd Claire, Angela Bartys and Sammi Doll also shared their talents with [debut]'s art collective. They have also worked with prominent filmmakers Chris Corner (Sneaker Pimps, IAMX) as well as Danny Drysdale (The Killers, IAMX). Released on March 5th, Postcards From Berlin was produced by Thomas and engineered by Fabian G. Knof at Hansa Meistersaal (U2, David Bowie, Depeche Mode) in Berlin and mixed by Alvin Wee at Westside Pacific Studios in Los Angeles. Recording in two countries by multiple minds and styles gives the album a diverse sonic palette.On Postcards From Berlin, we follow [debut] as they discover their unique sound. Still a work in progress, [debut]'s music is highly cinematic and evocative, utilizing dark, electronically produced beats and synth paired with ethereal pianos, strings and female vocals. Even without lyrics, these tracks tell a story, leading the listener on a journey down a deep river of sound. The emotive lyrics are haunting and could easily find a home on an epic film soundtrack. Reminiscent of late 80s and 90s electronic alternative, their sound has been likened to Depeche Mode, IAMX, Massive Attack and Nine Inch Nails. Sweeping melodies and bridges make your body sway like a buoyant string of kelp. Each song is an honest and raw lament, evoking feelings of turmoil and obscure pasts. An example of how music can be therapeutic not just for its listener, but also for its creator.Postcards From Berlin is not for those seeking vacuous music with the sole purpose of entertainment. [debut] is for those who seek music that does not fear darkness but rather embraces it. Just like the duality of mankind, Postcards From Berlin is as wistful as it is angelic, as melancholy as it is sublime. The union of yin and yang translated into sound. For those who have no fear of plunging into dark sonic landscapes, [debut]'s Postcards From Berlin will intrepidly guide you there.Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/debutsounds Website: www.debutsounds.com Facebook: www.facebook.com/debutsounds YouTube: www.youtube.com/debutsounds Twitter: www.twitter.com/debutsounds Instagram: www.instagram.com/debutsounds"
21,POLITICS,Ted Talks In New Hampshire: Can Ted Cruz Cajole His Way Into 2016 Contention?,Scott Conroy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-new-hampshire-2016_n_6965412.html,,2015-03-29,"MERRIMACK, NH - MARCH 27: U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks at a Conservative Business League of New Hampshire Rally March 27, 2015 in Merrimack, New Hampshire. Cruz is the first politician to have officially announced his run for president in the upcoming election. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8efbf240000500098fd6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NASHUA, N.H. -- When he's out on the campaign trail in public view, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) likes his hair gel extra-shiny, his wife and two adorable daughters close to his side, and a microphone attached to his body at all times.The former college debate national champion knows a little something about presentation, and image-crafting was entwined in every movement he made during his first swing through New Hampshire as a newly minted presidential candidate on Friday and Saturday.At times, he risked laying it on a little too thick. During his first appearance at a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Merrimack, for instance, Cruz was already decked out in a headset microphone as he waded through a crowd of supporters who wanted to talk to him one-on-one for a few moments before he took the stage. New Hampshire voters are used to seeing presidential candidates try to ingratiate themselves with locals by wearing plaid shirts, sweater vests and all other manner of hokey adornments, but the effect of Cruz's decision to glad-hand with headgear made him look more like a telemarketer than a White House aspirant. At no point during his two-day swing through the first-in-the-nation primary state did Cruz ever appear in public without a microphone attached to his person. But as strange as it looked, for Cruz, maintaining the ability to electronically amplify his voice at any moment is a crutch befitting his biggest asset as a candidate: his mouth. In what is expected to be an extremely crowded field of GOP contenders who will each bring to the 2016 table a set of unique strengths, Cruz can outtalk them all. The man knows how to give a speech, but how he ultimately fares in his uphill campaign climb remains an open question, as Cruz is perhaps the biggest wildcard, equally capable of flaming out or catching fire. He is a first-term senator with a negligible national organization, a shaky relationship with the party establishment that has determined each Republican nominee for the past half-century and a scant record of legislative achievement.In short, the current Republican candidate of the moment appears in some ways to be poised to fade from relevance in the presidential equation faster than you can say ""Michele Bachmann.""But anyone inclined to underestimate his chances would do well to remember Cruz's long-shot 2012 Senate bid that ended in a victory that shocked just about everyone but Cruz himself.As a Princeton and Harvard-educated lawyer, he is savvy enough to know that being the smartest guy in the room isn't necessarily the ticket to the top tier. For Cruz, it's all about playing the right tune to the right crowd at the right time. In watching him wow three entirely different Republican constituencies in New Hampshire over the weekend, it wasn't hard to imagine a scenario in which Cruz could use strong performances in the upcoming primary debates as a springboard to victory in Iowa and an ultimate emergence as the conservative alternative to whichever 2016 contender earns the GOP establishment's backing. His first stop in Merrimack on Friday provided a chance to thrive in his most natural environment: among a sea of mad-as-hell, hardcore conservative activists who were eager to be fed as many slabs of red meat as Cruz could pack into one speech. Setting the tone for the event was Jack Kimball -- the intensely controversial former New Hampshire GOP chairman, who has since mortified many of the Granite State Republicans he once presided over with his call to arrest President Barack Obama and penchant for spreading bizarre conspiracy theories online, including his belief that the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris were faked. Even some of Kimball's like-minded conservatives had heard enough, as he tested the upper levels of the public-address system's range while introducing Cruz. ""Jack, you've got a microphone,"" one man in the crowd snickered to no one in particular. ""You don't need to yell.""After Kimball relinquished the stage to the candidate, there was no such pushback. Cruz didn't need to shout to rev up these true believers. (He was, after all, already wearing his microphone.)As he paced the stage with the deliberative gait of an evangelist preaching to the faithful, the familiar lines poured from Cruz's mouth as effortlessly as if he were placing a series of phone calls asking potential customers for ""just a moment of your time"" or imploring them to ""act now, before it's too late!""But the success rate of Cruz's pitch was far better than any 1-800 number salesman could ever aspire to achieve. ""I am convinced, come 2017, a new president in the White House is going to sign legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,"" Cruz said, inspiring a man near the front of the crowd to extend his arms and reach for the heavens. Hallelujah! Later that night, however, Cruz struck an entirely different tone as he addressed a conference of college-age conservatives who had gathered in this Boston exurb for a weekend of political confabbing, free food and adolescent flirting conducted in ill-fitting business attire. Instinctively, Cruz picked up on the dynamic that this was an entirely different kind of crowd than the ""Don't Tread On Me"" T-shirt-wearing and concealed-carry set that had greeted him in Merrimack, and he adjusted his style and substance accordingly. He joked about the disparaging portrayal of him in the HBO vampire series ""True Blood,"" took a stab at a goofy Jay Leno impression and boasted about how he had co-opted Obama's winning 2008 campaign strategy to find success in his own Senate bid.And then he took a broadside at a particularly abhorrent foe: old people. ""I think every young person, after you go in to vote, oughta walk out and punch your parents in the nose,"" Cruz said. ""I mean, it is as if your parents went out and took a credit card in your name [and] said, 'Savannah, we're going to Vegas. We're going to party it up, we're having a great time, and guess what? You get to pay the bill!'""On Saturday morning, Cruz headed to the tony seacoast region where he delivered remarks to the navy blue sport coat and khaki pants-wearing set, timed to begin at the civilized brunching hour of 11 a.m. His lapel microphone already in place, Cruz took to the room adjoining the golf course, where he trumpeted his ideas for a flat tax, won a standing ovation in affirming his support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and earned some mimosa-infused chortles for his excoriation of the political press.""Wow,"" Cruz said in response to the crowd's rousing greeting. ""With that kind of reception, it's almost like you all don't read The New York Times!"" What Cruz didn't mention was that, just a few minutes earlier, he had been standing in a different area of the same country club, ignoring an aide's entreaties to stay on schedule, as he answered just one more question from a New York Times reporter. As downright affable as his relationship with the political press who trailed him all weekend was, nothing goes better with scrambled eggs at a well-heeled Republican brunch than a heaping side of media bashing, and Cruz was not shy about indulging.Still, no one knows better than the candidate himself that if he has any legitimate hope of rising out of the single digits in the polls and becoming a significant factor in the race, he will need the media -- and not just the conservative media -- to help him get his message out. Cruz is even adjusting his schedule to ensure he has all the time he needs to talk to reporters on the trail at every turn. ""I want to have a good relationship with the press -- it doesn't pay not to -- and Ted wants to have good relations with the press,"" said Cruz's spokesman, Rick Tyler. ""One of the discussions we had today, frankly, is we need to build more time for the movements in going from one place to another because he's just not going to move. He's just going to take every question.""If Cruz fails to catch on, it won't be for a lack of energy. Unlike other candidates who tend to become visibly exhausted after several hours of give-and-take, Cruz never once seemed to tire during his first foray onto the 2016 campaign trail. This is, after all, a man who once stood for 21 hours straight on the Senate floor to deliver the filibuster that helped turn him into a national conservative icon. Soon, the presidential stage that this born showman has had to himself for the past week will be crowded with a dozen or so other serious 2016 contenders.And each of them will move quickly to challenge Cruz on whether his gift for gab is what the Republican Party is craving eight years after another charismatic first-term senator ascended to the White House on the back of his speechmaking prowess. But so far, at least, Ted Cruz has ridden his rhetorical prowess to a strong start. ""It's so scary because I just feel like the whole country's going in a way where we're forgetting all of our rights,"" said Claire Lester, who said that she could ""definitely"" see herself voting for Cruz after hearing him speak on Saturday. ""I feel like we're the patriots that have to revolt to switch it around."" "
22,RELIGION,Researchers Can Actually Measure The 'Pope Francis Effect',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-effect-data_n_6941824.html,,2015-03-29,"In this March 21, 2015 pool photo, made available Monday, March 23, 2015, Pope Francis wears a helmet as he meets youths in Naples, Italy. Pope Francis made an impassioned defense of the unemployed during a speech to people in the poor Neapolitan neighborhood of Scampia Saturday. (AP Photo/L'Osservatore Romano, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fdbb1f0000df00252e50.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Pope Francis appears more popular than ever among American Catholics, and he hasn’t even visited the U.S. yet, a trip that is planned for September and could well boost his visibility — and appeal — even further.But will Francis find American Catholics filling the pews? Or just loving the pope from afar? That’s one of the big — and so far unanswered — questions about his remarkable papacy.Now, one researcher may have found some signs, albeit tentative, of an incipient “Francis effect.”Mark Gray of Georgetown University’s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate crunched the Catholic numbers from the 2014 General Social Survey, the go-to resource for sociologists. The GSS began in 1972 and is conducted every two years using face-to-face interviews with a national random sample of adults.Gray noted that when asked to characterize the strength of their religious affiliation, 34 percent of Catholics said it was “strong,” up from 27 percent in 2012, the year before Francis was elected. That 7-point rise was a “significant bounce,” Gray said.There was also a decline in the percentage saying their affiliation with the Catholic Church was “not very strong,” down 6 points, to 56 percent.“Again, this is not a massive shift by any means but it breaks a trend of consistently declining numbers of Catholics saying their affiliation is ‘strong’ in the last decade,” Gray wrote in a post on CARA’s blog.Another marker of the strength of Catholicism, and any religion, is the retention rate — that is, the percentage of those raised in a faith who remain as adults.Gray noted that the retention rate for Catholicism has been steadily declining since the early 1970s, from a high in the mid-80s to a low of 65 percent in 2012.But the 2014 GSS showed that the rate remained steady for the first time. “Given recent history, even holding steady is an interesting result,” Gray said.The endurance of Catholicism is also in contrast to the affiliation rates for Protestants and other Christians, which continue to decline sharply, dipping below 50 percent in 2014 for the first time.The numbers on Catholic identity and enthusiasm track those found in other public opinion surveys, such as a Pew Research Center poll conducted a year ago, in February 2014.Even so, neither the Pew survey nor the GSS data show any bump in Mass attendance, which is viewed as the surest benchmark of success for a pope who sees evangelization and outreach as the priority for the church, and his pontificate.Yet the Pew survey showed that those who already go to church regularly were the most energized by the new pope.“This suggests that if there was a ‘Francis effect,’ in the first year of his papacy, it was most pronounced among Catholics who were already highly committed to the practice of their faith,” Jessica Martinez of the Pew Research Center told reporters earlier this month.The upshot: “The best news from the GSS for the church in 2014 is that some worrisome trends have halted,” Gray wrote.But, he continued, “it will take another survey wave or two of consistent results to discern a real course ‘correction’ in the data,” he said. “This survey could be an outlier.”"

Tens of thousands lined the streets on Sunday to see the coffin of England's Richard III taken in procession to his final burial, five centuries after his battlefield death.

The public ceremony will be respectful and uncontroversial. Archaeologists will not write angry editorials, sign petitions or organize protests about Richard III, who died 530 years ago.Richard III's body was a treasure house for science and history. Discovered in 2012 under a Leicester parking lot, the skeleton of the last English monarch to die in battle quickly became the subject of intense public scrutiny. The archaeological study of the remains provided vital historical answers to the king's controversial life and death. Just several bones and teeth offered science a wealth of data about the king's origins, movements, lifestyle and diet. Yet, Richard III's fate was not to be preserved in a museum but returned to a grave. The silence of scientists on Richard III's reburial is deafening. It stands in stark contrast to how so many regard the reburial of Native American human remains in museums. Around the world archaeologists have resisted the return of skeletons for decades -- arguing that they are needed for science. Even nearly 25 years after the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act  became federal law, only 27% of the Native skeletons in U.S. museums have been offered for return. More than 100,000 skeletons continue to sit on shelves. In Europe, only in the last few years have the first sets of Native American remains come home. Then again, the silence is not especially surprising. The double standard for White and Indian bodies has a long and established tradition. In 1923, a Chicago journalist named Edward Page Gaston grabbed international headlines in a search for the body of the legendary ""Indian-Princess"" Pocahontas who died in England. In a kind of archaeological dragnet Gaston dug up 100 dead reposing in a cemetery. Britons didn't mind the search for the Indian royalty, but the disturbance of their own bloodlines was too much. Authorities stopped the excavation and reburied the dead.In 1971, a cemetery was discovered during an Iowa road project. Archaeologists arrived. They excavated 27 skeletons dating to the 1800s. Based on the grave goods, 26 people were deemed white. They were placed in new caskets and swiftly reburied in a local cemetery. The last body, a young woman, was believed to be Native American. She was boxed up and taken to the Iowa state archaeologist for study.These attitudes explain why museums across the U.S. and around the world are still filled with the remains of American Indians.By the late 1980s, most archaeologists conceded that Native Americans should be able to rebury blood relatives. The parallel here with Richard III jumps out: His family's living relatives donated their DNA for identification and, although some disputed the location of his final resting place, helped direct the king's reburial. And yet, to reduce the argument to biology only extends the injustice against Native Americans. Recent genetic studies do prove that some Native peoples' can trace their ancestry back thousands of years to people buried in their own backyard. But, the belief that a responsibility for an ancestor comes from biological connection is distinct to Western thought and law. Many Native Americans feel their ancestry is shaped as much by place (anyone who lived in their homeland), interconnectedness (all Native Americans came into being together), and spirituality (the dead, if disturbed, can harm the living). Western cultural norms should not exclusively dictate how Native Americans are allowed to be stewards of their own past. I am heartened that the descendants of King Richard III were able to rebury their ancestor. Perhaps those in England and beyond might now offer the Indian dead the same respect. As the Leicester city mayor said, speaking of the king, ""It's now our opportunity to put it right and to make sure this time that it's done with dignity and honour."" Why should Native Americans be treated any different?

(Photo by Wail Shaif Thabet/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14865240000320076f375.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mohammed Mukhashaf and Sami AboudiADEN, March 29 (Reuters) - Yemeni fighters loyal to the Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi clashed with Iranian-allied Houthi fighters on Sunday in downtown Aden, the absent leader's last major foothold in the country.Hadi loyalists in the southern port city reported a gun battle in the central Crater district in which three people were killed, and said they recaptured the airport, which has changed hands several times in the last five days of fighting.The Health Ministry, loyal to the Houthi fighters who control the capital, said Saudi-led air strikes had killed 35 people and wounded 88 overnight. The figures could not be independently confirmed.The Houthi fighters, representing a Shi'ite minority that makes up around a third of Yemen's population, emerged as the most powerful force in the Arab world's poorest country last year when they captured the capital Sanaa.Saudi Arabia has rallied Sunni Muslim Arab countries in an air campaign to support Hadi, who relocated to Aden in February and is now in Riyadh after leaving Yemen in the past week. The fighting has brought civil war to a country that was already sliding into chaos and which had been a battlefield for the secret U.S. drone war against al Qaeda.In the eastern province of Shabwa, tribal sources said armed tribesmen were fighting a major battle with the Houthis and their army allies at a military base, killing around 30 Houthis. This also could not be independently confirmed.Saudi-led coalition warplanes struck military targets at airports in the capital Sanaa and in Hodeida, the main Red Sea port.In the northern city of Saada, a Houthi stronghold near the Saudi border, strikes hit Houthi military bases belonging to the militia and their ally, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh who still controls most army units.Saleh stood down after a 2011 uprising but still wields wide influence in Yemen. He appealed on Saturday to Arab leaders meeting in Egypt to halt their four-day offensive and resume talks on political transition in Yemen, promising that neither he nor his relatives would seek the presidency.In an apparent rebuttal, a Yemeni official said Hadi had sacked Saleh's son as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates.Saudi Arabia's military intervention, is the latest front in its widening contest with Iran for power in the region, a proxy struggle also playing out in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.Iran denies accusations from Sunni Gulf rulers that it has armed the Houthis, who follow the Zaidi branch of Shi'ite Islam.Zaidi Shi'ites led a thousand-year kingdom in Yemen until 1962. Former leader Saleh himself is a member of the sect, although he sought to crush the Houthis while in office, only allying himself with them after his downfall. FIGHTING IN ADEN CENTERAcross the country, there were heavy clashes in seven southern and eastern provinces between the Houthis and pro-Saleh army units on the one hand, against Sunni tribesmen, pro-Hadi loyalists and armed southern separatists on the other.Fighters loyal to Hadi said on Sunday they recaptured Aden airport after fighting which lasted all night. Heavy fighting in the area during the last week meant that foreign diplomats had to be evacuated from the city by boat, ferried by Saudi naval vessels to the Red Sea port of Jeddah on Saturday.Witnesses in Aden's northern Dar Saad district reported seeing two tanks destroyed by Hadi loyalists battling army units who are fighting alongside the Houthis. Five members of the Shi'ite militia were killed in the suburbs, loyalists said.In comments addressed to Arab heads of state meeting in Egypt, Saleh appealed to the Saudi-led coalition on Saturday to stop ""the aggression and return to the negotiations table,"" saying Hadi had failed to run the country.""Let's go to dialog and elections, and I promise you that neither I nor any of my relatives will run for the presidency.""But in public at least, Saudi Arabia and Yemeni officials loyal to Hadi appeared to give Saleh short shrift.Saudi Arabia's King Salman told the summit that military operations would continue until their objectives were achieved.Hadi's Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen said: ""We are not thinking about dialog in the present time until the conditions are arranged on the ground.""In a rare move, Saudi-owned television channel Al-Arabiya broadcast a detailed account of what it said was a proposal last week to the Saudi leadership by Saleh's son Ahmed to head off military intervention by breaking with the Houthis.It said two days before the Saudi-led campaign began, Ahmed Saleh offered in a meeting with Saudi Defense Minister Prince Mohammad bin Salman to organize a coup against the Houthis.In return, the channel said, Saleh requested U.N. sanctions on his father be lifted, immunity be granted to him and his father, and media campaigns against his father be halted.Al-Arabiya said Prince Mohammad rejected the proposal. ""There must be a return to legitimacy in the form of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to lead Yemen from the capital Sanaa,"" it quoted him as saying.

To start off the new season on the right foot, a little spring cleaning for your food supply might be in order. We talked with the Nutrition Twins (AKA Lyssie Lakatos and Tammy Lakatos-Shames) authors of The Nutrition Twins' Veggie Cure, for their top tips to whip your kitchen into shape.Declutter Your FreezerIf you throw foods in the freezer and forget about them, it's time to clear out the old build up. Get rid of all the items with ice crystals forming on the food or the packaging. ""Anything with freezer burn will taste worse, but it also often means that the nutrients are lost from foods, especially produce,"" says Lakatos.Keep some uncooked protein, like lean beef and chicken; it's good for up to nine months once frozen, and can help you skip a midweek trip to the grocery store. Fill the rest of your freezer with bags of frozen berries and peaches (to throw in smoothies, yogurt and hot cereals) and vegetables like peas, spinach and broccoli (to add to soups and increase the nutrition of takeout dishes). Want to keep a few microwavable meals on hand for times you need a quick fix? Look for options with fewer than 400 calories and 400 mg of sodium, suggests Lakatos-Shames.Lighten Up Your FridgeEven with tons of frozen fruits and veggies in your freezer, you'll want some fresh varieties as well. Aim for foods that will keep for several days in the fridge, such as apples, oranges, cauliflower and cabbage. ""Don't cut up anything or wash produce when you bring it home from the store,"" says Lakatos-Shames. ""You might think you're saving time, but it will make everything go bad much sooner."" To make these items more convenient for packed lunches or snacks, she suggests prepping them only the night before you'll be consuming them.Swap out creamy condiments like salad dressings, mayo and sour cream for mustards, Greek yogurt or olive oil with balsamic vinegar or lemon juice. And always have a carton of eggs for quick-cooking protein that goes well with any meal or snack.Clean Your CupboardThere's more to junk food than potato chips. Toss items packed with sugar, sodium and preservatives, such as pretzels and most granola bars and energy bars. ""Many of these really aren't any better for you than a candy bar,"" says Lakatos. Instead, reach for options like air-popped popcorn (you can munch on three cups of it for only 100 calories) and pistachios -- they're only about three calories apiece, and shelling them slows down your eating, encouraging you to consume less.Trade in high-sugar cereals -- and keep in mind that even healthy-seeming choices like granola and gluten-free options can fall into this category -- for oatmeal flavored with cinnamon and fruit. Load up on whole grains like quinoa, brown rice and wheat pasta; low-sodium beans for a punch of protein and fiber; and cans of fatty fish like tuna, sardines and salmon to get those omega-3s.Put Everything In Its PlaceTo ensure your healthy habits stick, it's important to put some thought into the way you store your foods. ""From the pantry to the fridge, place the nutrient-dense items at eye level, front and center, and put any treats in the back,"" suggests Lakatos-Shames. ""That way, you have to really dig for the less healthy items."" And make sure that everything is in the correct place to stay at its peak freshness. ""Most people know that olive oil is packed with powerful phytonutrients and antioxidants,"" says Lakatos. ""What you might not be aware of is that those antioxidants convert to pro-oxidants when the oil exposed to heat over a prolonged period of time -- which means consuming it can actually damage your body."" She suggests refrigerating olive oil as soon as you get home. Same thing goes for anything containing healthy fats, such as nuts, nut butters and fish oil in any form.Stocking your kitchen with nutritious choices is the first step to healthy eating -- and arranging your storage areas in a way that encourages you to reach for them ensures the kickoff to a slim new season.More from Life by DailyBurn: 12 Brilliant Meal Prep Ideas To Free Up Your Time The Dirty Dozen: What To Buy Organic 13 Quick And Easy Protein Shake Recipes"

The event aims to highlight the role that agriculture plays in Iowa and the rest of the world. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8efaa2100002501c96d30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) is now apparently undecided how he'll buy insurance, backing away from his Obamacare announcement earlier in the week. Either way, Cruz is a master at what Al Franken used to call ""weasel words"" -- talking points that are carefully constructed to sound legitimate but really aren't at all. Come to think of it, Stephen Colbert famously referred to this sort of thing as ""truthiness."" Cruz is especially on his game when the topic of the complicated Affordable Care Act comes up because even top-shelf reporters don't quite grasp all of the ins and outs of Obamacare and, frankly, the administration hasn't been very strong at educating the public about what the law covers. And Cruz is exploiting every square mile of this supercolossal Obamacare ignorance gap.For the last two days or so, Ted Cruz has repeatedly said that 1) as a member of the Senate, he's required to have an Obamacare policy, 2) in spite of this requirement he was on his wife's insurance policy until just recently, and 3) Congress is exempt from Obamacare because of an illegal move by the president. So, Obamacare is mandatory now, but it wasn't before, and it's actually not any more because of the allegedly ""illegal"" Obama exemption.On Wednesday, Cruz sat down with a reporter from an outfit called The Daily Signal and delivered this troika of nonsense once again.1) First, Cruz again described how for two years he's been on his wife's insurance -- not an apparently mandatory congressional Obamacare plan.When I announced the campaign, my wife also decided to take an unpaid leave of absence from her job. We have been for the past couple of years covered on my wife's health insurance. When she took an unpaid leave of absence, it means that she's also losing her benefits. And so we're gonna do what anyone else would do, which is take their health insurance from their employer. So, in all likelihood, we'll go on the exchange.2) After discussing so-called ""Obama subsidies,"" Cruz then described why Obamacare is a requirement for members of Congress.Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley introduced an amendment to Obamacare that said members of Congress have to be on the exchanges with no subsidies just like millions of Americans. So, the ""amendment"" stipulates that members ""have to be on the exchanges with no subsidies."" When he first mentioned this to CNN's Dana Bash on Tuesday, he said it was ""one of the great things about Obamacare."" Then why is he still not on the exchange? It's because members of Congress really don't ""have to"" use Obamacare -- unless they choose employer-based health insurance from the government. If they do, the government's plan is now the Healthcare.gov exchange rather than the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. If members and staffers don't want employer coverage, they can buy a plan directly from a provider or go without insurance. On top of all that, there's absolutely nothing in the Affordable Care Act that says Congress isn't permitted to receive subsidies or premium-sharing. Nothing. Cruz lied. 3) Next, even though he said he plans to follow the law (he hasn't for two years now, but okay) which he claims features an Obamacare requirement, he goes on to say that Congress doesn't have to use Obamacare after all because the White House carved out an exemption for Congress.Now, Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats when this passed were horrified. They didn't wanna be under Obamacare. They went to Obama and said, ""Give us a special exemption."" And Barack Obama did, and his administration ignored the plain text of the statute and created an illegal exemption. I have no intention of using that illegal exemption. I'm gonna follow the law.Inexplicably, he wants viewers to think Congress is no longer mandated to be on Obamacare (it never was) -- that Congress has an ""illegal"" waiver to get around Grassley's amendment. In fact, the spirit of Grassley's language is still intact and in effect. The ""exemption"" is, in reality, the Office of Personnel Management's decision to continue to cover 72 percent of the premium costs for Congress and its staffers -- just like both the government and private businesses alike always have. There was no ""plain text of the statute"" to ignore because, to repeat, there's nothing in the law that says Congress can't have a premium sharing employer benefit. While we're here, let's get to the bottom of who lobbied the administration for this so-called ""exemption."" Politico reported that it was a collaboration between Harry Reid and Senate Democrat John Boehner. Wait. Boehner's not a Senate Democrat like Cruz said. He's the Republican Speaker of the House. It was a completely bipartisan move that included both the White House and congressional leaders. Let's clear another thing up. Grassley merely proposed an amendment that failed. The Democrats later resurrected and adapted the idea and wrote it into the body of the law. Grassley only deserves partial credit for the rule, since it was ultimately a Democratic decision.More weasel words from Cruz:So suddenly the media goes, ""Hahahaha! Gotcha!"" Because Cruz is now signing up for Obamacare. Listen, I have zero intention of take any government subsidy or Obama subsidy. Rather, what I'm gonna do is pay on the marketplace for health insurance for my family, just like millions of Americans.Well, he won't get a subsidy because he earns significantly more than 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level -- the upper limit to receive premium subsidies. Notice, though, that he didn't say ""premium sharing"" or ""cost sharing"" or ""employer contribution."" He said ""subsidy."" Why would he go on the Obamacare exchange, a politically dangerous move, other than for the better deal: comparable benefits and continued employer premium sharing, just like his wife's old plan? If he intends, on the other hand, to pay his premium dues entirely out-of-pocket without any premium sharing, why didn't he just enroll in COBRA through Goldman Sachs or buy insurance directly from a provider, sidestepping the political mess he's in? Obviously because he wants the premium sharing, which technically isn't a subsidy but rather a employee benefit -- just like millions of Americans receive through their employers. It's one thing to abide by a law you don't like, which happens all the time, but it's another thing entirely to abide by a law you don't like even though you have numerous alternative options to choose from. Instead, he chose Obamacare, which he hates, and, worse, he clearly plans to accept the premium sharing ""exemption"" that he keeps saying was an illegal plot by the Senate Democrats. Why is he doing this? Because it's a fantastic deal and, financially, he'd be insane not to take it. Politically, however, it was a massive blunder. You know why the press is saying ""gotcha!"" right now? Because Cruz just blindly derped his way into a gigantic bear trap -- an unforced error -- and now he's trying to weasel out of it._______________Subscribe for free to the Bob & Chez Show podcast with special thanks to April Cockerham.Cross-posted at The Daily Banter."
34,WORLDPOST,Finland's Schools Are Overhauling The Way They Do Things. Here's How,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/finland-education-overhaul_n_6958786.html,,2015-03-28,"(FILES) This file picture dated 17 August 2005 shows children listening to their teacher in a primary school in Vaasa, on the second day of school in Finland. Finnish, South Korean and Taipei 15-year-olds scored highest in the world on tests of science, reading and maths knowledge, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced 04 December 2007. Finland topped the science results, with a score of 563, followed by Hong Kong, with 542, and Canada, at 534. AFP PHOTO OLIVIER MORIN (Photo credit should read OLIVIER MORIN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1485e2400006800382ab9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Finland’s education system, often held up as an exemplary model for the rest of the world, is on the verge of making some major changes.For years, Finland has led the pack in international test scores, becoming a source of fascination for education policymakers and experts. Now, the country is changing the way it teaches students. Going forward, Finnish schools will be placing less emphasis on individual subjects like math and history, and will instead focus on broader, more interdisciplinary topics. The goal, according to Finnish leaders, is to provide students with the necessary skills for a more technological, global society. Here are three things you need to know about Finland’s changing education system: 1. Finland Is Instituting “Phenomenon-Based Teaching”Finnish schools will begin reorganizing their classrooms during the 2016-2017 school year based on the country's new National Curriculum Framework. Some classrooms in Helsinki, the country’s largest city, have already begun the process, according to The Independent. The National Curriculum Framework serves as a broad outline for educators, and requires that for at least a couple of weeks each year, educators use “phenomenon-based teaching"" -- an approach that emphasizes broad interdisciplinary topics rather than single-subject classes. Instead of teaching about history or economics, for example, educators could give lessons on the European Union, blending aspects of history and economics, according to The Independent. Schools and localities will be given some degree of freedom over how they implement this method of teaching. In a video posted to the website of the Finnish National Board of Education, Irmeli Halinen, the board's head of curriculum development, says that Finnish students will need to keep up with a changing world that is more technological and global and that faces challenges associated with sustainability.“We are often asked, 'Why improve the system that has been ranked as top quality?' The answer is, 'Because the world is changing around the school,'” Halinen says in the video. “We have to think and rethink everything connected to school. We also have to understand that competencies needed in society and working life have changed and they are changing rapidly.""Later in the video, Halinen explains that being good at one specific subject is not enough in the changing world, and that students must be able to apply their skills and knowledge to a multitude of contexts.“It is great if you’re good in math or in music, but it’s not good enough,” says Halinen. “It’s not enough, not in today's world and not in the future.”2. Students Will Be Involved In Helping To Plan LessonsFinland’s students will be involved in planning these new, interdisciplinary projects, and will be expected to evaluate their success.“Some teachers in Finland see this current reform as a threat and the wrong way to improve teaching and learning in schools,"" wrote Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish education expert, in a blog post reprinted in The Washington Post Thursday. ""Other teachers think that breaking down the dominance of traditional subjects and isolation of teaching is an opportunity to [effect] more fundamental change in schools.""3. There Will Be An Emphasis On Student CollaborationFinnish classrooms will literally be redesigned under the new curriculum framework. Instead of a traditional classroom, where kids sit in rows of desks in front of a teacher, students in the near future will work in clusters to promote communication skills, says The Independent. A press release from the Finnish National Board of Education also notes that the new approach will emphasize the ""joy of learning.""“The core curriculum is based on the learning conception that positive emotional experiences, collaborative working and interaction as well as creative activity enhance learning,” says the press release.

This week, the 2016 race welcomed Ted Cruz to the GOP scrum after the U.S. senator from Texas made his presidential ambitions clear to a literally captive audience of Liberty University students. He's been immediately anointed as a long shot, but is he really?Listen to this week's ""So, That Happened"" below:* * *Some highlights from this week:“There’s been a pervasive theory in politics that harnessing the full power of evangelical voters can change election results. I’m skeptical about whether the evangelical vote is that powerful. I’m also skeptical about whether their vote is that monolithic.” -- Jason LinkinsMeanwhile, there are other places in the world besides America. How are things going there, and what does it mean for us? We'll talk about elections in Israel, unrest in Yemen and -- I hesitate to even say this aloud -- a potentially hopeful turn in Afghanistan, graveyard of empires.“Whether or not Netanyahu believes in the two-state solution, I think, is irrelevant to the Obama administration. More what it is, he based his next few years as prime minister on the promise that there will be no Palestinian state.” -- Jessica Schulberg“President Ghani’s speech was almost reminiscent of the Bibi speech. People were so excited to see him. He got Congress to laugh, a total crowd-pleaser.” -- Ali WatkinsFinally, as if you needed something even more surreal and complicated in your lives, we're going to talk about seigniorage, the minting of dollar coins, the minting of platinum coins, the eternally ephemeral nature of the concept of money and -- strangely enough -- whether Europeans are terrible people.“I’m pretty much with Vitter on the policy issue. I think the seigniorage stuff is not important. If we want to come up with an imaginary $5.5 billion, we can do that in other imaginary ways. That's how money works.” -- Zach Carter* * *""So, That Happened"" is available on iTunes.
