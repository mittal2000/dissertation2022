Trump has had an ongoing feud with Kelly since she questioned his sexist attacks against women during a debate in August. Fox News said the war of words escalated behind the scenes over the weekend during a call with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. In a statement released to Politico on Tuesday night, the conservative news network claimed: ""In a call on Saturday with a Fox News executive, Lewandowski stated that Megyn 'had a rough couple days after that last debate' and he 'would hate to have her go through that again.' Lewandowski was warned not to level any more threats, but he continued to do so.""""We can't give into terrorizations toward any of our employees,"" the network said. Fox News said the GOP frontrunner for president spent four days lobbying to have Kelly replaced, but they refused to give in to his demands.""Capitulating to politicians' ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards,"" the network said.Trump is still welcome to join the debate ""but he can't dictate the moderators or the questions."" The latest statement is a sharp turn from one released earlier in the day, which took more of a humorous tone. According to The New York Times, Fox News initially said: “We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president — a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.”Writing on Twitter, Trump dismissed that earlier statement as a ""pathetic attempt by @foxnews to try and build up ratings for the #GOPDebate. Without me they'd have no ratings!""At the time of this writing, Trump has not yet commented on the latest statement accusing his campaign manager of threatening Kelly. "

""Sorry, Star mag, but you got us confused with the cooler version of us. Congrats to John and Emily!

4,POLITICS,"The Bernie Sanders Health Plan Is Too Good To Be True, Analyst Says",Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sanders-health-plan-cost_us_56a8ff99e4b0f6b7d5447ee8,The Democratic hopeful could be wildly underestimating how much it would cost.,2016-01-27,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) promised a sweet deal on health care, but his numbers are getting serious scrutiny now.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a8ffff1a00002d00ab16d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Bernie Sanders released his universal health care plan last week, promising that most people would receive more generous insurance coverage while paying less for medical care, most policy experts said it sounded too good to be true. Now, a veteran health economist has produced a more serious assessment of Sanders' proposal and concluded that the critics were right. According to analysis from Emory University professor Kenneth Thorpe, a former Clinton administration advisor who has also done paid work for health industry clients, Sanders has wildly underestimated the cost of providing such comprehensive benefits to all Americans. Either his plan would blow a giant hole in the deficit, Thorpe predicts, or the new payroll and income taxes to finance the proposal would be more than twice as high as the Sanders campaign has projected. Either way, Thorpe says, the Sanders plan would create both winners and losers, as any health reform proposal would. The winners would include workers for whom the new taxes would still be less than what they pay now, in premiums and out-of-pocket costs combined. The losers would include some Medicaid recipients with jobs, because their employers would pass along the expense of new payroll taxes as lower wages.Thorpe’s analysis is preliminary, and the exact mix of people better or worse off financially would depend on a bunch of factors, not least among them the still-fuzzy details of how the Sanders plan would pay doctors, hospitals and drugmakers. But under Thorpe’s assumptions, which he says take into account the difficulty of imposing the Sanders plan on existing U.S. health care infrastructure, 71 percent of working households that now have private insurance would end up paying more for their health care if Sanders had his way. The Sanders campaign, which says that its plan would benefit 95 percent of Americans, is sharply disputing the analysis. Warren Gunnels, a senior policy advisor on the campaign, told The Huffington Post that Thorpe's estimate was a ""complete hatchet job"" and said it was ""disappointing, but not surprising,"" given Thorpe's past work for industry.So how did Thorpe get those figures? And why are they so different from the estimates that economist Gerald Friedman, from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, produced for the Sanders campaign? It’s all about the assumptions that each analyst made.Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has proposed to create a single-payer system -- that is, he would wipe out current insurance arrangements and put in their place a single federal insurance program that would cover everybody. The plan would have automatic enrollment so that it would truly cover just about everybody, even those who haven’t signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Sanders calls his proposal a “Medicare-for-all” plan, but the insurance he proposes to give all Americans would nearly eliminate out-of-pocket spending, making the benefit package more generous that what most people with either private insurance or Medicare have now.Covering more people and providing most of them with more generous benefits obviously requires a lot of money. But single-payer systems abroad manage to provide generous, universal coverage for much less than the U.S. spends -- because those foreign systems fritter away less money on administrative waste and profit, and because they give governments the power to set medical prices and salaries at much lower levels than the U.S. currently pays.Taking those prospective savings into account, Friedman determined in his analysis, a single-payer system could dramatically reduce health care spending. That, in turn, would make it possible to finance the Sanders plan with payroll taxes of 6.2 percent plus an “income-related premium” (basically, an income tax) of 2.2 percent. That’d still be a lot of money, to be sure, but Friedman concluded that it would be less than what most people pay now in combined premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The one group consistently paying a lot more would be the wealthy, since the Sanders plan would jack up their taxes to provide additional financing.When the Sanders campaign released its plan and the accompanying analysis, Friedman was candid about the limits of his projection, particularly when it came to grappling with political and policy-related complications. “The pleasure of being an academic is I can just spell things out and leave the details to others,” Friedman told reporters at the time. “The details very quickly get very messy.”Thorpe attempted to adjust for that messiness -- and found that, in order to pay for itself, Sanders would have to set the payroll tax at 14.3 percent and the income-related premium at 5.7 percent. Both tax hikes would be more than double what the Sanders campaign has said it would impose.A big reason for the disparity, Thorpe said, would be that upgrade in benefits, since it would mean the government was paying for expenses that individuals with private insurance and Medicare currently pay out of their own pockets. The benefits upgrade would also boost spending indirectly, since people with lower out-of-pocket spending tend to consume more medical services. According to Thorpe, the Sanders analysis didn’t fully take into account these costs.Thorpe also assumed that the new government insurance plan Sanders envisions would pay for medical services at roughly 105 percent of cost -- in other words, at 5 percent above what providers like hospitals need just to cover their expenses. That’s less than private insurance now pays, but more than Medicare and a lot more than Medicaid. Again, Thorpe said, Friedman’s analysis doesn’t adjust appropriately for that likely expense.In theory, an insurance program like the one Sanders has sketched out could hold down costs by putting a lot more pressure on doctors, hospitals and drugmakers to deliver lower prices -- and, perhaps, by limiting access to services and drugs. In practice, Thorpe says, doing so in the U.S. would require dramatic changes that neither the health care industry nor the public would tolerate, at least in one fell swoop. And that, Thorpe told HuffPost, makes the Sanders plan “completely implausible” without major changes.Thorpe has been producing estimates like these since the 1990s, when he worked with then-first lady Hillary Clinton on crafting the reform bill that the administration tried and failed to get through Congress.But Thorpe told HuffPost that he conducted his analysis on his own initiative. And his assumptions about the difficulties of imposing a single-payer system in the U.S. -- particularly the challenges of wringing huge efficiencies out of providers -- are broadly consistent with what most health policy experts believe. ""Under a single-payer plan, the government would set prices paid to doctor, hospitals and drug companies,"" said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Whether or not that would produce huge savings in overall health care spending is more a matter of faith than economic analysis.""Of course, Thorpe's analysis is as subject to scrutiny and second-guessing as anybody's. Friedman told HuffPost that, based on a cursory inspection of the report, he thinks Thorpe made several overly pessimistic assumptions -- underestimating the savings from reduction in billing transactions and insurance overhead, for example, and slightly overestimating the generosity of benefits that Sanders has in mind. Friedman also thinks Thorpe didn't sufficiently account for savings from the cheaper drug prices a single-payer plan could achieve.Still, Friedman noted, “Kenneth Thorpe is a serious scholar and his contribution to this dialogue is most welcome.”"
5,POLITICS,Black People Ticketed For Not Wearing Seat Belts In Florida Twice As Often As Whites,Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-seat-belt-law-racial-disparity_us_56a8f6efe4b0f71799289fb1,An ACLU report finds the racial disparity is even worse in some counties.,2016-01-27,"Demonstrators march to protest police abuse in Miami, whose police department is one of those criticized in the ACLU report.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a904531f00005000216c5d.jpeg?ops=crop_0_187_4651_2995%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Black people in Florida are being stopped and ticketed for minor seat belt violations nearly twice as often as white people statewide and up to four times as often in specific counties, according to a report released Wednesday by the American Civil Liberties Union.While black people made up 13.5 percent of Florida resident drivers in 2014, they received nearly 22 percent of seat belt citations reported to state authorities. The ACLU analysis, titled ""Racial Disparities in Florida Safety Belt Law Enforcement,"" found that differences in seat-belt-wearing behavior didn't adequately explain the racial disparities, as black drivers were only slightly less likely than white drivers to wear seat belts. A recent Florida Department of Transportation study had found that 91.5 percent of white drivers wore their seat belt, compared to 85.8 percent of black drivers. If black Floridians had been ticketed for seat belt violations in proportion to their representation among the state's drivers, the ACLU analysis found they would have received over 20,000 fewer citations in 2014.The racial gap in seat belt enforcement was even worse in some counties. Black people were stopped and cited four times more often than white motorists by the Escambia County Sheriff's Office in 2011 (the most recent year for which data were reported), three times more often by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office in 2014 and 2.8 times more often by the Orange County Sheriff's Office in 2014. The ACLU urged the Florida Attorney General's Office of Civil Rights to investigate.""It raises a red flag when seatbelt enforcement by specific agencies leads to racial disparities that exceed even the dramatic statewide gap. These agencies must take steps to address the disparities and promote fair and impartial policing,"" said Nusrat Choudhury, an attorney with the ACLU's Racial Justice Program and co-author of the report, in a statement.Since 2005, Florida law has required all police agencies to report the race and ethnicity of people ticketed for failure to wear a seat belt to the state Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. According to the ACLU report, the number of agencies actually reporting those data hit a nine-year low in 2014 -- when only 147 agencies complied.That widespread failure to comply with the Florida Safety Belt Law is one of the key findings of the ACLU analysis. ""We cannot have a law that requires the reporting of the race of ticket recipients and has no consequences for the agencies that fail to comply,"" said Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, in a statement. He pointed to the Miami and Tampa police as among those whose information is missing from the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles annual reports.Tampa Police Department data appear only in the state's 2005 report, according to the ACLU. In response to a public records request from the civil rights organization, however, Tampa police noted that they had issued 575 seat belt citations to black people and 549 to white people in 2014. Black people make up 23 percent of the city's population.The Miami Police Department failed to report data to the state in 2005, 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2014. In response to an ACLU public records request, the department said it has ""no record pertaining to annual reports on Seatbelt Violation Collection Data"" for several of those years.The ACLU report calls on the Florida Legislature to penalize police agencies that fail to comply with the data reporting requirement. It also recommends that police departments collect and analyze data for all traffic and pedestrian stops, offer anti-bias training to officers, and retrain officers whose ticketing practices suggest racial profiling.Also on HuffPost:"
6,WOMEN,Why This Woman Made A Feminist Comedy About Bulimia,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-skinny-jessie-kahnweiler_us_56a7a4a1e4b01a3ed123e7a1,"Jessie Kahnweiler's ""The Skinny"" gets honest about eating disorders -- and so much more.",2016-01-27,"Kahnweiler looking joyful as the protagonist of ""The Skinny.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a7e5062a00006e00031540.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You wouldn't necessarily expect ""bulimia"" and ""funny"" to be in the same sentence, let alone form the building blocks of a show. But that's exactly what filmmaker and actress Jessie Kahnweiler's new series, ""The Skinny"" does: find the comedy in a topic as seemingly dark as eating disorders. ""The Skinny,"" which premieres on Refinery29 on January 27, follows a young feminist YouTuber named Jessie -- ""I do hardcore feminist shit. Like, full bush, liberal"" -- who lives in LA. She also happens to have an eating disorder, something that informs all of her relationships, most importantly her relationship with herself. The series, though very much a work of fiction, is deeply rooted in Kahnweiler's own experiences. She was bulimic for over a decade and is now in recovery, a process she sees as ongoing, possibly forever.I spoke to Kahnweiler just after the Sundance premiere of her show this week. She was getting on a bus ""drunk on love,"" and chatted with me about the perceived tension between being a ""good"" feminist and having eating issues, the need to tell your own story authentically, and why ""The Skinny"" is about so much more than bulimia.I know ""The Skinny"" is somewhat inspired by your own struggles with an eating disorder. What made you want to create a show that touches on those themes with yourself at the center?As an independent filmmaker it’s just, what are the stories that are not being told? What’s the shit that matters to me and my friends that’s not being depicted in an honest way, whether that’s sexual assault or race or eating disorders? I was bulimic for over 10 years and in recovery now. And I believe that I’m never going to be recovered, it’s always going to be something that’s a part of me. [I wanted to explore] this issue of women’s relationships to their bodies and how that relates to sexuality and food and desire. I was literally searching for a story like that.Was it scary to create something so personal?I was really nervous. Part of me felt like, this is the most shameful thing. I can flash my tits, I can say ""fuck,"" I can be that zany clown, but what I was doing with my eating was so shameful that that was the scariest thing to expose. That’s what made me want to do it -- this challenge and the need to see this story told in an authentic way, which is very personal to me but not just my story.Do you think what you’re doing with ""The Skinny"" is different from the depictions of eating disorders on TV and in movies we usually see?I don’t know if it’s different, but as an out and proud TV addict I was looking for stories that showed eating disorders in a real way. It’s joked around with because people feel really uncomfortable or it’s melodramatic -- like this girl has an eating disorder, and then by Act III three she almost dies and then she’s better. And for me that was not my experience. I was this loud, happy, crazy, feminist and I also had this other part of me that was full of shame and self-hate. So, how do those two people co-exist in the same woman? 'Cause every woman I know is incredibly complicated. So I was really interested in exploring that. I guess [through the show] I'm asking questions to myself. How did this happen? What does this mean? I feel very grateful going through this process of recovery. The show is probably part of that, though it is not actual therapy.What a novel idea! Women are complicated![Laughs] I know, you would think. We have 'Girls,' let’s move on. For some reason -- we show sex and violence and all this crazy stuff on TV and that’s OK, but you show a woman eating an entire pizza and that’s insane. And that’s insane to me, because that perpetuates the cycle of shame. If you don’t see your story, you’re like, 'Well, I’m the only one.' That’s what I thought for 10 years: 'I’m the only one that does this, no one else does this shit with food like I do, and I need to keep it to myself and I need to get better by myself.' Which is total bullshit. You’ve also spoken about the tension you felt between being a ""strong feminist"" and having an eating disorder. What is it about food issues -- which pretty much every woman struggles with -- that is seen as being incongruous with our feminist values?That’s a great question. I really believe that it has everything to do with a lack of female storytellers and the female gaze being represented, which means women telling stories about their own lives and putting themselves as protagonists in their own stories. It’s amazing to have Lena and ""Broad City"" and Amy Schumer, but if you think about all the TV shows out there, 95 percent [of the time] we’re still seeing a man’s experience. Of course men can write women and women can write men, but I think that when it comes to something like eating and body, I think there just needs to be more. Yes, there’s women. Yes, they’re making art. And, yes, there needs to be a lot fucking more. Most of your work has been online. How do you think the Internet has changed your career trajectory?I wouldn’t have been able to be an artist before the Internet. No one wanted to make this show. Nobody. Eating disorders are ugly or messy or gross. So, what are we going to do about it? There was something inside of me as an artist that was like, 'I will literally die before I don’t tell this story.' It was bursting out of me. So going on Kickstarter and literally empowering myself, and enlisting Illeana Douglas [who plays Jessie's mom in 'The Skinny'], you get all these little pebbles of hope. You get Illeana Douglas saying yes. You get 10 bucks and an email from a girl saying, 'Oh man I thought I was the only one. Thank you so much for making this show.' OK, that’s a pebble of hope. And you keep rolling that pebble up the hill until it becomes a boulder. And now I’m at Sundance and 'The Skinny' is everyone’s -- it’s not mine anymore.You've worked with some incredible women, like ""Transparent"" creator Jill Soloway who is a producer on ""The Skinny."" How did your collaboration with her come about?I stalked Jill a few years ago on Facebook. I was really seeking out mentors. And Jill was a really badass storyteller, a really specific true voice. I sought her out and started this relationship where she helped me get this grant from the Jewish Federation and I was able to make a web series. Her thing is just to keep making work. I think a lot of the times in Hollywood it’s like, 'Well, it’s all about people you know.' And, yeah, it’s all about people you know, but you have to make the work. The work is the networking, ultimately. What was really incredible about having Jill involved in the show is that the show is so personal to me, and she really helped me build the structure. Everything is based off emotional truth, and having an adventure and characters learning, growing, changing and fucking up, and because I had her to help me shape the story, it allowed me to take more chances.A lot has been made about the show’s focus on our fucked up relationships with food. But when I was watching, a lot of other themes jumped out at me -- like the challenges of getting a creative career off the ground, the challenges of navigating relationships and dating, and maintaining boundaries with your parents as you grow up. Yes. I’m so happy you’re saying that. In structuring the show, it wasn’t the 'bulimia show.' It’s not just, this is what it’s like to be bulimic. Of course that’s really important, but I wanted it to be more of a story. It's about, having an eating disorder, how does it affect my relationships, my relationship to myself, my body. A lot of times, my eating disorder was my best friend and my worst enemy. Really [the show is] about this girl’s journey of becoming a woman and how she reconciles her self-hate. And how she makes meaning of her life. And, hopefully, that’s a universal story. There’s a moment in the third episode where your character is trying to sell her YouTube series and someone says, ""No one likes women that real."" That line really really stuck with me. Is that something you’ve actually heard said explicitly -- or is it just kind of implied?A lot of the show is inspired from these nuggets that happened and then you build on them. That moment specifically, as a woman I feel like either I’m not enough or I feel like I’m too much. And I’m totally internalizing the patriarchy in moments where I’m like, 'Oh my god, I don’t want to take up too much space.' I’ve been told I’m too much my whole life. And I think I was trying to face that and examine that. And there’s no bad guy. I’m not saying that the guy who said that to me is the bad guy. But just, god, where did this [attitude] come from? How can we change it? How does the way society deals with women affect my own relationship with my body? As I’m growing and feeling more comfortable in my body, how does that change how I am as an artist, as a friend, as a girlfriend, as someone who loves the environment and politics? I feel like the most fundamental relationship is my relationship with my body, yet it’s been a journey to get back there -- to the state of being a little kid, where my body was something I used to have fun and not take out all my rage on. Ultimately, what do you hope other women take away from watching ""The Skinny""?I really hope that it’s an entertaining experience. I know that it can make people kind of feel uncomfortable but I really want it to feel like, it’s OK. The most shameful thing about you, I’ve felt too. That thought? I’ve had it too. The process of making the show, and working with my writers and my editor and Jill, it was a constant process of, 'Me too. Me too.' Women [need] to tell the stories that only they can tell.Watch a trailer for ""The Skinny"" below:Need help?

Under the harsh glare of public scrutiny, the now Super Bowl-bound squad had to play together on the field, week in and week out, in order to disprove the haters -- using that external negativity as its motivation to perform every time it stepped under the bright lights of a given stadium.Ask anyone in the franchise, and they’ll say it was a collective effort. Cliché as the line may sound, owner Jerry Richardson backed up the sentiment this week when the team announced that Richardson will foot the bill for every single member of the organization to attend Super Bowl 50 on Feb. 7. “Mr. Richardson understands that this memorable season would not have been possible without harmony and a complete team effort,” Panthers president Danny Morrison told the Charlotte Observer on Tuesday. “This is not unprecedented as he also provided an opportunity for the Panthers staff to travel to the 2004 Super Bowl in Houston, Texas. It’s an incredibly gracious gift.”This commendable gesture on the part of Richardson is part of a long line of nice deeds done by Carolina this year. Along with the team giving touchdown balls to young fans every home game, quarterback Cam Newton has spent much time working with members of the community, supporting the people of Charlotte through regular acts of community service just as the people of Charlotte support him on the gridiron every down of every game.Also on HuffPost:"
10,POLITICS,Evangelical Voters Don't Care That Trump's Not Religious,Natalie Jackson and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/evangelical-voters-trump_us_56a8ebd9e4b0947efb661ebc,The real estate mogul just picked up an endorsement from a major evangelical leader.,2016-01-27,"Compared with Carson, Cruz and Rubio, fewer GOP voters see Trump as a religious person",http://www.pewforum.org/files/2016/01/PF_16.01.26_ReligionPolitics_trumpReligious420px.png,"Businessman Donald Trump is viewed as the least religious of all the GOP presidential candidates, according to a new report from Pew Research -- but evangelical voters don't really care.Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed Trump on Tuesday, saying the real estate mogul is the best chance to “lead our country to greatness again.” How did a candidate whom only 30 percent of Americans view as very or somewhat religious get such a critical endorsement from the evangelical leader? It seems that when it comes to Trump, religion matters less than it does with other candidates.Among Republicans, only 5 percent say they think Trump is very religious, and an additional 39 percent say he’s somewhat religious. Forty-seven percent say he’s not too religious or not at all religious. By comparison, 70 percent of Republicans think Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is very or somewhat religious, which increases to 76 percent for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and 80 percent for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Despite his low marks on religiosity, 56 percent of Republicans say that Trump would make a good or great president. That proportion rises to 59 percent among white evangelical Protestant Republican voters. Carson and Cruz get slightly higher marks, with 62 percent and 63 percent respectively, but those numbers aren’t significantly higher than Trump’s.Even if evangelical primary voters don't see Trump as religious, he's worked hard to get into their good graces, casting himself as a defender of Christianity against malign forces. ""Christianity, it's under siege,"" he recently told a crowd composed mostly of students from Liberty University, the evangelical college where Cruz announced his bid for the presidency last year.That may appeal to voters who feel increasingly disenfranchised. “Trump is painting a bigger picture -- a kind of appeal to nostalgia and to a mythical golden age that he wants to bring back in America that is very appealing to evangelicals,"" Robert Jones, the CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, told Washington Post blogger Greg Sargent last month. ""Evangelicals strongly believe American culture has changed for the worse."" There are some signs that Trump's strategy is working. CBS and YouGov's most recent poll of the Iowa primary finds Trump gaining modestly among evangelical voters, partially at Cruz's expense, although he still lags behind. NBC and SurveyMonkey found a similar shift among white evangelicals nationally.""A lot of people come to Iowa and try to be evangelical. Voters can see through that. Donald Trump doesn't care about being anything but himself. ... Evangelicals haven't coalesced behind any one candidate, and Trump has capitalized on this,"" David Andersen, a political science professor at Iowa State University, told Bloomberg News. "

Holder, a 2013 case in which the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the landmark civil rights law. ""Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically,"" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in the court's 5-4 majority opinion, which effectively gutted the law's requirement that certain jurisdictions with a history of discrimination must seek ""pre-clearance"" from the federal government before enacting new election rules.Based on that win, Shelby County tried to convince lower courts that it was entitled to be awarded attorney fees. Under federal law, winners in civil rights litigation may be reimbursed for this major cost after the case is over. The idea is to encourage lawyers to help those who seek protection of their civil rights in court.But in September, a federal appeals court turned down the county's request, ruling that it ""defies common sense and ignores the structure and history"" of the Voting Rights Act to argue that Congress wanted to encourage states and other localities to challenge its constitutionality in court. As with other civil rights statutes, the court said, the ""central purpose"" of the Voting Rights Act provision on attorney fees was ""vindicating the national policy against wrongful discrimination by encouraging victims to make the wrongdoers pay at law.""With Monday's rejection, the Supreme Court left that ruling in place. At least implicitly, the justices seemed to agree that Shelby County shouldn't get paid for working to demolish an important pillar of the civil rights movement."

Called The Love Fellowship, the project stems from the story of Claudetteia Love, a Louisiana queer teen whose school tried to ban her from wearing a tux to prom. In response to the school, which eventually let Love attend the prom in the outfit of her choosing, Sharpe Suiting and NiK Kacy designed a custom tux and footwear for the queer teen. They even offered to throw an alternative prom, if needed. Now, the two designers want to extend that opportunity to other queer teens.""Luckily, after an inordinate amount of press, and pressure from Love’s family and the school board, the principal backed down and Love was allowed to wear whatever formal attire she chose,"" Sharpe Suiting designer Leon Wu told The Huffington Post. ""Hand delivering that custom Sharpe burgundy tux and matching shoes provided by NiK Kacy to Love’s house and seeing her face when she tried her prom outfit on for the first time was one of the highlights of my career so far, and it reminded me, yet again, of why I founded Sharpe in the first place.""Here is how the competition will work: Interested high school students who identify as queer have until Feb. 15, to submit a video through The Love Fellowship website that explains why freedom of gender expression as an individual is important to them. The two designers will then pick one winner to receive a custom prom outfit and will share several of their other favorite entries on their social media channels, as well.The pair of designers hope to make The Love Fellowship an annual project to help queer teens to express themselves fully at what many people consider one of the landmark moments of a traditional high school experience.""High school is a time in a person’s life when they start exploring who they are going to be and how they are going to express themselves,"" Wu continued. ""How are they seen in the world? Will the world accept them for who they are?... Forcing youth to conform to rigid male-female gender expressions that don’t accurately reflect their identities nullifies this celebration. It sends a clear message that those students who don’t fit cleanly into arbitrary boxes are not worth celebrating, nor should even be included, which can cause a lasting impression throughout the rest of their lives. We should be striving to nurture individuality and creativity, and understand that each expression of self is valid.""Interested in entering the competition?

In studies of the current outbreak in Brazil, genetic material from the Zika virus has been identified in studies of brain tissue, placenta and amniotic fluid from several infants with microcephaly and from miscarried fetuses from women infected with the virus.Although Zika transmission has not yet been reported in the United States, mosquitoes that carry the infection are endemic to specific regions of the United States, and experts believe transmission is likely in the coming months as the weather heats up.In the interim guidelines for pediatricians, the CDC recommends that infants with microcephaly born to women exposed to Zika while pregnant should be tested for the virus. For infants without microcephaly but whose mothers received a positive or inconclusive test for the virus, the guidelines call for the child to be tested for possible Zika infection.The guidance also informs U.S. doctors that Zika is a nationally notifiable condition, meaning that suspected cases must be reported to state and territorial health departments.No treatments or vaccines are available for Zika infections.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by James Dalgleish)Also on HuffPost: "

The proposed event, which is to be moderated by ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, threatens the Democratic National Committee’s power over the debate schedule.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's campaign indicated Tuesday that its candidate would participate.""Today is a big victory not only for our campaign and our supporters that championed this effort, but it is also a victory for voters across New Hampshire and the United States,"" John Bivona, O'Malley's New Hampshire state director, said in a statement. O'Malley, whose poll numbers remain in the single digits, would presumably gain the most from a nationally televised debate. “Hillary Clinton would be happy to participate in a debate in New Hampshire if the other candidates agree, which would allow the DNC to sanction the debate,” Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement. A Sanders spokesman did not comment specifically on the proposed Feb. 4 debate, but said in an email the campaign ""will be working with the DNC and the other campaigns to schedule additional debates.""In a statement, DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) said the committee has “no plans to sanction any further debates before the upcoming First in the Nation caucuses and primary, but will reconvene with our campaigns after those two contests to review our schedule.”The DNC scheduled six debates this election cycle, with just four taking place before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries -- and three of those occurring on weekends. The most recent debate was held Jan. 17, with another not slated until after New Hampshire voters go to the polls on Feb. 9. BuzzFeed first reported news of the upcoming debate, and the Union Leader confirmed its plans in an article on its site. In the article, Union Leader president and publisher Joseph W. McQuaid said this cycle would have been the ""first time in 32 years without a Democratic debate before the New Hampshire primary.”McQuaid told The Huffington Post that he ""can’t imagine that the Democratic candidates, post-Iowa, would want to be seen as breaking with a New Hampshire tradition.""Union Leader Executive Editor Trent Spiner said in a separate email that there ""has been a true groundswell for another debate in New Hampshire.""""It’s not just readers and local politicos,"" Spiner wrote. ""I’ve been stopped at the grocery store by undecided voters who say they’re just starting to pay attention now. We feel it is our duty to provide Granite Staters with the information they need before they head to the polls.""The DNC, like its counterparts at the Republican National Committee, took a firmer hand this cycle over the debate process and threatened to exclude candidates who take part in so-called “unsanctioned” debates from participating in those officially scheduled -- two of which still remain. Candidates are permitted to participate in forums or town halls, like CNN’s Monday night, in which they don’t engage with one another onstage. Wasserman Schultz has long defended the party's debate schedule, which has faced criticism from the Sanders and O'Malley campaigns, as well as from leaders such as vice chair and Hawaii Congressman Tulsi Gabbard.Many have viewed the DNC's debate schedule as structured to benefit Clinton by offering few opportunities for rivals to gain national exposure and, perhaps, momentum against the party's front-runner. However, some Clinton advisers have recently expressed regret that there weren't more debates scheduled as Sanders presents a serious challenge to Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire. This article has been updated with comments from Clinton, Sanders and Wasserman Schultz.Also on HuffPost:"

But one branch of the federal government did show up for work: The U.S. Supreme Court.The justices actually had a pretty busy day, issuing six decisions, several orders in pending cases and dozens of rejections -- including one that could have been a mini-sequel to the court's Shelby County v. Holder decision, the infamous 2013 ruling that gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965.Perhaps the greatest thing the Supreme Court did on Monday was rule that juvenile offenders sentenced to die in prison without an opportunity for parole may be granted the chance to see the light of day. The decision expands a 2012 ruling that said those sentences are cruel and unusual under the Constitution. The court also ruled in favor of the Obama administration in a big energy case, didn't let North Dakota enforce a restrictive abortion law, clarified what to do when some jury instructions go beyond what criminal law requires, and settled a contractual dispute between an Indian tribe and the federal government, among other activity.To be sure, the bench was a little lighter on Monday, with only five of the nine justices making it to a public hearing to announce some of the decisions: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan.Mark Walsh, a veteran Supreme Court reporter who was also one of two journalists at the hearing, said general attendance was also sparse: Only two members of the public were present, plus court staff, other officers and a few guests.Still, that didn't keep the court from going about its business.""I see we have a big audience for the FERC case,"" Kagan said, referring to the energy case she decided for a 6-2 court. (Justice Samuel Alito recused himself from the case due to a financial conflict; presumably, that's why he wasn't there.)Other decision announcements followed, including one in which Roberts had to stand in for Justice Antonin Scalia, who apparently didn't make it to work because he has an engagement in Singapore scheduled for Thursday.Because the Supreme Court only released opinions but didn't formally hear arguments in any pending case on Monday, it won't release audio of these sessions until sometime in the fall.But Walsh, who was there for SCOTUSblog, managed to catch this bit:""I would be remiss if I did not thank the court's employees for their dedicated efforts over the past few days and this morning, which allowed the court to hold our scheduled sitting today,"" Roberts said at the close of the session.Maybe Roberts was following in the footsteps of his predecessor, the late William Rehnquist, who 20 years ago defied nearly two feet of snow to keep the court open after a major blizzard.Or maybe he just wanted to prove that the least dangerous branch of the federal government is truly independent from the others.Also on HuffPost:"

The nurse told ABC News that because of the storm, she knew most people wouldn't be able to make it to work. With her 3-year-old daughter safe with a babysitter, she decided to make the trek to Hebrew Home. “As long as my daughter was safe [with a baby-sitter], I knew I had to come back and take care of my second family.

But a new fruit-picking robotic system uses complex signal processing to pick and sort irregular shaped fruits without damaging them.Built by development firm Cambridge Consultants, the robot could boost productivity across the food chain by sorting fruit and vegetables or, for example, identifying and removing weeds among crops in a field.Using low-cost and easily available hardware, such as Microsoft's Kinect sensor, the scientists designed intuitive algorithms to give the robotic system a cognitive ability to work out how to best handle items that vary from shape to shape.""Traditional robotic systems typically pick up exactly the same object from exactly the same place and move it to somewhere new; always doing the same action over and over again. But there are places, there are applications where robotics aren't used at the moment where they could be if you can build in this capability of dealing with natural variations and small changes in the environment into the robotic system itself,"" explained Chris Roberts, head of industrial robotics at Cambridge Consultants.In order to be a useful tool for fruit and vegetable growers, the robot needs to recognize the correct objects and calculate the order in which to pick them. It also needs to plan which grip to use, and the lifting and placing of each item. The system is capable of handling objects for which no detailed computer-aided design (CAD) model exists, says Roberts.Fundamental to the viability of the system is the design of the gripper which has to adapt to the shape of the fruit and securely grip it without damaging it.""The gripper has got a sensor inside it so it can sense the pressure of the vacuum tubes as they close around the fruit. And by only applying a vacuum to the ones that gripped, the ones where there's a seal, we can spread the pressure across the fruit so we're not bruising it but we still apply a consistent pressure that allows us to pick up heavier objects,"" said Roberts.To demonstrate the system in a laboratory setting, a selection of randomly stacked fruit was sorted into separate bowls. The machine's software identifies which piece of fruit is closest to the top and translates this information into co-ordinates and positions the 'hand' to pick the required fruit, whilst avoiding other objects. The system's algorithms take into account not only size and shape, but also color. This means, for example, that red apples can be separated from green apples.Roberts says that the fruit-picking robot demonstrates an intelligent system that combines programing, electronics and mechanical engineering. But he believes similar 'smart' robots could transform a variety of industrial and commercial processes.""Another area where this is applicable is when robots come to interact with people, people aren't as predictable as a production line.

But a new fruit-picking robotic system uses complex signal processing to pick and sort irregular shaped fruits without damaging them.Built by development firm Cambridge Consultants, the robot could boost productivity across the food chain by sorting fruit and vegetables or, for example, identifying and removing weeds among crops in a field.Using low-cost and easily available hardware, such as Microsoft's Kinect sensor, the scientists designed intuitive algorithms to give the robotic system a cognitive ability to work out how to best handle items that vary from shape to shape.""Traditional robotic systems typically pick up exactly the same object from exactly the same place and move it to somewhere new; always doing the same action over and over again. But there are places, there are applications where robotics aren't used at the moment where they could be if you can build in this capability of dealing with natural variations and small changes in the environment into the robotic system itself,"" explained Chris Roberts, head of industrial robotics at Cambridge Consultants.In order to be a useful tool for fruit and vegetable growers, the robot needs to recognize the correct objects and calculate the order in which to pick them. It also needs to plan which grip to use, and the lifting and placing of each item. The system is capable of handling objects for which no detailed computer-aided design (CAD) model exists, says Roberts.Fundamental to the viability of the system is the design of the gripper which has to adapt to the shape of the fruit and securely grip it without damaging it.""The gripper has got a sensor inside it so it can sense the pressure of the vacuum tubes as they close around the fruit. And by only applying a vacuum to the ones that gripped, the ones where there's a seal, we can spread the pressure across the fruit so we're not bruising it but we still apply a consistent pressure that allows us to pick up heavier objects,"" said Roberts.To demonstrate the system in a laboratory setting, a selection of randomly stacked fruit was sorted into separate bowls. The machine's software identifies which piece of fruit is closest to the top and translates this information into co-ordinates and positions the 'hand' to pick the required fruit, whilst avoiding other objects. The system's algorithms take into account not only size and shape, but also color. This means, for example, that red apples can be separated from green apples.Roberts says that the fruit-picking robot demonstrates an intelligent system that combines programing, electronics and mechanical engineering. But he believes similar 'smart' robots could transform a variety of industrial and commercial processes.""Another area where this is applicable is when robots come to interact with people, people aren't as predictable as a production line. So the robot needs to be able to deal with changes in the environment and if someone moves an object from one place to another the robot needs to cope with that,"" said Roberts.Also on HuffPost:"

It turned out that three manuscripts were hidden in the archive of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum.Only one illustration by Potter appears to exist. Other letters indicate that she meant to finish the work, but was distracted various life events, according to the BBC. The version to be published in September will include illustrations by Quentin Blake, known for his work illustrating the books of Roald Dahl.What really sells this one is the promise of a tubby Peter Rabbit.”It has double identities, colorful villains and a number of favorite characters from other tales -- most excitingly, Peter Rabbit makes an appearance, albeit older, slower and portlier,” Hanks told The Bookseller."

The report, co-authored with the Education Commission of the States, lays out some of the challenges with allowing firearms at universities. It examines a steady ""momentum"" of conservative lawmakers' efforts in state legislatures to require colleges to allow firearms on their premises. The vast majority of higher education administrators and campus law enforcement oppose these efforts. The good news for those opponents is that most of the bills to expand guns on campus died in 2015, the report notes.Still, Andrew Morse, director for policy research and advocacy with NASPA, said the last thing higher ed leaders should do is relax and assume future legislation won't go anywhere, given the ramifications of implementing these laws.Many proponents of allowing concealed carry on campuses say it's a matter of allowing law abiding citizens -- many of whom have passed requirements to get their permits -- to protect themselves on campuses. The bills typically say only those with proper permits could bring firearms on campuses. But NASPA cites a 2012 Government Accountability Office report that showed the requirements of states to get concealed carry permits vary widely -- and many don't require basic training in the safety and proper use of firearms.""Even the most stringent eligibility requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit do not prepare individuals to respond effectively in an active shooter situation,"" Morse told The Huffington Post. Regardless of the momentum of pending legislation, Morse added, it's important for higher education leaders to communicate ""the risk that an increased presence of concealed carry weapons may pose to the safety and well-being of their campus communities."" Aside from the difficulty police would face distinguishing a perpetrator from other armed, innocent bystanders in the event of a shooting on campus, NASPA's report warns simply allowing guns to be present could be problematic: Social scientists have widely published on the “weapons effect,” which shows that the mere presence of a weapon actually increases feelings of anger in both aggressive and non-aggressive individuals (Berkowitz & LePage, 1967; Turner, Layton, & Simons, 1975; Hemenway, Vriniotis, & Miller, 2006; Blanchette, 2006; Carlson, Fee, & Reinke, 2009; Fox, Griggs, & Mouchlianitis, 2007). By enacting concealed carry laws that pertain to college and university campuses, lawmakers should be mindful of the potential for new incidents of violence that such a change might bring to campuses.Morse suggested that college leaders should work to educate lawmakers about other measures they're taking on campus safety, like threat assessment, behavioral intervention teams and crisis response protocols, so that state officials don't assume schools are sitting on their hands.Separately, a policy brief that the American Association of State Colleges and Universities released this week says guns on campus are likely to be among the top legislative trends for higher education in 2016. ______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter covering higher education, and is based in New York.
