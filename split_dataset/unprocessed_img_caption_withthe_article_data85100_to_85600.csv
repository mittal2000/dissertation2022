1,POLITICS,Supreme Court Rejects Obama's Drive To Cut Mercury Emissions From Power Plants,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-mercury-rule_n_7640722.html,,2015-06-29,"NEW EAGLE, PA - SEPTEMBER 24: A plume of exhaust extends from the Mitchell Power Station, a coal-fired power plant located 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, on September 24, 2013 in New Eagle, Pennsylvania. The plant, owned by FirstEnergy, will be one of two plants in the region to be shut down, affecting 380 employees. The Evironmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama administration have been taking major steps to get coal-fired power plants into compliance with clean air regulations. (Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb901792600002d0183c6f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday ruled against an Environmental Protection Agency regulation limiting mercury and other toxic emissions from power plants, undermining the Obama administration's drive to cut pollution from electricity generators.The case looked at the EPA's regulation of mercury and other emissions from power plants under the Clean Air Act, which Republicans have attacked as a ""war on coal"" and an example of presidential overreach. The EPA interpreted the law ""unreasonably"" when it failed to consider the costs of compliance with the new regulations, the court ruled 5-4 in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia.""EPA strayed well beyond the bounds of reasonable interpretation in concluding that cost is not a factor relevant to the appropriateness of regulating power plants,"" concluded the majority. Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, wrote a scathing dissent that argues that the EPA did consider the costs of complying with the regulations -- just not at the initial stage of determining whether or not to regulate mercury emissions in the first place.   ""Over more than a decade, EPA took costs into account at multiple stages and through multiple means as it set emissions limits for power plants,"" wrote Kagan. ""And when making its initial 'appropriate and necessary' finding, EPA knew it would do exactly that -- knew it would thoroughly consider the cost-effectiveness of emissions standards later on.""  The majority's interpretation, Kagan argued, is ""a peculiarly blinkered way for a court to assess the lawfulness of an agency’s rulemaking.""  ""The Agency acted well within its authority in declining to consider costs at the opening bell of the regulatory process given that it would do so in every round thereafter -- and given that the emissions limits finally issued would depend crucially on those accountings,"" wrote Kagan.The EPA finalized rules limiting the release of mercury, heavy metals and acid gases from power plants in December 2011. While many newer power plants have technology to curb those hazardous releases, the rules target plants that still do not capture those emissions. The rules affect about 600 U.S. power plants, the majority of which are fueled by coal. Industry groups and 23 states challenged the rule, arguing that the EPA failed to take into account the cost of compliance, which they put at $9.6 billion. The EPA argued that the health benefits from cutting emissions would be at least triple the compliance costs.""We are reviewing the decision and will determine any appropriate next steps once our review is complete,"" said EPA spokeswoman Melissa Harrison on Monday. ""EPA is disappointed that the Court did not uphold the rule, but this rule was issued more than three years ago, investments have been made and most plants are already well on their way to compliance.""The question before the court hinged on the interpretation of a line in the Clean Air Act stating that the EPA ""shall regulate"" emissions from electric utilities if the agency finds that ""such regulation is appropriate and necessary."" The court assessed whether the EPA's interpretation of the word ""appropriate"" had to include the costs of compliance. ""It is not rational, never mind 'appropriate,' to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits,"" wrote Scalia in the majority opinion.Environmental groups criticized the ruling, and argued that the EPA should be able to tweak the mercury rule to comply with the court's decision. ""The Court has sided with the Dirty Delinquents -- the small percentage of coal-fired plants that haven't cleaned up -- and against the majority that are already protecting our children from mercury and other toxic pollutants,"" said Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp in a statement. ""It's critically important for our nation that these life-saving protections remain in place while EPA responds to the Court's decision, and EDF will focus its efforts on ensuring these safeguards are intact.""  The mercury rule is one of several major regulations from President Barack Obama's EPA limiting emissions from power plants, specifically units that are coal-powered. The agency is finishing rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions from both new and existing power plants as well, with the final rules expected within weeks. A federal appeals court upheld the regulations in 2014. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in March.Read the full decision here: Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency"
2,GOOD NEWS,7 Things You Should Not Apologize For,"Kimanzi Constable, ContributorFormer bread guy turned bestselling author. Join me at Kimanzi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-things-you-should-not-apologize-for_b_7633054.html,"From an early age, we're taught to color between the lines. We're taught that conformity is ""normal"" and that we shouldn't ruffle any feathers.",2015-06-29,2015-06-22-1434931488-3701773-5931171740_14fea8385d_z.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-22-1434931488-3701773-5931171740_14fea8385d_z-thumb.jpg,"From an early age, we're taught to color between the lines. We're taught that conformity is ""normal"" and that we shouldn't ruffle any feathers. As we grow older, we realize life has so much more to offer. We feel guilty about wanting MORE.We dip our toe in the water (so to speak) and retreat when we experience any resistance. When we get bolder and experience a little success, we apologize for taking what we want. What we were taught comes back to our mind, and we apologize for trying to be different. Life is short. Too short to apologize for claiming the life we truly want to live. Here are seven reasons why we should not apologize for refusing to conform. 1. Chasing your dreams. I think we can all agree that the ""American Dream"" lifestyle is broken. Wages are lower, and the cost of everything is increasing. The days of going to a job for 40 years and getting a pension are over. More than that, who wants to spend 40 plus hours each week doing something we hate? Chase your dreams and don't apologize for wanting more from your ""work."" 2. Valuing your health. There is nothing wrong if someone chooses to drink, smoke, or eat fast food. If you decide that's NOT what you want in your life and for your health, don't apologize. Your body is a temple, and you choose what goes in. If you choose to say NO even though it's socially acceptable, don't feel like an outsider. 3. Ending toxic relationships. Whether it's a friendship, family members or romantic involvements, toxic relationships can ruin your life. As hard as it is, purge relationships from your life that aren't in line with the kind of life you want to live. 4. Avoiding complacency. Too often in life, we confuse being grateful with being complacent. You can be grateful for the life you have, yet want to do bigger and greater things. Being comfortable is the enemy of progress because it convinces you to settle. 5. Never looking back. If you have left behind an old way of living or negative people, don't apologize or look back. Keep moving forward. Keep chasing bigger and higher dreams. Never settle. 6. Being confident in what you want.A lot of times confidence is confused with arrogance. Face it; there are some of us who know what we want and go after those things. Don't apologize for your certainty and persistence in accomplishing big goals and dreams. Let confidence be your guide through the times when doubt and fear try to derail you. 7. Saying No. We are people pleasers by nature and it's hard to say NO. We want people to like us and in our minds saying YES helps. More times than not, saying NO frees us up to say YES to the things that help our life and dreams. Never apologize for saying No to something that doesn't benefit your goals and dreams.Even though apologizing is in our nature, we can break the habit and live free. ""Success"" will have a different meaning for anyone reading this, but I think a good universal definition is freedom. We long to live life on our terms and spend our time doing what's important to us. Chase that kind of life and don't apologize. ---Photo credit: Flickr/ Salvatore Iovene"
3,BLACK VOICES,When Microaggressions Become Macro Confessions,"Yohuru Williams, ContributorHistorian, professor, education activist and author of Teachin...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-microaggressions-become-macroconfessions_b_7665302.html,"In the fuzzy arithmetic of their moral equivocation, flag pins matter, firearms matter, border patrols matter, but black and brown lives don't matter unless they can be leveraged for some self-serving political purpose",2015-06-29,"FILE - In this June 5, 2008 file photo, then-Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama D-Ill., wears an American flag pin as he speaks at a town hall-style meeting at Virginia High School in Bristol, Va. The president's re-election campaign is increasingly sounding like a nostalgia tour. His speeches stroll through elections past, serving up fond memories of his days running as a political unknown, identifying early political inspirations and reminding voters that, win or lose, this will be his last campaign after 13 appearances on the ballot since 1996. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0e7b200000e800ff3224.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Somewhere between the tragedy of the Charleston shooting and the comedy of the faux conservative horror over President Obama's use of the n-word is a profound statement on the power of white privilege in 21st century America. It is not good old-fashioned racism, although there is plenty of that to go around. The fact that the Confederate flag still flies proudly over the South Carolina State House is as much a commentary on the denial of black voting rights as it is on the reverence for the mythical Dixie of pre-Civil War America that stoked the racists fantasies of Dylann Roof and many others. Instead, it is a repackaged and slightly less robust form of racism that happily concedes more overt forms of prejudice and discrimination in exchange for the maintenance of white supremacy. Under the veneer of post-racialism, colorblindness and host of other terms legitimizing privilege, it is often marked by a hypersensitivity to issues of race meant to mask, but that often barely contain, significant hostility. News that South Carolina lawmakers might finally change the law to remove the flag is just the type of empty gesture that fuels such hostility. In 2007, conservative critics assailed then candidate Barack Obama for his decision not to wear an American flag pin. They sought to frame his choice as evidence of his presumed disloyalty and lack of patriotism. Even after Obama explained his position, the criticism persisted from those who lectured him on the importance of the flag as a symbol. If symbols on the lapel of the nation's chief executive matter as an affirmation of citizenship, they certainly mean as much in the privileged space over state houses in the South. That is where lawmakers are sworn in and from whence local police and officials derive their authority. It is the kind of microaggression that sociologists and other scholars warn maintains white privilege and damages the psyche of people of color -- especially African Americans who are intimately acquainted with the history of terror and oppression associated with the symbols of Confederate power. While I, too, would love to see the Confederate flag banished, I am wary of the debate ending with this symbolic gesture. Symbolic gestures, after all, rarely have anything more than symbolic consequences. What we need is real, systemic change. The removal of the flag will do little to conquer the persistent racial animus that continues to define and inform U.S. race relations without concrete programs to address the underlying fear and inequality that feed it. It will become yet another outward sign of ""progress"" devoid of any tangible action on the issues of race and poverty.This is exactly what some of the usually-hostile-to-race-issue voices now speaking favorably about removing the flag really want. Individuals like Senator Lindsey Graham who came under fire in 2014 after he remarked, ""If I get to be president, white men in male-only clubs are going to do great in my presidency."" The South Carolina Senator later claimed that his comments to the all white, all-male Hibernian Society of Charleston, South Carolina, were a joke, although it's hard to see the humor in light of the present tragedy. It explains why there has been little discussion of the connection of this tragedy on their part to the larger Black Lives Matter movement now taking place. In the fuzzy arithmetic of their moral equivocation, flag pins matter, firearms matter, border patrols matter, but black and brown lives don't matter unless they can be leveraged for some self-serving political purpose. Endless dialogue about urban crime, code for ""Black Crime,"" for instance, has been the rallying cry of the gun lobby for years. Now on the heels of the South Carolina shooting, NRA Board Member Charles L. Cotton had the audacity to blame the pastor for the carnage. ""Eight of Reverend Clementa Pinckney's Church Members who might be alive,"" he posted in the aftermath of the shooting, ""if he expressly allowed members to carry handguns in church are dead innocent people died because of his position on a political issue."" The idea that ""God fearing Christians"" bring armaments to a house of worship with a foundational doctrine against killing is on its own laughable, but part and parcel of the selective morality that characterizes the gun lobby. Presumably, they preferred officials wresting rifles instead of bibles from the cold dead hands of Roof's victims. In this way, microaggressions become macro confessions about who and what we truly are -- a bitterly divided republic unable to live up to its professed values and rallying around the wrong flag issue. As Americans, we should be deeply concerned about the lives of all citizens and prepared to work toward addressing those divisions that prevent us from making the most of our pluralism. Taking on the issue of gun violence in this country goes beyond the tired victim-blaming and race-baiting that passes for dialogue among some.We must ask deeper questions about the sale and manufacture of firearms as well as antiquated laws, less visible but no less insidious than the shadow of the Confederate flag, that place American lives in jeopardy. Trading the removal of the flag for a pistol in every pulpit, especially given the propensity for those weapons to be used unjustifiably against people of color, is not the conversation we should be having. Fortress America is a house divided; it cannot stand. Revitalizing public education, addressing issues of poverty and inequality and tackling the troublesome history and persistent problem of racism in this country are far more worth subjects upon which to ruminate. The Attorney General's Report on Ferguson is a great blueprint that could serve as the basis for similar reports for other communities around the country. It will also require a breaking down silos and a national dialogue not solely on race, but history and our collective failure to live up to the aspirational beliefs articulated by Thomas Jefferson in the of the Declaration of Independence. For as long as the symbols of the Confederacy stare accusingly at us from the fabric of southern flags and lawmakers refuse to truly address not only the issue of poverty but the easy access to fire arms and the shameful slaughter of all American citizens, regardless of color, in gun violence it remains evident that we don't really believe our founding principles: ""that all persons are created equal... endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights [of] life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."""

Sometimes we are stared at with curiosity, a white woman and a Chinese man. It's not uncommon in modern Los Angeles to see an interracial couple like us, but in the neighborhoods of Monterey Park, Hacienda Heights, Alhambra, Rowland Heights and Arcadia, most of the diners and waitstaff are just-off-the-plane Chinese immigrants, and yes, the waiter plunks down a fork in front of me. When I was first forked in a Chinese restaurant, it was almost midnight. We were both hungry after attending an outdoor summer concert. Our picnic dinner under the stars consisted of wine, crackers and cheese. With little food and several glasses of wine sloshing around inside me, I was in the mood for something more substantial. In search of late night Chinese eats, we stumbled upon a brightly lit diner called Sunday Bistro. A lanky waiter flung a menu at my fiancé and left us to peruse the extensive list of offerings. On his side of the table, chopsticks. On my side of the table, a busboy swiftly removed the chopsticks and replaced them with a fork. My eyes opened with surprise then rolled in amusement. I had just been forked. We looked over the menu selections such as deep fried frog, imitation abalone and bitter melon soup, X.O. sauce seafood fried rice along with the usual noodle offerings, seafood selections, bean curd dishes and Americanized versions of ""Chinese food"" like sweet and sour pork, orange chicken and chow mein. The oddest menu listings, by the way, were French Toast with peanut butter, Russian Borscht and Creole seafood gumbo which piqued my curiosity simply because they were so misplaced. Hong Kong style dishes led to eccentric French versions of escargot bourguignon, French onion soup and the random Spaghetti Bolognese among soft shell crab, baked green mussels and beef chow fun. Perhaps forks were paired with chopsticks given the mélange de cuisine? Our waiter returned with spicy swagger like chili mixing in a dish of soy sauce. My fiancé asked casually about the crocodile meat soup. The smug waiter curtly stated that crocodile was illegal and therefore not on the menu. ""But it's right here,"" my fiancé insisted in his Mandarin Changlish, pointing to the laminated menu describing ""crocodile meat in herbal soup"" for $6.95. The waiter shook his head and firmly insisted, ""It's not on the menu. Illegal."" Then he smirked, ""Why don't you try the kung pao chicken?"" It all seemed a joke to him. The fork in front of me. Kung pao chicken. Of course. A white woman with a Chinese-American man. Rather than suffer the kung pao chicken mentality of our waiter, I pushed my shiny fork aside and ordered some braised sea cucumber with black mushrooms and mustard greens. As my request seemed to disappoint his bravado, I really stuck my fork in and demanded a pair of chopsticks. For a just a moment I meditated upon this fork treatment and wondered if it was a gesture of hospitality that I misinterpreted as culinary racism.

6,TASTE,Getting Forked in San Gabriel,"Stephanie Kordan, ContributorLos Angeles-based writer, food blogger, adventurous vegetarian...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/getting-forked-in-san-gabriel_b_7666564.html,"When I was first forked in a Chinese restaurant, it was almost midnight.",2015-06-29,2015-06-27-1435378975-13976-Shanghai1SeafoodDiningRoom.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-27-1435378975-13976-Shanghai1SeafoodDiningRoom-thumb.jpg,"Chinatown began in the heart of Los Angeles' downtown, however, due to the city's cultural evolution, the hub of 'real Chinese cuisine' is East of the original historic Los Angeles within the ever expanding belt loop of the San Gabriel Valley. I've been inside the belly of this dumpling house dragon (""The 626"" or ""The SGV"" as we Angelenos call it) led by the chopsticks of my food critic fiancé, best known for his extreme eating adventures via his decade-seasoned blog Deep End Dining. Sometimes we are stared at with curiosity, a white woman and a Chinese man. It's not uncommon in modern Los Angeles to see an interracial couple like us, but in the neighborhoods of Monterey Park, Hacienda Heights, Alhambra, Rowland Heights and Arcadia, most of the diners and waitstaff are just-off-the-plane Chinese immigrants, and yes, the waiter plunks down a fork in front of me. When I was first forked in a Chinese restaurant, it was almost midnight. We were both hungry after attending an outdoor summer concert. Our picnic dinner under the stars consisted of wine, crackers and cheese. With little food and several glasses of wine sloshing around inside me, I was in the mood for something more substantial. In search of late night Chinese eats, we stumbled upon a brightly lit diner called Sunday Bistro. A lanky waiter flung a menu at my fiancé and left us to peruse the extensive list of offerings. On his side of the table, chopsticks. On my side of the table, a busboy swiftly removed the chopsticks and replaced them with a fork. My eyes opened with surprise then rolled in amusement. I had just been forked. We looked over the menu selections such as deep fried frog, imitation abalone and bitter melon soup, X.O. sauce seafood fried rice along with the usual noodle offerings, seafood selections, bean curd dishes and Americanized versions of ""Chinese food"" like sweet and sour pork, orange chicken and chow mein. The oddest menu listings, by the way, were French Toast with peanut butter, Russian Borscht and Creole seafood gumbo which piqued my curiosity simply because they were so misplaced. Hong Kong style dishes led to eccentric French versions of escargot bourguignon, French onion soup and the random Spaghetti Bolognese among soft shell crab, baked green mussels and beef chow fun. Perhaps forks were paired with chopsticks given the mélange de cuisine? Our waiter returned with spicy swagger like chili mixing in a dish of soy sauce. My fiancé asked casually about the crocodile meat soup. The smug waiter curtly stated that crocodile was illegal and therefore not on the menu. ""But it's right here,"" my fiancé insisted in his Mandarin Changlish, pointing to the laminated menu describing ""crocodile meat in herbal soup"" for $6.95. The waiter shook his head and firmly insisted, ""It's not on the menu. Illegal."" Then he smirked, ""Why don't you try the kung pao chicken?"" It all seemed a joke to him. The fork in front of me. Kung pao chicken. Of course. A white woman with a Chinese-American man. Rather than suffer the kung pao chicken mentality of our waiter, I pushed my shiny fork aside and ordered some braised sea cucumber with black mushrooms and mustard greens. As my request seemed to disappoint his bravado, I really stuck my fork in and demanded a pair of chopsticks. For a just a moment I meditated upon this fork treatment and wondered if it was a gesture of hospitality that I misinterpreted as culinary racism. Perhaps the fork was placed there for my convenience in case I was too embarrassed to ask for it. I can't argue this fork-versus-chopsticks treatment. It isn't always a problem for me, regardless of how dexterous I am with sticks. I can eat like a good Chinese daughter-in-law, managing rice, dumplings, slippery shrimp and jelly textures without fail. Reluctantly, a fork gives me identity.The Chinese have been wielding chopsticks since 1200 B.C, yet I've only been at it since 1982. My tastes for xiao long bao, black mushrooms, sea cucumber, noodles and rice aren't as challenging with a fork, yet I stake my claim with two chopsticks into the center of the San Gabriel Valley for my Chinese feasting. Want to sink your chopsticks into something delicious in the San Gabriel Valley? Here are a few places I recommend getting forked at:  China Red 855 S. Baldwin Ave, Arcadia. (626) 445-3700 Forks and chopsticks down, China Red is my most favorite place for dining on delectable dim sum delights. This is where I go all chopstick happy and rarely (if ever) get forked at the table (because they know me) but if they do give you the fork, you'll need it to handle their deluxe soup dumpling. Maybe.Lunasia Chinese Cuisine 500 W. Main St., A, Alhambra, (626) 308-3222 If my sweetheart and I make a dumpling date, Lunasia is our place to go. Among the chicken feet and juicy Shanghai style pork dumplings, linger over the luscious Lunasia dim sum specialties like pan fried turnip cake in X.O. sauce, sticky rice lotus leaf wraps and polish it all off with some deep fried almond crusted fish balls. You may not need your fork after all when those finger licking good egg tarts come to the table. (photo courtesy gogobot.com)Shanghai No. 1 Seafood 250 W. Valley Blvd., M, San Gabriel, (626) 282-1777  The oversized magazine of a menu features Shanghai-style cuisine. Its chic interior proves Shanghai No. 1 Seafood to be a treasure among the many Chinese eateries in the San Gabriel Valley. You will not be deceived by a fork when tasting sheng jian bao, xiao long bao and stir-fried green beans, but use your lips when kissing your shark lip abalone soup. For vegetarians I recommend the stir-fried bean vermicelli with garlic and carrot in a clay pot.  Mama's Lu Dumpling House 153 E Garvey Ave., Monterey Park, (626) 307-5700‎ You may get a fork here and there, but ah, who cares! Mama's Lu (or is it Mama Lu's?) Dumpling House is like eating at your Chinese grandma's kitchen table meets Jerry's Deli. It's all about the dumplings plus so much more. A great spot for families, kids, moms and dads alike to dig in their chopsticks and chow down on chow fun, green beans and those tender juicy dumplings. Chengdu Taste 828 W. Valley Blvd., Alhambra, (626) 588-2284. The pleasure of pain comes with your hot pot of chili. In fact, food here it is so fork-meltingly fiery you'll get a spoonful of Sichuan sizzle instead. Try the hot pot and discover how tasty pain can be.

7,BLACK VOICES,21 Signs You Might Be The 'Real Racist',Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/real-racist-conservatives_n_7656994.html,,2015-06-29,"CHARLESTON, SC - JUNE 21: People hold hands as they join together on the Arthur Ravenel jr. bridge to commemorate the lives lost in the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on June 21, 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina. Dylann Roof, 21 years old, is suspected of killing nine people during a prayer meeting in the church, which is one of the nation's oldest black churches in Charleston. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0e782100000001c6c3f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""You know who talks about race? Racists.""That was an actual line delivered in August by Jonathan Hoenig, a wealthy, white hedge fund founder, as he and other members of a Fox News panel tried to dismiss the significance of race and racial inequality in the protests then rocking Ferguson, Missouri.This shallow reductionism is a symptom of what we'll call the ""I know you are, but what am I"" school of racial thought. Followers of this model typically respond to such conversations by jamming their fingers in their ears and yelling ""nananana."" If the debate gets too loud to drown out, they might unplug their ears and lash out at anyone who challenges them to confront the nation's painful legacy of racism and to consider that is it not fully behind us. The fixation on race, they claim, can only be the product of individuals who themselves harbor racial prejudice.This is a defensive reflex to a difficult topic of discussion -- and in few circles is it exhibited more regularly than among white conservatives. Race is a particularly thorny issue for those who subscribe to a political ideology that insists racism has largely been eliminated from modern society. After all, to concede that racism is still a deep-seated, systemic problem would likely complicate the long-held conservative position that policies designed to rectify inequities in criminal justice, economics, education, housing, voting and other areas are both unnecessary and unfair (to white people).There is also a broader emotional aspect to this discomfort and denial. In a blog for The Good Men Project, Robin DiAngelo, a white professor of multicultural education at Westfield State University, unpacks the role ""white fragility"" plays in keeping large segments of the population across the political spectrum from taking the first step toward dismantling institutional racism: admitting that it exists.This hypersensitivity stems from the belief that ""if we are well-intended and do not consciously dislike people of color, we cannot be racist,"" DiAngelo writes. Being called a racist is now among the worst possible insults, she notes.Systemic racism isn't just about the individual. But white people are often resistant to have a conversation calling the system that benefits them into question. So they may instead shut the whole thing down and suggest that anyone who forces them into this prickly position is a racist.If asking people to think about race is a racist thing to do -- here are some signs you might be one of these ""real racists:""1. You talk about race.2. You talk about your own experience with racism.3. You tweet about race -- perhaps ""incessantly.""4. You believe racism is still a systemic problem in the United States.5. You suggest that the broad denial of this problem may in fact be proof of its existence.6. You insist that the most extreme manifestations of this race problem can end in acute tragedy...7. But point out that institutional racism causes much more than just physical harm.8. You encourage black activism, or activism of any kind on the issue of race.9. You support activism of any kind on the issue of race.10. You organize, protest and demonstrate, perhaps so enthusiastically that it's become a full-time job.11. You push for police reform and accountability, but may not have attended the funeral of an officer slain in the line of duty.12. You call out the racial double standards that are applied across society.13. You ask white people to consider their privilege.14. You refuse to temper your rhetoric so that white people still feel ""comfortable.""15. You challenge the institution of whiteness in any way at all.16. You're a politician who puts civil rights on your campaign platform.17. You're the first black president and you say the n-word in a nuanced effort to explain that just because this word is no longer viewed as acceptable doesn't mean racism is a relic of the past.18. You say ""black lives matter"" and believe this point bears repeating because it's apparent that some people and institutions don't agree.19. You don't give equal attention to ""anti-white racism"" -- or ""reverse racism"" -- because while bias certainly can appear in this form, it isn't indicative of the overwhelming trend of racial prejudice in American society.20. You don't think ""black-on-black crime"" is the real problem, because the people who claim it is only seem to care about it when they want to deflect other conversations about racism.21. You are Slate's Jamelle Bouie, The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates, activists Johnetta Elzie or DeRay Mckesson, Al Sharpton, or any other black person who has called attention to the issue of race."
8,HEALTHY LIVING,What You Eat Isn't What You Get: The 6 Troubling Ingredients Hiding in Your Food,"Dr. David Samadi, ContributorChairman of Urology, Chief of Robotic Surgery at Lenox Hill Ho...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-you-eat-isnt-what-yo_1_b_7670786.html,,2015-06-29,2015-06-24-1435176657-1833342-6DeadlyIngredientsinProcessedFoods.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-24-1435176657-1833342-6DeadlyIngredientsinProcessedFoods-thumb.png,"Let's start with the problem. The problem today is obesity and diabetes are on the rise. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about one-third of American adults are obese. The American Diabetes Association estimates that 29.1 million Americans have diabetes and 86 million Americans ages 20+ have pre-diabetes. What's more, metabolic syndrome affects about one in three U.S. adults, according to a JAMA Study published in May 2015. Why is this happening? In one word, our food. In two words, processed foods. Food makers have adopted processed production methods over the last 30 years and consumers have welcomed them with open arms. Processed foods are packaged -- be it boxed, bagged, canned or jarred -- and processed using methods like dehydration, refrigeration, freezing and canning. If there's a laundry list of ingredients on the back of the packaging, rest assured it's been processed. Processed foods have to make up for a loss of nutrients. How do they do this? Healthy nutrients are replaced with synthetic vitamins and minerals to ""enhance"" the nutritional value of the food. As a result, our taste buds become acclimated to the incredibly strong flavors of processed foods and even further, increase our cravings for more salt and sugar on whole or raw foods. This leaves us to where we are today. We really don't know how to eat healthy or even where to begin. The truth is we barely understand the foods we eat and we don't invest enough time to learn. The book Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser brought to light many of the facts about fast food and processed food and according to his research, about 90 percent of the average American's budget is allocated towards processed foods.Why We Eat Processed Foods Convenience seems to be the major reason for the high consumption of processed foods. The problem has surmounted to be about time. Who has hours upon hours to spend in the grocery store aisle analyzing nutritional labels, ingredient lists and Googling what they are, to then return home, prepare a meal without a lot of additives and actually enjoy the meal they end up with? The culture of food in America has changed in the last 30 years and we need to reverse it. Eating a diet high in processed foods has been shown to lead to diabetes, according to a PNAS study from 2012, and liver disease, not to mention these foods increase cholesterol and blood pressure -- all proponents of heart disease. Did you know the FDA doesn't require food makers to disclose every ingredient or additive, for consideration and full review, if the manufacturer deems the ingredient GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe), a 57-year-old regulatory law from the FDA. This means if this standard is ""met"" or ""claimed,"" food makers get away scot-free from the FDA, especially if no immediate evidence exists proving the harm of the ingredient. Some synthetic chemicals injected into processed foods are known to have carcinogenic properties, promoting the development of cancer. The World Health Organization believes processed foods are to blame for the spike in obesity levels and chronic disease globally. The Six Troubling Ingredients High Fructose Corn Syrup High fructose corn syrup is a common sweetener added to sodas, fruit-flavored drinks, breakfast cereals, cookies, cakes and salad dressings. There are many differing opinions on understanding if the body metabolizes HFCS in the same way it does regular white sugar. Regardless, too much of this additive can contribute to unwanted calories that have been linked to weight gain, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and high triglyceride levels, which all can boost the risk of heart disease, obesity, cancer, dementia and liver failure. A significant 2014 study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine showed that eating too much added sugar may raise the risk of dying from heart disease, even if you aren't overweight. Refined White Flour When flour is refined, about 14 vitamins, 10 minerals and proteins are cut from the natural state of the product. Sometimes you'll see ""enriched white flour"" in the ingredient list. Don't be deceived, this only adds about four vitamins to the product. White flour is chemically bleached and leaves behind a residue that is consumed. These chemical residues are also what help to develop gluten, which some people suffer allergies towards. Bleached white flour can be found in breakfast cereals, pasta, pizza, baked goods and breads. In order to process these refined foods, the body actually pulls the vitamins, minerals and enzymes consumed from healthy food sources out of the organs, tissues and bones. A diet rooted in eating foods with white flour can also lead to chronic fatigue syndrome. Refined white flour also has a higher glycemic index -- a measurement of how fast sugar is released in the blood -- which at a level of 100 means sugar is being released faster and in a greater amount, leading to Hyperglycemia. On a simpler note, once all of this stripped away, white flour is a starch and your body is likely to store these refined carbohydrates as fat, contributing to obesity. Look for ""enriched flours"" or ""refined flours"" on the packaging; this indicates white, bleached flour. Refined Sugar Ahh, refined sugar or commonly known as white (granulated) sugar, perhaps the most deadly ingredient on this list. It's nearly impossible to remove sugar completely from our diet, since it's naturally found in most foods. But refined sugars can directly impact an individual's risk for obesity and other chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. These sugars can be found in almost every processed food from baked foods, to boxed macaroni and cheese. The average American consumes approximately one-third of a pound of sugar each day, translating into nearly 130 pounds of sugar per person every year. Artificial Sweeteners Think Splenda, Sweet n' Low or Equal, more substantial evidence has been uncovered about the harms of artificial sweeteners in the last five years than ever before. Earlier this year, PepsiCo announced they would no longer use aspartame in their Diet Pepsi product. Aspartame, a popular artificial sweetener, has long been a controversial ingredient, even though the FDA claims it's one of the most thoroughly tested and studied food additives. Well, a number of studies have shown that aspartame in particular along with other sweeteners are linked to some of the most debilitating diseases including heart attacks, strokes, hypertension, cancer, obesity, Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Over 6,000 food and drink products contain it, often hidden under labels marked ""diet"" or ""sugar-free."" Even with substantial evidence, artificial sweeteners remain popular among dieters and even diabetic patients looking for a sweet fix. But research speculates that when we consume sugar substitutes, the body expects to see a surge in glucose and when this expectation is not met, we continue to crave sweets, consuming food until the craving is met. Synthetic Trans Fats Last week, the FDA announced a three-year deadline for all food makers to eliminate synthetic trans-fat or ""partially hydrogenated oils"" from their products. These oils are the key source of trans fatty acids in the American diet. As a result, medical experts are rejoicing since major bodies of evidence exist that show an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer from heavy consumption of these fats. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,trans fats are found naturally in animal fats but PHOs are found in baked goods. Food makers have used these for many years because they're inexpensive and extend the food's shelf life. The problem? Artificial trans fat raise low-density lipoprotein or LDL (the bad cholesterol), which is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, the number one cause of death in America. The CDC projects eliminating these fats could prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths per year. MSG Topping the charts of dangerous additives is MSG or monosodium glutamate. The good news is many studies have been done on its effect on the body. This additive is not just in your Chinese food, but added to thousands of the foods you eat, especially prevalent in processed foods. MSG overstimulates our nervous system, exciting the nerves, causing inflammation -- a massive proponent for cancer. One 2013 study showed rats who ate MSG experienced a 40 percent increase in their appetite. In 2011, researchers at the University of North Carolina found that both men and women who ate the most MSG (an average of 5 grams per day) were 30 percent more likely to become overweight. Our food culture in America needs a lot of reform. Bottom line, we need to spend more time on educating ourselves about the ingredients in our foods. In a perfect world, processed foods would be cut from our diet completely, but it's not that simple. Who loves dining out? We all do and how do we know what in those foods? Many questions remain along with differing opinions, but one fact remains, these six ingredients among thousands of others are not natural. They're designed to withstand long periods of time on a shelf regardless of temperature; how can we expect our bodies to break them down? We can't. Ask more questions when it comes to the foods on your grocery list. When you're about to eat that cracker or cookie, ask yourself, ""What's in this?"" and ""Do I need it?"" Be your own advocate when it comes to the food choices you make."

In this post, I chat with Jonny more about his own career and work. Still to come are Q&As with Ben Caird, writer/director of the film, and Quinton Aaron, star of Halfway.Be sure to scroll to the end to find out where you can find Halfway online!Thank you, Jonny, for being so generous with your time and thoughts!Q: Can you give me a general overview of your background?A: I studied at the University of Leeds to get a BA in English Literature and History (Joint Honors) and then went to Carnegie Mellon University to get a Master in Entertainment Industry Management. I worked at a talent agency called ICM briefly before moving on to Lionsgate Entertainment, then I got my job working for Paula Wagner. I assisted her for a year before setting up my own production company, JP International Productions in 2013. I also sit on the board of UK-based charity Football Aid where I have been a non-Executive director for the past five years. The charity was formed in 2001 and has a focus on raising funds to put towards finding a cure for Juvenile Type-1 diabetes. I myself am a Type-1 diabetic.  Jonny and Quinton Aaron with local Montfort businesswoman Marva Becker © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: What first sparked your interest in films and the entertainment industry? A: The truth is, coming from a wee country like Scotland, I never really thought having a career in ""Hollywood"" was realistically attainable. I've always been ambitious, but that career path still seemed a bit fantastical. However, as I was preparing to graduate during the recession in 2010, my job prospects were pretty bleak (as was the case for most graduates with liberal arts degrees at the time!). So I started looking further afield and came across a great program at Carnegie Mellon University, which would allow me to get a business degree at the same time as working in an internship capacity in Hollywood. The truth is, when I made it on to that program and subsequently moved to California after a year in Pittsburgh, I still didn't know what my calling was going to be career-wise, but I was definitely excited to go on the ride and find out.Q: What sparked your interest in being a producer?A: Things started to take shape when I got a call from a friend of mine who was Paula Wagner's assistant saying a position was opening up at her company and she'd like to put me forward for it. The opportunity to learn from someone like Paula was really huge for me, and her reputation as one of the top producers in the industry is renowned. I worked for Paula for a year and got to see what it really meant to be a producer, and a great producer at that. I started to learn that unlike the last couple of places I had worked, where every day kind of felt the same, the total opposite applied to working in production where every hour through up a new set of things to deal with. I loved that it kept me on my feet all the time, and decided thereafter that it was indeed my calling and have been 100 percent focused on making a success out of myself ever since.Q: What does a producer do, more specifically than ""everything""? A: The reason that producers often give the answer ""everything"" is because it's not actually that far from the truth! Or at the very least, they have a hand in every major decision that gets made from start to finish, so it always feels like ""everything."" However, to put that in the context of Halfway and to offer some examples, my function on the project ranged from finding the source material and ""optioning"" it (basically getting the exclusive right to produce the material), to bringing Quinton on board as our star and as an executive producer, to drawing up the budget and raising the money, to working out the logistics of getting everyone from LA/Chicago/NYC/London to a small town called Montfort in Wisconsin (a nightmare task!), and then, during production, running the set and making sure everyone had what they needed to do their jobs properly, especially Ben, the [writer and] director, whose vision it was we were all ultimately trying to bring to fruition.Now that we are in post-production, I have a whole slew of new job functions, but I think you get the point. Basically, I am the only producer on the film and thus I have to take on all the responsibility to make sure the boat sails as smoothly as possible. Jonny with writer/director Ben Caird between scenes © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: What do you love about producing? What do you not love as much?A: As I intimated in a previous answer, there is a lot of energy to be mined from doing a job that is constantly evolving and presenting different working parameters on a daily basis. I love waking up in the morning with but a few things on my schedule, yet knowing that by 9 a.m. I'm going to have a backlog of things I need to get done before the day's end. In a practical sense, in pre-production on Halfway I was very much learning on the job and taking things in my stride, but I can say fundamentally that no two days in a row were the same. Certainly there were successes and failures that overlapped with each other, but I was very much taking the bull by the horns and making things happen without having a blueprint as to how to achieve my goals. I was informed when getting in to production that ""no two films are the same,"" which is to say that each time I work on a film I will inevitably come up against challenges that will be fresh and unique to anything I've done before. I'm really energised by that, and it forces me to focus more and work harder each and every day.Over the past two years, the other thing that has been a pillar of my success thus far has been my desire and ability to find new talents. On Halfway that would be Ben Caird, on my next project that is someone else and so on and so forth, and that's incredibly exciting and something I love about producing.As to what I don't love so much, at the risk of contradicting myself, there is an uncertainty about where your next project or pay check is coming from that at a certain point isn't going to be healthy for me. The film industry is notoriously slow moving and there is a great saying that those in my position will understand only too well, and that is that we are always ""running so that we can walk."" That is to say, we have short bursts (a week here, a week there) which provide fireworks and incredible jolts of energy for a project that you're involved with that is truly the most adrenalin-infused, exciting thing in the world. However, you get through that week and then things slow down and the realisation is that, yes, last week was awesome, but this week we need to stop and think, and then get on with the paperwork etc., and then eventually, weeks or months down the line, all the awesomeness of that one week will finally bear some fruits. Running to walk! Jonny and crew on set © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: What are your short- and long-term career goals?A: Short term: Successfully guide Halfway through the remainder of the post-production process and towards a premier later this year/start of next year. Thereafter I have two projects in particular that I am focused on and would like to make, one, titled The Scavengers, that I'll be making in Ireland, and the second is one I can't divulge too much about at this stage, but would be a step up for me in terms of scope and commercial potential.Long term: To build a company that affords a sustainable lifestyle for me and my family. That probably looks like one to two movies per year for the foreseeable future, and as I mentioned previously, I don't have particularly strict designs on scope or genre of film. I'd like to continue to make movies that I'm passionate about, whether they cost $1 million or $100 million. A nice blend of the two would be nice. Jonny and crew on set © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: With software and modern technology, people making movies on their iPhones, for example, the world of film is opening up to almost everyone. Do you think that's a good thing or bad thing, and why?A: A good thing. Ever since Thomas Edison was credited with giving birth to the motion picture industry in the late nineteenth century, it has constantly been faced with challenges that generally fit in to one of three categories: creative, economical, or technological. From the invention of ""talkies"" in the 1920s with The Jazz Singer to the birth of using colour in films, invention of television, the multinational conglomerate takeover of film studios that still exists today with companies like Time Warner and News Corp ruling the roost over Warner Bros and Fox respectively, the birth and subsequent demise of DVDs -- the list goes on. The important thing to know is that the film industry isn't going anywhere, it is simply evolving in a manner that fits in line with an historical precedent.I believe that in general it is a good thing that the process of content creation has become so easily accessible. I guarantee we will find an Academy Award-winning writer or director that started out making a short film that someone shot on their GoPro and that got 100,000,000 hits on YouTube (that number isn't exaggerated!). The downside to this current evolution is that we're yet to find a truly effective filter for finding the diamonds within the rough. There are a lot of cat videos that garner massive viewership, but that's not necessarily something that translates in to a great proof-of-concept idea for a feature film.Last week: Halfway: the movieComing next week: Q&A with Halfway writer/director Ben Caird.Coming in two weeks: Q&A with Halfway star Quinton Aaron.Find Halfway on Facebook and Twitter. © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Also published at pamstucky.com.Somewhere between funny and philosophical lies the truth in Pam Stucky's writing.

Ironically, Texas is the home of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down restrictive state laws as unconstitutional. Henry Wade was the District Attorney of Dallas County. Roe v. Wade ruled that state restrictions on abortion violated numerous civil rights, including those protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Despite more than a decade of extraordinary abortion safety, a subsequent Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey opened the door to state interference with a woman's access to abortion. It allowed state abortion restrictions, provided they did not pose an undue burden on a woman's access to abortion. That hopelessly ambiguous criterion and the recent Republican takeover of many state legislatures led to an epidemic of state laws based not on public health but, rather, on personal opinions. In the first quarter of 2015, more than 300 such bills have been introduced in state legislatures...all in the absence of any public health need.Turning back the clock on women Republicans sponsoring this legislation apparently have a short memory. They appear unaware of the reasons why physicians and clergy led the drive five decades ago to liberalize abortion laws: American women were suffering and dying in large numbers. They could not countenance the needless carnage. For example, in 1947, the year that I was born, more than 700 U.S women died from unsafe abortion, and the population of the nation was half that of today. In Texas, 33 women were reported to have died from unsafe abortion in 1947, which is about three times the numbers who die annually in the entire United States today. Clandestine abortion in Texas was common and dangerous.Abortion has been with us as long as has pregnancy. It will not go away. Should safe, legal abortion become inaccessible (the goal of Republicans), women in large numbers will choose other options. Some will travel long distances at great expense to obtain safe care. Some will attempt to abort themselves. Others will turn to the back alley. The deadly lessons of Prohibition A century ago, ""do-gooders of the day"" led the charge to restore the virtues of the nation and abolish alcohol consumption. After ratification of the 18th Amendment, the nation went dry in January of 1920. Consumption of alcohol was not banned; the manufacture, distribution, sale and transport were outlawed. Affluent citizens were able to skirt the law; the poor were less fortunate. During Prohibition, an estimated 10,000 Americans died from consuming poisoned beverages, including denatured alcohol, methyl alcohol and Sterno, a canned heating fuel. Liquor poured into a sewer after a raid in New York City Photo: Library of Congress Gangsters fill the void When the bars closed, illegal ""speakeasies"" quickly met the public's quest for spirits. By 1925, an estimated 100,000 illegal drinking establishments were operating in New York City alone. Before Prohibition, Cleveland had 1200 bars; by 1923 an estimated 3,000 ""speakeasies"" were operating. Corruption and contempt for the law were rampant. The true beneficiaries of Prohibition were criminals, like Al Capone and Arnold Rothstein. Enforcement of Prohibition proved impossible. When the stunning failure of this ""noble experiment"" became incontrovertible, the 21st Amendment repealed this dangerous social policy in 1933.The tragic legacy of Prohibition Prohibition had little net effect on personal drinking. Instead, Prohibition spawned dangerous alternatives to safe alcohol, corruption of police and public officials, racketeering and international travel to access safe liquor. Thousands of Americans died needlessly as a result of well-intended ""social reformers"" forcing their views on the nation. After the repeal of Prohibition, states and municipalities could choose to remain dry. For example, Mississippi finally repealed Prohibition in 1966. Still today, ""red"" states with the poorest health status of women and children are those with the most regressive social policies. The largest still in captivity Photo: Library of CongressProhibition's ""evil consequences"" The Rev. Sam Small, an evangelist and temperance advocate, said that Prohibition had created 'an orgy of lawlessness and official corruption.' John D. Rockefeller, a teetotaler, observed in 1932, 'drinking has generally increased, the speakeasy has replaced the saloon and a vast army of lawbreakers has been recruited and financed on a colossal scale.'Santayana's warning Harvard philosopher George Santayana warned that those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat its errors. As Texas continues its drive to make safe, legal abortion inaccessible for large numbers of women, the consequences of this social policy are predictable. Affluent women will often be able to find safe care; the poor will not. Dangerous, unskilled practitioners will fill the void. Complications and deaths will increase, as will costs to the state, which will have to treat preventable complications of unsafe abortions. As experience in Romania confirmed, when denied access to safe, legal abortion, desperate women will risk their lives to control their fertility. Many will die as a result. If the history of Prohibition has anything to teach us, the message is that ""it is counterproductive to try to legislate morality.""

So it should come as no surprise that watchdog groups estimate an unfathomable 1000+ Americans are killed every year by American police officers without any real consequences whatsoever. The majority of those killed are white Americans but the minority and African American population are disproportionally affected. African Americans make up 13 percent of the total population but 27 percent of those killed by law enforcement, per the report. If we are to take the daily uploads of citizen taken videos and watchdog reports as evidence -- we can see we now have a culture in law enforcement where demanding total obedience has become a priority over public safety. Comply or face death. We see it in the deaths of individuals like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Kelly Thomas, Rekia Boyd, Ezell Ford, Tamir Rice and so many others.In fact, only eight states require a verbal warning be given before law enforcement uses lethal force. (Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Tennessee, Utah and Washington). The Amnesty report provides much needed context after it was announced there will no charges for a Michigan police officer who escalated a disagreement with an unarmed teenager into violence which ended when the officer shot 17-year-old Deven Guilford seven times after a questionable traffic stop.Yesterday I released a short (emotional) commentary including the raw footage of 17-year-old Deven Guilford's death at the hands of what was in my opinion, a law enforcement officer with his motives and priorities completely upside down.

13,SPORTS,The Campaign: Cameron Payne's Journey From Obscurity To The NBA Draft,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cameron-payne-nba-draft_n_7678886.html,,2015-06-28,"NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 25: Cameron Payne leaves the stage after being selected 14th overall by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the First Round of the 2015 NBA Draft at the Barclays Center on June 25, 2015 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb78091200000c1010168e2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Quick flashes lit the hollow gray stairway when Cameron Payne walked through the door. He had already moved past the TMZ cameras outside. Now a few photographers wanted their shots.Payne, in a black designer T-shirt and blue jeans, paused for a picture or two, then pushed by them and into the small Tribeca pop-up studio where a crowd of 50 or so had already assembled for a local fundraiser. In a room the size of a luxury Manhattan apartment, expensive paintings lined bleach-white walls, and guests sipped on Champagne and cocktails. Two short years ago, Cameron Payne was a lightly recruited point guard who landed at mid-major Murray State University, a proud basketball program but one hardly known for sending players to the next level. Now, he was a highly touted NBA draft prospect, on the cusp of completing a rise not even those closest to him saw coming.The night before he might realize his biggest dream, the most improbable of the 20 players invited to attend the draft spent a few hours looking at contemporary art.Cool and collected, without a hint of unease about what lay ahead of him over the next 24 hours, Payne ambled through the room with friends, family and his agent in tow. A painting hanging in a corner opposite the most crowded part of the room caught Payne’s eye.“The Best Ever,” its black paint screamed, the slogan surrounded by a dollar sign, a minimalist American flag, and other symbols. Black paint on a white canvas, its only splash of color came in the red gloves of the stick-figure boxer in the bottom right corner.Payne, determined to prove he belonged at the draft and in the NBA, said later that he viewed the piece’s simple message as “a way to get focused” on that goal.Ten minutes after Payne first saw the painting, the event’s host clinked two bottles of Champagne together to gather the crowd. He’d just made his first sale. Payne bought the painting that captured his attention, a Tonia Calderon piece listed for $250 as a print and $2,200 for the original. He wouldn’t say how much he paid -- the proceeds of everything sold at the event went to help provide free dental care to low-income New Yorkers -- but it didn’t count as Payne’s first NBA purchase. “I ain’t got none of that money yet,” he said. How does a 20-year-old NBA draft prospect whose life is about to change end up at an art show?“I just like style,” Payne said later. “I like the swag.”“He’s a different kind of cat,” his brother Tony Payne Jr. laughed.* * * * *The frenzied few days leading up to the NBA draft are packed with photo shoots, autograph signings, and various appearances next to promoters and media personalities who want a small piece of the action. It culminates, for those players invited to attend, in a butterfly-inducing draft night spent sitting at a ritzy table in a flashy suit -- in Payne’s case, a blue double-breasted jacket he kept hidden from his parents and friends until the big night -- waiting for NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to call your name. It is an evening when college athletes, forbidden from making money off their talents in the years before, take their first step toward becoming multimillionaires, a night when a team’s fans start showering their newest faces with love or, for the unlucky soul selected by the Knicks, immediate disdain.For those who starred on a collegiate powerhouse in front of fans obsessed with their teams -- like the Kentucky and Duke players in attendance this week -- the whole process may seem like an exaggerated extension of their previous lives. When you play ball in the Ohio Valley Conference, it seems inevitable that the attention will become overwhelming.It didn’t take long for Payne to notice the biggest difference between himself and the rest of the players invited to attend Thursday night’s draft. Scouring the list of invitees, one name stood out.Kentucky. Wisconsin. Duke. Arizona. Murray State.“I’m the only one,” Payne said, recalling the moment when he looked at his invitation for the first time. “All these guys who played for Final Four teams, and we didn’t even make the tournament. I’m the only mid-major guy here.”Payne, a product of Memphis’ Lausanne Collegiate School, hadn’t received the glut of scholarship offers his fellow invitees had out of high school. Once at Murray State, the university tucked into the 22nd-largest city in Kentucky, he never received the nationwide media attention that awaited players at Duke, Kentucky or Wisconsin. Payne’s parents figured he’d play four years for the Racers before he tried to latch on somewhere in the NBA. A tour of overseas leagues seemed more likely.Instead, he took advantage of an injury to Murray State’s starting point guard his freshman year and never looked back, averaging 18 points and 6 assists over two seasons. As a sophomore, he was one of just three players in the country to average 20 points and 5 assists per game, and his play during the Racers’ 25-game winning streak this spring caught the attention of scouts and draft analysts alike. In mock drafts, his name started popping up in the first round.It all came to a head Thursday night at the Barclay’s Center, the Brooklyn arena where Payne and the others waited to learn their professional fates. Payne’s draft week had gotten off to a shaky start. A delayed flight kept him in his native Memphis hours longer than expected, meaning his schedule upon landing in New York was even more condensed than planned. After weeks of hopscotching the country from workout to workout for various NBA teams, he crisscrossed Manhattan before the draft for photo shoots, media appearances and other NBA-mandated events. Payne had never even been to New York. When he finally got to the Westin, the midtown hotel where the NBA housed players and their families for the week, autograph seekers swarmed his car. The first time he and his family drove through Times Square, Payne gawked at the huge video boards overhead and stared in amazement at the number of people lining the streets. When he got to media day, he faced the kind of attention players at programs like Murray State rarely get.From the beginning, Payne dealt with the draft with a confidence and bombast his parents said was a natural element of his personality. He at times leaned on tired and clichéd talking points -- he’d be happy to go anywhere, of course. But once those were out of the way, he added his own flavor to the pre-draft process. With a touch of political flair, he referred to his journey to the draft, and the subsequent career he envisioned, by citing his nickname: ""The Campaign."" In pre-draft interviews, Payne declared himself one of the draft’s best guards, right up there with Ohio State’s D’Angelo Russell, a projected top-three pick, and Emmanuel Mudiay, once the nation’s top high school recruit. He spoke in the third person, making it known that “there is no ceiling for Cameron Payne.” He said he wanted to follow in the footsteps of fellow mid-major guard Damian Lillard, who won Rookie of the Year after the Portland Trailblazers drafted him out of Weber State in 2012.With its “Best Ever” scrawl, the painting he bought Wednesday was on message. If he wasn’t supposed to be here, if he held any disbelief in his ability or his place among the players who’d made their names on much bigger collegiate stages, he didn’t show it. “If he’s nervous, I can’t tell,” Tony Payne Jr., Cameron’s older brother by four years, said on the eve of the draft. “It’s crazy how he’s taking the situation. He’s happy, but he’s kind of like, ‘It’s just the draft.’”After the art show, more than 40 friends and family members gathered in the deepest of back rooms at Cove Lounge, a bar in Harlem. Payne lapped up the moment.“In less than 24 hours,” he yelled into the bright lights of the NBA TV documentary crew that had followed him all day, “I’ll know my team.” The room erupted in cheers. Payne started to dance.* * * * *At Cove, Payne snagged a seat -- and as much solitude as was available at a 40-person party -- at the end of the bar. The day had started more than 14 hours before and still had a few hours of partying to go. The TVs above him blasted non-stop draft coverage. He sliced off small pieces of the steak in front of him and never looked up. It was after 10 o’clock, and this was his first meal of the day.A few minutes later, he dipped into a hallway lit with neon blue lights, and the guard came down, if only for a minute. Payne used to tell his parents and his brother that he’d be here, like this, after just two years of college. He never quite believed it.“I was planning on going to school four years, getting my degree, trying to play overseas, try to get a coaching job,” he said. “It wasn’t nothing like, ‘I’m gonna play two years and go to the NBA.’”Still, the two-year prediction wasn’t just “something crazy” he’d come up with. ""It was a goal,"" he said. Memphis high schools have produced numerous talented point guards, and Tony Payne Sr., who played the point himself, can rattle off the names: Larry Finch, Andre Turner, Penny Hardaway, all of whom stayed home to play their college ball at the University of Memphis. But even after winning a state title and a Mr. Basketball award as a senior, Cameron Payne never earned much attention from the Tigers.When he broke out in college two years later, he did it at Murray State, in the statewide and national shadows of a Kentucky team pursuing season-long perfection. An upset loss in the OVC tournament final cost the Racers an NCAA Tournament berth, robbing Payne of his chance to prove himself on college basketball’s biggest stage.Payne has “been doubted his whole life,” at every level of basketball, his brother said, and the slights, both real and perceived, popped up in conversation. Upon his return to Memphis after weeks of pre-draft workouts, Payne remembered, he received interview requests from local news stations that had paid him no attention before. The delayed flight stung because he knew he wasn’t going to get “the same love as those big-time guys” in New York, and being late might only make it worse. The Campaign grew out of others’ constant doubt that he belonged, out of the desperation for a chance to prove he actually did. It isn’t anywhere near its end.“I’m going to have something to prove until I’m 90 years old. I mean, God bless me, if I become a 16-time All-Star, they’re bringing in some rookie trying to take my spot, just like I am now,” he said. “There’s never going to be a point where I don’t need to get better. I’m never going to find my ceiling.”Now, Payne was on the brink, and over eight weeks of workouts and the last 48 hours of travel and pre-draft euphoria, he hadn’t had time to get nervous. He figured he’d maybe get a few hours of sleep Wednesday night. (His agent, Travis King, laughed at that notion: “None of them can sleep."") But even if he was doing his best to obscure it, nerves were there.“I don’t know anybody who’ll say they’re not nervous,” Payne said. “If there’s anybody who says they’re not nervous, they’re the most nervous.”He had an idea of where he’d go -- somewhere between the sixth and 14th picks was his best guess -- but admitted that he'd start freaking out a bit if other names kept rolling off the board. “Once you get to nine, 10, you start thinking,” he said, staring at the ceiling. “That’s when I’m going to get anxious.”He paused.“I just want to put on that hat."" * * * * *When Thursday night finally arrived, Cameron Payne sat on the floor of the Barclay’s Center in a bright blue double-breasted suit jacket as those names began rolling off the board: Karl Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Jahlil Okafor. The hometown crowd booed when the Knicks took Latvia’s Kristaps Porzingis. Nothing out of the ordinary.Pick six, the first in Payne’s range, sent Kentucky’s Willie Cauley-Stein to Sacramento. Denver used the seventh on another point guard, Emmanuel Mudiay. Eight, nine, and 10 passed. Indiana had hinted at a need for a more athletic point guard, but used the 11th pick on Texas big man Myles Turner. Two more came and went.Then, at 9:10 p.m. Thursday night, Cameron Payne got his hat.“With the 14th pick in the 2015 NBA Draft,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced, “the Oklahoma City Thunder select Cameron Payne, Murray State University.”Payne sprung from his chair and wrapped his arms around his mother, Leshawn, first and then Tony Sr. After an elaborate handshake with Tony Jr., who had already made plans to follow Cameron to his new city -- wherever that would be -- he waltzed up onto the platform. He slid the hat on. The Campaign was underway."

The offer said hotels could charge a reduced 13-percent tax, not the standard 23 percent.A Greek government official said Athens had not been sent the offer. FIGHT FOR EUROGreece's future in the euro zone is in doubt and it has had to consider capital controls to protect banks as it heads for a default on a 1.6 billion euro repayment due to the IMF on Tuesday.The high-stakes brinkmanship has put pressure on European Union institutions to demonstrate their effectiveness and relevance, and Juncker, a veteran premier of Luxembourg, has taken a lead in trying to steer the 40-year-old Tsipras to an accord, voicing irritation in recent weeks at repeated rebuffs.Juncker has called a Monday lunchtime news conference on the crisis. EU officials are not optimistic that Tsipras will shift but see it as the Commission's role to keep seeking a deal.Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which groups EU heads of government, said he was also still working with leaders to keep Greece in the common currency area.EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici insisted he was not giving up hope. ""To those who wonder what's next,"" he tweeted, ""1. Greece should stay in euro; 2. The door is still open for negotiations on latest EU Commission proposals.""That remark echoed comments by Michel Sapin, who succeeded Moscovici as finance minister in Socialist president Francois Hollande's French government, as well as French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Sunday.The conservative government of Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany, Greece's biggest creditor, has not concealed a loss of patience with Tsipras, the novice premier elected in January on a vow to end years of austerity. France, the second biggest creditor, has however been at pains to say the situation can be salvaged.IMF head Christine Lagarde, who has been urging EU leaders to be bolder in granting debt relief to Greece, also issued a statement on Sunday saying she was ready to keep on working.In its statement, the European Commission said euro zone governments had been ready to do more on the Greek debt.

According to a recent study by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, New York City's homeless population increased by 13 percent at the beginning of 2013.

In a 5-4 ruling, the Court found that the Fair Housing Act of 1968 requires plaintiffs to show only that the effect of a policy is discriminatory, not that defendants intended to discriminate.The decision is important to the fight against economic apartheid in America - racial segregation on a much larger geographic scale than ever before. The decision is likely to affect everything from bank lending practices whose effect is to harm low-income non-white borrowers, to zoning laws that favor higher-income white homebuyers.First, some background. Americans are segregating ever more by income in terms of where we live. Thirty years ago, most cities contained a broad spectrum of residents from wealthy to poor. Today, entire cities are mostly rich (San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle) or mostly impoverished(Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia).Because a disproportionate number of the nation's poor are black or Latino, we're experiencing far more segregation geographically. Which is why, for example, black students are more isolatedtoday than they were 40 years ago. More than 2 million black students now attend schools where 90 percent of the student body is minority.According to a new study by Stanford researchers, even many middle-income black families remain in poor neighborhoods with low-quality schools, fewer parks and playgrounds, more crime, and inadequate public transportation. Blacks and Hispanics typically need higher incomes than whites in order to live in affluent neighborhoods.To some extent, this is a matter of choice. Many people prefer to live among others who resemble them racially and ethnically.But some of this is due to housing discrimination. For example, a 2013 study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development found that realtors often show black families fewer properties than white families possessing nearly the same income and wealth.The income gap between poor minority and middle-class white communities continues to widen. While the recovery has boosted housing prices overall, it hasn't boosted them in poor communities.That's partly because bank loan officers are now more reluctant to issue mortgages on homes in poor neighborhoods - not because lenders intend to discriminate but because they see greater risks of falling housing values and foreclosures.But this reluctance is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It has reduced demand for homes in such areas - resulting in more foreclosures and higher rates of vacant and deteriorating homes. The result: further declines in home prices. As prices drop, even homeowners who have kept current on their mortgage payments can't refinance to take advantage of lower interest rates.Others who owe more on their homes than their homes are worth have simply stopped maintaining them. In many poor communities, this has caused the housing stock to decline further, and home prices to follow.Adding to the downward spiral is the fiscal reality that lower housing values mean less revenue from local property taxes. This, in turn, contributes to worsening schools, fewer police officers, and junkier infrastructure -accelerating the downward slide.All of which explains why housing prices in poor neighborhoods remain about 13 percent below where they were before the recession, even though prices in many upscale neighborhoods have fully rebounded. And why about 15 percent of the nation's homes worth less than $200,000 are still underwater while just 6 percent of homes worth more than $200,000 are.Worse yet for poor communities, most of America's new jobs are being created in areas where housing already is pricy, while fewer jobs are emerging in places where housing is cheapest.The toxic mixture of housing discrimination, racial segregation over wide swathes of metropolitan areas, and low wages and few jobs in such places, has had long-term effects.A Harvard study released in May suggests just how long. The study tracked several million children since 1980s.It found that young children whose families had been given housing vouchers allowing them to move to better neighborhoods were more likely to do better in later life - attend college and get better jobs - than those whose families hadn't received the vouchers.The study points to one solution: housing vouchers that help lower-income families move into better neighborhoods.It also suggests that federal tax credits to encourage developers to build housing for the poor should be used in racially-integrated communities, rather than mostly in poor ones.Not incidentally, this is the very issue that spurred last week's Supreme Court's decision on fair housing.If we want to reverse the vicious cycle of economic apartheid in America, that decision offers an important starting place.

(WDYTYA), will be back for its seventh season starting on July 26. Stepping into the ancestral spotlight this time are Tom Bergeron, Bryan Cranston, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Alfre Woodard. And happily for millions of Harry Potter fans, an episode of the original U.K. series focusing on J.K. Rowling will also be adapted and incorporated into the lineup.In recent years, seasons of assorted genealogy TV shows have been dovetailing with each other, allowing viewers to wallow in months of seamless family history programming, so it was reasonable to assume that the PBS celebrity heritage series, Finding Your Roots, would launch its next season on the heels of WDYTYA. Indeed, it was slated to begin in September, but that's now up in the air.Due to controversy stemming from an episode featuring Ben Affleck, PBS conducted an internal investigation and as a result, decided to put the next season on hold until certain measures are implemented, including employing ""an additional researcher/fact-checker"" and ""an independent genealogist to review all versions of program episodes for factual accuracy.""Among the impressive list of celebrities who have already taped with host and producer, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., for the upcoming season are Patricia Arquette, Lidia Bastianich, Richard Branson, Donna Brazile, Ty Burrell, LL Cool J, Mia Farrow, Bill Hader, Neil Patrick Harris, Dustin Hoffman, Jimmy Kimmel, Norman Lear, Maya Lin, Bill Maher, Julianna Margulies, John McCain, Julianne Moore, Azar Nafisi, Bill O'Reilly, Shondra Rhimes, Maya Rudolph, Gloria Steinem, Kara Walker, and Keenen Ivory Wayans. So when will the next season air? On the one hand, even if the concerns of PBS ombudsman, Michael Getler, regarding the Freedom Rider tale of Affleck's mother don't trigger additional investigation, the volume and diversity of this group of celebrities mean that the selected fact-checker and genealogist have some heavy lifting ahead of them, so that would seem to suggest that the next season will be considerably delayed. On the other hand, Getler also summarized viewer reaction as leaning against suspension: ""The mail was heavy and reflected different views but most of those who wrote to me expressed backing for the program and opposed postponing scheduling of the third season.""In all likelihood, then, we can probably expect an interlude between the next seasons of Who Do You Think You Are? and Finding Your Roots, and the duration of that lull will hinge largely on how PBS chooses to balance and accommodate the sometimes competing goals of content accuracy and viewer demand."

Scientific research proved pretty conclusively that being gay is not a choice but a matter of genetics. Some of us would argue that even if you could choose to be gay, you should still get the same rights and protections as those who ""chose"" to be straight. Scientific evidence, however, revealed not just the immorality of prejudice, but the irrationality of it too -- and completely changed the way ordinary people looked at the LGBT community. Without science, this Supreme Court decision might have been delayed another century until mere decency prevailed over the entrenched forces of American fundamentalism. This is the power of science: to quietly change and improve our lives through research and evidence. But sometimes science is too quiet. This is why I and many others -- Nobel laureates, science and tech stars, major science organizations, artists, politicians, university presidents and universities -- support ScienceDebate.org, an organization calling for televised public debates in which the U.S. presidential and congressional candidates share their views on science and technology policy, health and medicine, and the environment. The fact that science is complex and hard to talk about is the very reason why it must be talked about. Avoiding the subject allows it to become another form of magic, dangerously open to political manipulation and exploitation. This is brilliantly explained in this short TEDx talk by science writer and ScienceDebate.org board chair, Shawn Otto."

Talks between Iran and major powers on finalising a historic nuclear deal will go beyond the June 30 deadline, a spokesman for the Iranian delegation in talks in Vienna said Sunday.

They expected them to spill over into July.""Zarif will return to Tehran tonight and will come back to Vienna tomorrow,"" Iran's Tasnim news agency said, citing an unnamed Iranian official.An Iranian official told Reuters that Zarif would ""consult with the leadership"" over the talks in Vienna.The U.S. official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said Washington was not troubled by Zarif's decision to return to Tehran overnight, saying it was always expected that ministers would come and go from Vienna as the talks heated up.The negotiations aim to limit Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions on Tehran.The United States, Israel and some Western nations fear that Iran has been trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability, but Tehran says its program is for peaceful purposes only.The main differences are on the pace and timing of sanctions relief for Iran and on the nature of monitoring mechanisms to ensure Tehran does not cheat on any agreement.U.S. and European negotiators also want to ensure there is a mechanism for restoring sanctions if Tehran fails to meet its commitments under any future accord.In November, the seven nations involved in the talks set a late March deadline for a framework agreement, which they ultimately reached on April 2, and a June 30 deadline for a comprehensive deal.Highlighting how much work remains, British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond said on arrival in Vienna that major challenges remained, including on the parameters already agreed in April.""There are a number of different areas where we still have major differences of interpretation in detailing what was agreed in Lausanne),"" Hammond told reporters.""There is going to have to be some give or take if we are to get this done in the next few days,"" he said. ""No deal is better than a bad deal.""In addition to Britain, Iran and the United States, the talks include China, France, Germany and Russia.Speaking after a cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said too many concessions were being made to Tehran.""We see before our very eyes a stark retreat from the red lines that the world powers set themselves only recently, and publicly,"" said Netanyahu, whose country is generally believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal.""There is no reason to hasten into signing this bad deal, which is getting worse by the day.""(Additional reporting by Louis Charbonneau, Arshad Mohammed and Shadia Nasralla and Dan Williams in Jerusalem; Editing by Angus MacSwan)"
