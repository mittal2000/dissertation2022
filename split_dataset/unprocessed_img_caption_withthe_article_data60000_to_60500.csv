0,POLITICS,A Coal Baron Only Got A Year For His Crimes. One Woman Will Make Sure Every Day Of It Counts.,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/don-blankenship-sentence_us_5709442ae4b0885fb50d436e,"""Working with what we we got, how can we make this year more meaningful?""",2016-04-09,"Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was defiant at his sentencing on Wednesday, after he was found guilty of conspiring to violate mine safety standards.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570946dc1e0000b3007069ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was sentenced to just one year for safety violations at a West Virginia mine that led to the deaths of 29 miners in a 2010 explosion. Now, one woman is working to push Blankenship to reflect on his crimes.Ann Bybee-Finley, who grew up in Hurricane, West Virginia, launched a campaign called ""Making one year count"" on Wednesday, calling on people to send letters to Blankenship every day that he is in prison.She wants to show Blankenship how many people he affected and empower West Virginians to speak out against coal industry abuses in their state.Bybee-Finley told The Huffington Post she was inspired to start the campaign after seeing an emotional video in which Tommy Davis, whose brother, son and nephew were killed in the explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine, reacted to Blankenship's sentencing. Blankenship owned the mine and prosecutors said he knowingly ignored safety standards.""He only gets one year and nothing we can say or do will change that right now. Working with what we got, how can we make this year more meaningful?"" Bybee-Finley said. ""If we could make it longer, a lot of people would, but we can't, right now, so we have to take this alternative approach.""Blankenship could have been imprisoned for a maximum of 30 years, but he was found not guilty on more serious charges. He did receive the maximum sentence on the charge for which he was convicted, but part of the problem is the way the laws are written, according to Bybee-Finley.""You have to look at the legislation, how the laws were written, how the laws were made, who made the laws and what influence did these people have and I think if you start looking at these mining laws, you'll see a lot of industry influence,"" she said. ""I hope people see this as an example and say 'we have to do something different.' Where can we make this change to make this law more meaningful to have more strict enforcement?""Bybee-Finley posted her email address on a Facebook page announcing the campaign, where she pledged to print out what people send her and send Blankenship one letter a day once he begins serving his sentence. The letters don't have a particular format or structure and can be a poem or a list. The Cornell University Ph.D. student said that having grown up in West Virginia, she knows how hesitant residents are to speak out against the coal industry because everyone is in some way connected to it. She hopes her initiative will give West Virginians a voice to speak out.""[Showing people] you can speak to this former CEO, that is your right, you do have an ability to do that is one of the things that excited me the most about this campaign,"" she added."

That training time limits how many dogs he can deploy immediately.Neffenger said replacing the current security screening procedure used by most passengers with bomb-sniffing dogs would speed up lines at airports.Those lines at security checkpoints are both inconvenient for travelers and also create a security risk.Neffenger, who happened to be landing at the Brussels airport shortly after it was attacked on March 22, said moving lines would make it harder for attackers to pinpoint an area to cause maximum devastation.(Reporting by Julia Edwards)"

The charming British actor’s full name is actually Hugh John Mungo Grant, which prevents him from actually bearing the moniker “humungo.” But frankly, if you’re going to go ahead and give your child the first name “Hugh” and middle name “Mungo,” why not just go all the way and make it Hugh Mungo? No one is being fooled by this “John” business.And yes, it’s pronounced exactly how you’d think.The above video from 2011 shows Grant giving testimony in the Leveson Inquiry -- a judicial inquiry into British media ethics -- where he testified that U.K. publication the Mail on Sunday may have hacked his phone.It this new information? Absolutely not. The delightful fact was brought to our attention by Jezebel commenter NeverMindEdith, who made a note of Grant’s middle name on an article about a newly released oral history of the 2001 film “Bridget Jones Diary.” Grant plays a central role in the movie.NeverMindEdith’s comment made our afternoon about 10 times better, and now, we just want to pay it forward.We hope it brings you a Hugh-Mungo smile."

It's the practice of educating students with special educational needs. Eileen Soon is an educator who specializes in teaching this unique population - diverse learners and individuals with special needs. Graduating with a degree in Special Education from Liberty University, Eileen taught at St Christopher's International Primary School, Malaysia as their special education coordinator working with children with mild to moderate learning difficulties. There, she introduced social-communication groups for individuals on the Autism Spectrum. Later, she joined a private center for individuals with special needs to teach individuals with moderate to severe disabilities, setting up vocational training programs that build their skills There, she set up a vocational training program that not only gave students the opportunity to use real life experiences to build their skills but also bridged the gap between them and the community. This program enabled students with special needs be seen and heard, and brought about Autism awareness to people in the community. She is currently completing her Masters in Special Education at San Francisco State University where she obsesses over the ocean and blogs about her educational escapades. We spoke to her about her views on special education.S: What's your background?E: I was born and raised in Malaysia. I remember school being very textbook and test driven. We rarely did any hands-on learning. I spent 8 months in a public school in Colorado when I was 8 years old because my father was doing his Masters and I was amazed at how fun school could be. We had field trips, there were dress up days, I had never experienced anything like that before. I think that was probably when I started thinking about learning and how exciting it could be.S: How did you get into special education? What sparked your interest?E: I had thought about going into education and also thought about speech therapy. Education is so broad, I knew I needed to find a focus. A school for children with special needs opened up in my city and my dad suggested that I should go and volunteer since it is almost a cross between speech therapy and education. I volunteered there for two months - fell in love with these fascinating human beings! S: You mentioned coming up with a vocational program that ended up impacting the community. Tell me about that.E: I was working at a center for children with special needs in Penang, Malaysia, where we had a class of 13 to 19 year olds who were academically focused but, for some of them, going to university was not an option. They wanted to work instead. My team and I brainstormed ways we can help them. Sandwiches came to mind! We felt that sandwiches were quick and easy to make and easy to learn. So we coached the students every step of the way - from shopping for ingredients, food preparation, to setting up the pop-up store, greeting customers, money handling - we broke down every step for them. We went to a prominent hospital and set up a pop-up store to sell to doctors, nurses and patients. We were surprised by how well the community received the students! People started asking us questions and we started a conversation about autism and special needs. The students, instead of being shy and reserved, rose to the occasion and took ownership of the store, giving customers a rundown of what they were selling, who they are and why they were there. Many commented about knowing a friend with a child with special needs and finding new found hope that these individuals have a bright future ahead of them - what they see here with the sandwiches was only the beginning. This sort of boundary breaking is exactly what our community needs.S: If you had the power to do anything, how would you choose to advance special education?E: Anything? Not specifically for special education, but education in general, but if anything were possible, I think I would love to have a reality TV show showcasing educators presented with challenges that they had to overcome. I envision it to be like Master Chef or Project Runway, but for education. If it works for food and fashion, why not education right? Teachers would have to get creative with their lessons, tackle learning differences, manage behaviors with the resources available and get judged! It brings about awareness, brings education to the limelight and will produce ""teachies"", or ""teachanistas"" (foodies and fashionistas). If someone wants to start a show like that, hit me up!S: What are areas in which Special Education can continue to expand in?E: Education is going through (or desperately needs to go through) a metamorphosis, to put it mildly. It's form and functionality are being questioned by many successful creative minds of today. It seems that school success does not equate success in life; on the contrary, we see individuals who did not finish college, (Steve Jobs, Richard Branson, Mark Zuckerberg) go on to find their passions, hone their skills and impact the world. The question isn't whether education is important because everyone knows it is fundamental in life. The question, however, is whether schools today are relevant and properly equipping the students of this generation.There is scrutiny on what these standards of ""success"" should be. Contemporaries like Carol Dweck, Sir Ken Robinson, Brene Brown and Reshma Saujani (as you can tell I'm a huge TED fan!) are echoing a similar theme - that creativity, innovation, tenacity and vulnerability are key in this generation, but the only way for that to happen is for the educational system to encourage it. Our system is not set up to build students to fail with a growth mindset, to teach tenacity instead of perfection, to admit to what they do not know and to be vulnerable enough to try something completely new, even if it means risking looking like an idiot. While there seems to be a great divide between the elements mentioned and keeping common core standards, I believe that with conversation between educational policy makers, and educators, students and parents, this dichotomy can be reconciled so that education can move forward.If these shifts happen in education, it will inadvertently impact special education because education will be communicated, presented, interacted with and demonstrated with greater accessibility. Individual strengths and styles will be embraced more openly. ADHD may actually be celebrated (with effective strategies put in place) instead of medicated. The future of education and consequently, special education, is exciting if we dare to reimagine it.S: It seems that you feel that education needs a revamp. What do you think first steps are that needs to be done?E: Yes, I personally believe education is in dire need for a revamp. It has stayed the same for decades - power point lectures, exams, tests, quizzes - especially in Asia. Sir Ken Robinson, author, an advisor on education, states that students are going through life not really understanding what they're good at because they haven't done well academically. Now with the discovery of multiple intelligences, schooling still seems to only exalt and nurture a couple of those intelligences. I feel we need to examine why we've stayed the same through the decades. Is it the resources? Is it that policy makers are not listening to educators when policies are implemented? Is it the nation's general outlook on the role of teachers? Is it the low salaries and low status views of teachers that is discouraging the highly qualified to step into education because it isn't a viable, profitable, reputable career? Why does teaching have to continue to be viewed solely as this noble profession where monetary gains isn't an important factor to consider? I believe we need to have these conversations for an educational revolution to happen.S: What is the one most fundamental thing a student with special needs must learn?E: To communicate. Over the years, I've come to see that communication is vital. Beneath many behavioral issues and academic disengagements is an issue of communication.S: If you could be given anything to further your career in education, what would you ask for?E: I'd ask for the chance to travel around the world to go into schools to see how different places run their schools. I'd love to visit urban schools, rural schools, radical schools, traditional schools. I've heard so much about schools in Finland and how they are among the best globally - I'd love to spend time in those classrooms to see what they're doing right.

So while we'll take care of the news (good and bad) in the awards section, we're going to also devote the talking points section to a list of questions we would love to hear answered by all the candidates. Obviously, the answers from Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are the most important, since they'd be the only ones who might actually try to improve the current situation, but it really shouldn't excuse the Republicans from having to answer them as well. Rather than just a quick ""Do you support medical marijuana?"" question, we really think the issue needs to be addressed in a little more depth.In non-marijuana news, the presidential campaign just keeps chugging along. This week was a good one for the underdogs, as both Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz won big in the Wisconsin primaries. Of course, this sent all the political pundits into a tizzy, all but declaring Donald Trump's campaign dead in the water. They seemed to collectively forget that the next big state to vote is New York, where Trump will quite likely crush the competition (Ted Cruz is already regretting that ""New York values"" dig he made toward Trump in an earlier debate). But until then, expect lots and lots of rampant speculation about an open Republican convention. Earlier this week, Salon pointed out that things could get quite ugly if the GOP does manage to wrest the nomination away from Trump (which led me to write about how the ""days of rage"" might actually come to pass). Short answer: Trump followers aren't just going to quietly accept Paul Ryan as the nominee. Far from it.On the Democratic side of things, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are getting a little more feisty in how they're referring to each other. The media is trying to turn this into some sort of ""open warfare,"" but what is really happening is they are both vying for New York voters. New Yorkers are a pretty brash and outspoken lot, so all we see is the candidates using rhetoric the crowd wants to hear, really. The New York contest is an interesting one because both Democrats can claim ""home state"" status here -- Bernie was born in New York City, and Hillary was the state's senator for eight years. Hillary has already won the other two states she can claim (Illinois and Arkansas) and Bernie won Vermont, so now New York will get to vote for either a ""favorite son"" or a ""favorite daughter."" So far, Hillary has the polling lead, but that could change after next week's debate, so stay tuned!Hillary tried to stage a photo op to tease Bernie about not knowing how to ride the subway in New York City (Bernie's ""you buy a token"" was a wee bit out of date), but she kind of blew it when she obviously didn't know how to use the farecard herself. This led to an amusing dig at Hillary from none other than Michele Bachmann.The other embarrassing news for Hillary this week came from her husband. Bill was interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters at a campaign event, and he tried to argue them into submission. This didn't work out as well as he might have planned, however. Bill tried to defend his own record as president, which is obviously personal to him, but in doing so he sounded rather dismissive of the opinions he was disagreeing with. This is not exactly helpful to Hillary right now, since any drop in African-American support for her could be disastrous in the next states to hold primaries. We'll have to wait and see just how big an impact Bill's back-and-forth with Black Lives Matter winds up having.And finally, in the most appropriate inadvertent acronym since George Bush wanted to call his invasion ""Operation Iraq Liberation,"" George Mason University announced last week that it was going to change the name of its law school to the ""Antonin Scalia School Of Law."" Because ASSOL (or even ASSLAW) is the perfect way to remember Scalia!Bernie Sanders deserves at least an Honorable Mention for chalking up an impressive 14 percent victory over Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin on Tuesday night, which was a much larger margin than anyone was predicting. This continues a winning streak for Bernie, and (importantly, for him) this was the first primary (as opposed to caucus) that Bernie won in that streak. He's now won seven of the last eight contests (six states plus Democrats Abroad), and if he wins again tomorrow night in Wyoming, this will improve to eight out of nine.[Program Note: For those playing along with our ""predict the primaries"" series of columns, this counts as my prediction: Bernie will indeed handily win the Wyoming caucuses tomorrow night.]At the end of the week, Bernie announced he'd be taking a day off the campaign trail to accept an invitation to address the Vatican on income inequality, also a favorite subject of Pope Francis. That's a pretty impressive way to cap off a pretty good week, we have to admit.But this week the Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award goes to eight Democrats in the Senate who sent a letter to the Drug Enforcement Agency posing some rather important questions about federal marijuana policy. These senators are: Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley, Ron Wyden, Barbara Mikulski, Ed Markey, Barbara Boxer, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand. All of them (except Warren) are also co-sponsors of a bill introduced last year ""designed to drastically reduce the federal government's ability to crack down on state-legal medical marijuana programs while also encouraging more research into the substance.""This effort was in the news because the D.E.A. finally responded in a 25-page letter of their own. The D.E.A. revealed that they were going to try (there were some weasel words used) to complete a review of the possibility of rescheduling marijuana on the federal list of controlled substances ""in the first half of 2016."" This means the law could change as early as this summer. They also revealed that they have already received a recommendation from the F.D.A. on the matter, but they did not reveal what it said.This is the key issue in ending the federal War On Weed (which I explained in detail yesterday, if anyone's interested). Take out this one stumbling block, and the rest of federal marijuana policy can start to change to a realistic and sane approach, in other words. So it's a big deal.For a long time, the D.E.A. under the Obama administration refused to face the new reality of states legalizing both medical and recreational marijuana. Finally, to the vast relief of drug policy advocates everywhere, last year Michele Leonhart stepped down from leading the agency. The decision on rescheduling marijuana simply would not have been possible under Leonhart, but there is hope with new leadership that the agency will finally move beyond the worst attitudes of the War On Drugs and start to help craft a new federal legal policy. It's too early to celebrate -- in their letter, the D.E.A. gave absolutely no hint which way it is going to act.But for spurring this process along, and for writing legislation to end some of the worst excesses from the past, we have to award the Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week to the eight senators who are showing real leadership on the issue.[Congratulate Senator Cory Booker on his Senate contact page, Senator Barbara Boxer on her Senate contact page, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on her Senate contact page, Senator Edward Markey on his Senate contact page, Senator Jeff Merkley on his Senate contact page, Senator Barbara Mikulski on her Senate contact page, Senator Elizabeth Warren on her Senate contact page, and Senator Ron Wyden on his Senate contact page, to let them all know you appreciate their efforts.]There was a Senate hearing on marijuana this week. It was a complete sham -- one of those hearings where only one viewpoint is even allowed in the room, where all the witnesses are selected so they can echo back the opinions the senators already hold. In this case, the opinion (as espoused by Jeff Sessions): ""that good people don't smoke marijuana.""The four witnesses called were: a critic of the Obama marijuana policy, a prosecutor ""who led raids on pot farms in California,"" a state attorney general who had sued Colorado over legalization, and a board member of an organization dedicated to stopping the legalization movement. Pretty fair and balanced, eh?Michael Collins of the Drug Policy Alliance doesn't think so, and doesn't mince words:These hearings are a one-sided sham with the deck stacked with witnesses who have a track record of vehemently opposing marijuana legalization. An honest evaluation of marijuana legalization would include the undeniable benefits of legalization, like the massive drop in marijuana arrests, the billions in taxes, and the transition from an underground market to a regulated one.But, of course, the senators weren't after any sort of honest evaluation -- they just wanted to hear the ""Drugs are bad... mmm'kay?"" refrain that has been soothing them since the 1980s. Sessions even spoke favorably about Nancy Reagan's ""Just Say No"" campaign, to provide a nostalgic glow.However, we expect this sort of thing from Republicans. They've been making political hay over the Drug War (and over law-and-order issues generally) for decades now. People like Chuck Grassley, who co-chairs the committee, are probably never going to change. They're permanently stuck in the past, where if we just throw another few million people in jail, the problem will be solved!What we find massively disappointing, though, is to see one of California's own senators enthusiastically joining in. Because Grassley's co-chair is none other than Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is described as being one of ""the Senate's most strident anti-drug crusaders,"" along with Grassley.DiFi has long been anti-weed. She actually led the effort against the previous legalization ballot measure in her state (Proposition 19, which failed back in 2010). If, as expected, Californians get another chance to vote on legalizing recreational marijuana this year, it wouldn't surprise us in the least to see ""vote no"" ads featuring DiFi.Feinstein is fighting a losing battle. History is moving in the exact opposite direction she is heading, in fact. Feinstein and her Republican buddies want to take America backwards, and return to an era of complete denial of reality. For enthusiastically participating in such a sham hearing, and for refusing to allow any witnesses who might have held a different opinion from her own, Dianne Feinstein is our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week this week.[Contact Senator Dianne Feinstein on her Senate contact page, to let her know what you think of her actions.]Volume 386 (4/8/16)If the Drug Enforcement Agency does follow through and issue a decision on rescheduling marijuana by summertime, it almost guarantees it will become a hot topic in the presidential race. Whether the D.E.A. decides to reschedule or not, the incoming president is going to have a big influence on federal marijuana policy for the next four years.But by summer, we should have a Democratic nominee. So it'll be too late for the issue to mean anything in the nomination race currently underway. So instead of talking points this week designed for Democrats to raise issues effectively, we are going to ask seven questions that we would sincerely like to hear both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton answer. Whenever the subject arises in a question to a candidate, it is often either posed or answered in very general terms (""Do you support legalization?"" for instance). We think this is a shame, because there are nuances and technical legalisms that really bear closer examination. If the next president is going to lead on the issue (rather than reluctantly follow the will of the people), they should really have thought about these things, and have answers for what they would do as president. So here are our questions for both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to answer. What would your administration policy be?First, a generic question. Depending on the answer to this, some of the other questions may not be necessary.""By the time you are sworn into office, over 10 states may have legalized recreational use of marijuana for all their adult citizens. However, federal law supercedes all of these new state laws. So far, the Obama administration has taken a somewhat hands-off attitude, but that could change under a new administration. So how would you deal with the new reality of perhaps one-fifth of the United States allowing legal recreational marijuana? As president, how exactly would you change federal law and Justice Department policy?"" Reschedule?The next two questions are really the most important, because they'd have the greatest effect on overall policy.""Currently, marijuana is listed as a Schedule I controlled substance. This classification means the federal government believes that marijuana is more dangerous than cocaine, PCP, crystal meth, and opium. Richard Nixon's administration made this classification, and it has never changed since. If the D.E.A. refuses to reschedule marijuana this summer, would you guarantee that you would do so as president? Which schedule would you move it to? Schedule II? Schedule III? Or even lower?"" Or deschedule?The commonsense solution needs to be asked about, as well.""There is already a federal bureau which has the responsibility of overseeing alcohol and tobacco. Wouldn't it make more sense to completely deschedule marijuana and hand off oversight of marijuana issues to the A.T.F.? Especially considering that the number of states where recreational marijuana is fully legal can only be expected to grow, over time?"" Freedom to travelProhibition didn't completely end, but local bans can only go so far.""When Prohibition ended, some states and counties refused to condone the sale of alcohol. There are still many of these 'dry' counties left, in fact. But a key point is that while it may be illegal to buy alcohol in any given county, it cannot be illegal there to possess or even consume alcohol (in the privacy of one's own home). A person can legally drive through a 'dry' county with a sixpack of beer in the car, and if they stopped at a hotel there they could legally drink that alcohol in their room. Would you support changing federal law so that no state can criminalize either simple possession or private use of marijuana, so that it would be treated the same way that alcohol is now treated under the law?"" Free the doctors!Don't let candidates get away with just a generic ""I support more research"" answer, here.""Currently, anyone applying to conduct marijuana research has to jump through all kinds of legal hoops that other medical researchers do not have to, which wastes an enormous amount of time and effort. Would you support removing all unreasonable barriers to medical marijuana research that still exist? Would you support changing the application process for doctors wanted to conduct research so that it is the same process as for any other drug undergoing study?"" Free the accountants!This is only going to become a bigger and bigger issue, as more states legalize marijuana.""Marijuana businesses that are fully in compliance with their state's laws still cannot use banking services that any other business is able to. Bankers are afraid they'll be charged as accessories to drug trafficking, so they refuse to do business with marijuana companies. Would you support changing federal law so that it is clear that banks will not have to worry about criminal charges for conducting business with marijuana companies that follow state law? Also, would you support changing federal tax law so that marijuana businesses could deduct the common business expenses that every other business is allowed to write off on their taxes?"" Free the prisoners!Obama got this ball rolling, but a lot more needs to be done.""President Obama has been pardoning or commuting long jail terms for people sentenced under the worst of the War On Drugs 'lock them all up' laws. Would you continue these amnesty efforts, to give relief to prisoners who are serving sentences that they likely would not receive today?""Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

The Gallipoli campaign in westernmost Anatolia was an attempt to seize the Turkish forts along ""the narrows,"" the narrowest portion of the Dardanelles, in order to clear the minefields and open up the way for British and French naval units to sail up the Turkish Straits and besiege the Ottoman capital of Constantinople. The ground force was made up of a combination of British and French units, with the British contingent drawing heavily from Australian and New Zealand troops. The latter, dubbed the ANZACS, an abbreviation of Australian New Zealand Army Corps, would suffer enormous casualties during the roughly nine month long campaign. The effort ultimately failed and the Allied troops were withdrawn. The Caucasus campaign saw Russian forces make slow but steady gains in eastern Anatolia. Harsh winters, the absence of roads and the rugged terrain made for slow progress. Nonetheless, Russian troops made significant advances and were on the verge of penetrating into northern Mesopotamia and central Anatolia before the Russian Revolution led to the collapse of Russian forces on the Caucasus Front. As a result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed between the Bolshevik government in Moscow and the Central Powers, Russia, it was not yet the USSR, returned all of its Anatolian conquests, as well as territory seized in the earlier Russian-Turkish war of 1877. It was the Sinai, a theater manned largely by British and Empire forces, which would prove to be the decisive theater in the Allied conflict with the Ottoman Empire. Between 1916 and 1918, British forces would successfully march up the eastern flank of the Mediterranean, reestablishing European control of Jerusalem for the first time since the eleventh century, and reaching all the way to Damascus before the Armistice of Mudros on October 31, 1918, brought an end to the hostilities. In the process, it would pave the way for the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and its subsequent division between Great Britain and France.The initial Allied strategy had been to simply knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war. The Gallipoli campaign was seen as the fastest way of doing that. When that campaign failed, an advance through the Sinai and Palestine was seen as the next best alternative. An Ottoman surrender would have opened up the Turkish Straits to Allied shipping, allowed the shipment of critical military supplies to the Russian Army and allowed Russia to deploy more troops on the Eastern Front. In turn, more Allied pressure in the East would force Germany to redeploy more troops there from the Western Front, relieving the pressure on Allied forces in France. It was on the Western Front, the Allies believed, that the ultimate outcome of the world war would be decided. The Sinai camapign. Image courtesy of nzhistory.netThe strategy of the Ottoman Empire and their German allies was essentially the reverse. By threatening the Suez Canal and British control of Egypt, the Central Powers believed that Great Britain would be forced to deploy more troops in the Sinai. Every soldier deployed in Egypt was one less soldier available for deployment of the Western Front. The Ottoman Minister for War, Enver Pasha, also believed, or at least hoped, the Ottoman successes against British forces would spark a revolt among Muslims in Britain's colonies. Such a revolt would tie down additional British forces, potentially lead to the loss of large areas of the British Empire, including India, and possibly pave the way for Ottoman seizure of the Turkic areas of Central Asia from Russian control. Initially, it was the Sinai where these two competing strategies would be played out. By early 1916, the Ottoman forces in Gaza and the Sinai had been expanded and resupplied and were ready to try again to seize control of the Suez Canal. Following the Allied withdrawal from Gallipoli, both sides had redeployed some of these troops to the Sinai. The Ottoman force was reorganized into the Fourth Army of Syria and Palestine. Its six divisions, organized into the VIII Corps and XII Corps, numbered around 50,000 men. With the railroad line between Berlin and Constantinople now open, ammunition and equipment was reaching, the often times German led, Ottoman troops. The immediate objective was to seize control of the Suez Canal and deny its use to Great Britain and the Allies.To counter the Turkish build up in the Sinai, the British organized the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. They also organized a mounted cavalry force consisting mostly of ANZAC troops redeployed from Gallipoli. In the spring of 1916, the British decided to move their defensive lines forward from the vulnerable canal and deeper into the Sinai. They also continued the extension of a rail line and water pipeline eastward in order to supply the forward positions of British forces. British horse and camel cavalry units were deployed to clear the central trail across Sinai. Approximately 60,000 troops of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), under the command of General A. J. Murray, were stationed in forward positions in the Sinai and along the canal. On April 23, 1916, Ottoman Forces, under the command of German General Kress von Kressenstein, attacked British forces in the town of Katia in the Sinai. The town was the projected terminus of the Sinai Railroad and its accompanying waterline. British forces stationed there were widely dispersed and proved no match for the attacking Ottoman force. After briefly occupying the town, and destroying anything deemed to be of military value, the Ottoman force withdrew eastward.  The Ottoman Camel Corps at BeershebaA combined Turkish-German force again attacked the canal on August 3, 1916, before being repulsed at the Battle of Romani. This time, the EEF pursued the retreating Ottoman force eastward back toward Palestine; defeating it at the battle of Magdhaba in December 1916, and the Battle of Rafa in January 1917. These victories resulted in the recapture of substantial Egyptian territory in the Sinai, but were followed by two successive EEF defeats at the hands of the Ottoman forces in the First and Second Battle of Gaza, in March and April 1917, at the Egyptian-Ottoman frontier."

We are the music of your life."" -Mr. Holland's Opus""The only thing new in the world is the history you do not know."" -President Harry TrumanMy career as a businessman happened because two history teachers at Covington Catholic High School, Timothy Banker and Joe Hackett, stepped up nearly 40 years ago and became the Mr. Holland's in my life. They took a bad student and gave him the enthusiasm to dream big dreams and make the effort to achieve them. Those great teachers taught me to love the study of history. You can go back somewhere in history and find someone, somewhere, who has been in a similar situation to what you see now. With a little imagination and creative thinking, you can learn from what happened in the past, and apply that knowledge to create a future. Telling me that you don't like history is like telling me that you don't like sunshine or the Kentucky Wildcats basketball team. I intellectually know that people can get there, but I really don't know understand why. Thus, I was stunned when Kentucky's Lt. Governor Jenean Hampton told the Eastern Kentucky University Progress (a paper that I wrote for from 1978 to 1980) that, ""I would be looking for degrees that would land a job. I would not be studying history.""As an entrepreneur who has created several Kentucky businesses and hired hundreds of Kentuckians over the past 34 years, my question to Lt. Governor Hampton is: What kind of job do you want them to land? One where a person can be immediately hired or a career where they can adapt in the future? McDonald's is a place where a person can be immediately hired. However, the odds of a McDonald's employee owning a McDonald's franchise are small, and the odds of a McDonald's employee becoming President of the McDonald's corporation are about the same as hitting the Powerball jackpot. Using tax dollars and resources to train students for careers as fast food workers is a good deal for McDonald's. It gives the new employee some immediate income. What it does not give the employee is a future. They have no ability to adapt if technology, legislation, world economics or changing eating habits eliminates the concept of fast food employees altogether. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out where the world is going next and books like Rise of the Robots or The Lights in the Tunnel (both by Martin Ford) come back to the same conclusion: Don't get stuck in a one particular type of job or career. All can be eliminated or downgraded in a rapidly shifting world. It's not just about factory jobs that are being moved to China to Mexico. What Ford and others graphically point out is that the highest profit is in eliminating high-paying jobs. I don't think many car insurance agents planned on being pushed out by a Gekko. Or that radiologists may be replaced by computers. But it is happening and happening rapidly. I would rather be teaching young people how to study history than to master a trade that may not be around in years ahead. Lt. Governor Hampton and Governor Matt Bevin are the only Kentucky Governor or Lt. Governor in my adult lifetime I have never met. I was active in Kentucky politics and state journalism for decades and wrote a book about a previous Governor. A few years ago my interests shifted, but when the state's second highest official starts going after the study of history, it may be time to start getting interested in Kentucky government again. Attacking the study of history is like attacking part of my family. It's part of who I am and has allowed me to be successful in business and as a writer. Also if you read my new book, Brand New Man: My Weight Loss Journey (RRP International Publishing), you will see how the study of history helped me lose over 100 pounds. Understanding history is the key to everything. http://www.mattbevin.com/jenean/Although I never met Lt. Governor Hampton, we come from similar backgrounds. Hampton and I are a year apart in age and our parents each divorced when we were around age seven. We both grew up in urban areas, loved to use the public library, and were fascinated by NASA and the space program. Her mother cleaned houses and my mother (and grandmother) worked in a potato chip factory. Mom worked her way through school and became a nurse later in life. Hampton and I each worked our way through public universities without help from our families and got some grants and scholarships along the way. I got a fellowship to get my first Master's degree at Vanderbilt, and she got an MBA from the University of Rochester. So why is it that I love history and she doesn't? Probably because our careers branched from the high school studies we were passionate about. Passion is what truly fuels education and my personal belief is that people should study what they are passionate about.Hampton's career focused on computers, the military and the corrugated packaging industry. My study of liberal arts gave me the worldview to be successful in finance and in creating businesses. I have nothing against computer science people or military veterans. I've had several of them work for me and do very good work. But if you look at the top business or political leaders of the United States, most of them did not have a ""technical"" or ""job ready"" major. And the best ones understand history. Any list of our greatest presidents will include people like Theodore Roosevelt, who was a true history scholar, and some of the most successful leaders in technology like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are history buffs as well. Historian Ken Burns said,In the late 1970s, a top executive at a large telecommunications company lamented to me that business schools were producing MBA graduates who had no knowledge of the humanities. He worried that they were a bunch of automatons. He said, 'I can teach these people business skills, but I can't teach them ethics, history, or art.'If the study of history is good enough for Theodore Roosevelt and Mark Zuckerberg, it is good enough for me too. And also good enough for the people of Kentucky. Don McNay, ChFC, MSFS, CLU, CSSC is a financial expert, journalist and author of eight best-selling books.

Reportedly, this is not the first time that the Islamic Republic has been attempting to infiltrate the online infrastructure (from the US banking systems, New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, AT&T Inc., to the dam, among others) and inflict significant damages on Americans. Iranian leaders have skillfully and shrewdly found new methods to inflict significant harms on the ""enemy"" and its citizens, on their soil and without the physical need to utilize the Islamic Revolutionary Forces (IRGC). The speedy advancement of Iran's cyber program is crucial, as it only began few years ago. The Islamic Republic began heavily investing on its social media, Internet and cyber welfare capabilities after the protests which erupted in the 2009 contested election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Iranian leaders became cognizant of the significance of social media in galvanizing people and advancing political interests. Outlets such as Halal Internet, national Internet, mehr (used instead of Youtube), and surveillance programs were increased. Reportedly, Iran obtained advanced surveillance software to monitor the population, mainly from China. The Islamic Republic invested more than $1 billion in cyber infrastructure and technology, as well as recruiting more than 100,000 personnel. Soon after, in 2012, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the establishment of the Supreme Council on Cyberspace in order to form cyber policies. This Council became an indispensable pillar of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Cops and Iran's foreign and domestic policies. Offensive or Defensive? Iran's Cyber Warfare and its ExportationIran's cyber program was designed, from the outset, to be offensive and proactive in nature.Iranian leaders are aware that they would not be successful when it comes to military confrontation with some powerful regional and international nation-states. The alternative to a physical war is a virtual one where it is almost impossible to hold Iranian leaders accountable. As Abdollah Araqi, deputy commander of ground forces in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) pointed out ,according to the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA), ""We have armed ourselves with new tools, because a cyber war is more dangerous than a physical war."" A few years after initiation, Iran's cyber capabilities became the world's fourth biggest cyber army according to an official of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Even Israeli major think tanks acknowledged Iran as a major cyber power. The Israeli-based Institute for National Security Studies stated that ""IRGC clearly makes the country one of the best and most advanced nation when it comes to cyberwarfare. In a case of escalation between Iran and the West, Iran will likely aim to launch a cyber attack against critical infrastructures in the United States and its allies, including energy infrastructure, financial institutions, transportation systems, and other.""In 2013, the United States banking systems were attacked at an unprecedented level. The online banking sites of institutions such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo, and Citigroup were affected. US officials stated that the level of sophistication pointed to the Iranian government. In addition, US intelligence pointed out that the Islamic Republic was behind the ""Shamoon"" virus which targeted computers of Saudi Arabia's Aramco oil corporation. And more recently, last week, the Justice Department indicted seven Iranian citizens for distributed denial of service (""DDoS"") attacks in against 46 companies mainly in the banking and financial sector. Iran also began reportedly exporting its cyber capabilities to its proxies and allies such as the Syrian government in order to suppress the opposition and popular uprising. The Islamic Republic's Objectives and IntentionsFrom Khamenei's perspective, the future of Iran's cyber program is a matter of national security. Iranian leaders can accomplish several objectives by advancing their cyber welfare capabilities. First of all, domestically speaking, IRGC leaders can more easily control the opposition and dissidents. Secondly, as an offensive tool, Iran can advance its ideological, geopolitical, and strategic ambitions by sending a strong message to other nations about their vulnerabilities vis a vis Iran. Tehran can also warn its rivals by inflicting damage on their major state institutions and infrastructures. Finally, Iran needs the advanced cyber program in order to protect its nuclear sites in case of foreign cyber attacks. Finally, Iran's cyber warfare capabilities is advancing at a pace that needs to be addressed adequately by regional and global powers. It has shown that the Islamic Republic will not hesitate to attack rival countries, including the US, through cyber platforms. In the new age of globalization, the Islamic Republic is adapting fast to the modern cyber technology in order to complement its IRGC military prowess in order to achieve its regional hegemonic and ideological ambitions.

Gergel said he could set a trial date at some point in the interest of a speedy trial.""There are victims here,"" Gergel said. ""They have a right to put this behind them.""Roof, who faces 33 federal hate crime and firearms charges, is accused of opening fire during a June 17 Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in a crime that sparked a fierce social debate about race and gun control in the United States.Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson said he understood the Justice Department deliberations on whether to seek the death penalty for Roof had reached the desk of U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who will announce the decision.""This is obviously a very important decision and one that's being taken quite deliberately,"" Richardson said.Roof's attorney, David Bruck, said if the death penalty is ruled out, there would be no need for a trial because Roof would plead guilty.Gergel also had delayed Roof's trial in February at the request of his defense, which needed more time to prepare. The Justice Department also was still considering the death penalty.The Justice Department declined further comment on Tuesday.Some family members of victims and a survivor of the shootings attended Tuesday's hearing but Roof did not.Roof had been linked to white supremacist views and Lynch has said the federal charges against him are based on evidence he targeted his victims because of their race, obstructing their exercise of religion.South Carolina prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Roof when he is scheduled to go on trial for murder on July 11.In a related case, defense attorneys and prosecutors said they could be ready by mid-summer for the trial of Roof's friend, Joseph Meek, charged with concealing knowledge of a crime and lying to an FBI agent after the shooting. A trial date was not set.(Additional reporting by Julia Edwards in Washington; Editing by Letitia Stein and Bill Trott)"

That’s why a Chicago senator is calling for fees for equivalency exams to be waived for homeless youth.Youth homelessness is on the decline in Chicago, but those struggling with the issue face increased risks for sex trafficking, abuse and hunger. To give this demographic the chance to climb out of poverty, Sen. Ira Silverstein (D-Chicago) sponsored legislation that would exempt homeless youth from paying for their GED exams, CBS Chicago reported.The fees usually range from $120 to $150 and would be covered by the school districts.“I think that’s not too much to ask,” Silverstein told the news outlet.There were 1,422 homeless individuals under the age of 18 in Chicago last year, according to last year’s point-in-time count. That was a 13 percent drop from 2014. Other lawmakers have already implemented this cost-saving measure.Last September, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that prohibits the Department of Education and testing companies from charging exam fees to homeless people younger than 25.Granting homeless youth the opportunity to get a diploma helps them expand their job opportunities and also improves the economy on a larger scale.California loses $3.2 billion in contributions from the more than 75 percent of homeless youth who don’t graduate from high school, according to Community Education Partnerships, a group that supports education programs for homeless kids in the Bay Area. ""Homeless youth face impossible barriers that make it difficult to graduate from high school, and yet we make it even more challenging for them to receive a diploma at a later date,"" Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), the author of the California bill, told Edge Media Network. ""This legislation removes the financial obstacle that keeps many homeless youth from earning a diploma, which will help increase their chances of getting a job and contributing to their families and communities."""

And Bernie Sanders is catching up to Hillary Clinton in the national polls, but that won't help him make up his delegate deficit. This is HuffPollster for Friday, April 8, 2016. DONALD TRUMP IS WELL POSITIONED FOR THE COMING WEEKS - HuffPollster: ""New York, which votes on April 19, is the next stop in the Northeast and the biggest prize of all. So far, polls show Trump taking the state by a significant margin….Trump leads in the state [of Pennsylvania] with 39 percent of the vote, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll. Cruz trails him with 30 percent, followed by Kasich with 24 percent….No recent polls have been conducted in the remaining states. But Trump has performed well in other Northeastern states, and delegate rules favor the leader….Despite his Wisconsin loss, it’s not impossible for Trump to win a majority of delegates by the Republican convention — but the odds are building against him."" [HuffPost] It will be difficult for Cruz and Kasich to cause much trouble for Trump in the Northeast - In an email from Josh Putnam, a political scientist at the University of Georgia who runs Frontloading HQ, a blog that tracks the delegate process: ""The opportunity is there for Cruz or Kasich to win some congressional district delegates or even some at-large delegates in New York and Connecticut if they clear the thresholds. The problem is that New York is the most delegate-rich of the remaining April states. It tilts toward Trump so much so -- given the data we have now (which could change) -- that a bad night for Trump in New York would meaning winning two-thirds of the 95 delegates. That advantage alone would certainly help pad his delegate lead and his plurality, but needs to be maximized in the effort to get to 1237. The rest of the region is similar.""Trump’s new target is 40 percent of the popular vote - Nate Silver: ""The threshold Trump needs to win states is increasing considerably faster than the share of the vote he’s getting, which isn’t increasing much at all. Technically, Trump is chasing delegates, not wins, but most of the remaining states award at least some delegates to the statewide winner (and there are still five winner-take-all contests left on the GOP calendar)....While there will continue to be some variance from state to state, Trump is now usually going to have to be in the 40s to win. That’s a problem, because as you can see from the bottom half of the chart, it’s not clear that his performance is improving much at all. (This is also apparent in national polls, where Trump’s share of the vote has grown only to 40 percent from 35 percent before Iowa.)"" [538] YOUNG VOTERS HATE TRUMP - HuffPollster: ""A new NBC News/SurveyMonkey election tracking poll pitting Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton against her two possible Republican rivals finds that young voters lean Democratic regardless of the candidate, but they’re practically allergic to Trump. Against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Clinton wins the vote of 18 to 24-year-olds by just 7 points. Against Trump, her margin rises to 25 points. There’s a similar gap for older millennials, ages 25 to 34, who give Clinton a 19-point edge against Cruz and a 33-point edge against Trump….[I]f these numbers hold, nominating a candidate who is this unpalatable to young voters could create a serious problem for the GOP — and not only in this year’s election. Research suggests that young voters who develop loyalty to one party often stick with it."" [HuffPost] Young voters are more moderate than their older counterparts - Jeff Stein: ""A new study finds that young people are far less ideologically polarized on policy issues than their elders. Even factoring in how voters change as they age, the researchers found that the youngest slice of the American electorate is by far the least divided — giving us reason to at least hope there's an end in sight for entrenched congressional gridlock...Piles of research had already indicated that the youngest generation is much more liberal than its predecessors. But it turns out it's not just that young people are in general more likely to identify as liberal or that young liberals are to the left of older liberals — though both of these phenomena do appear to be true. It turns out young Republicans are also likely to be to the left of older Republicans."" [Vox]SANDERS IS CLOSING IN ON CLINTON NATIONALLY, BUT IT’S PROBABLY TOO LATE - The gap between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in the national polls is the narrowest it’s ever been. According to HuffPost Pollster’s average, Sanders has pulled within 5 percentage points of Clinton, after starting as a virtually unknown candidate who was trailing by more than 50 points a year ago. Two recent polls show Sanders ahead of Clinton by small margins. This is all good news for Sanders, but with many states having already vote, national primary polls are increasingly unhelpful as an indicator of his chances. Even if he catches up to Clinton in the national polls, he still has a delegate deficit that will be very difficult to overcome.AMERICANS DON’T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE ZIKA VIRUS YET - Lauran Neergaard and Emily Swanson: ""[A]bout 4 in 10 say they've heard little to nothing about the mosquito-borne threat. Even among people who've been following the Zika saga at least a little, many aren't sure whether there's a vaccine or treatment — not yet — or if there's any way the virus can spread other than through mosquito bites….The AP-NORC Center poll found that among people who've heard about Zika, 90 percent know mosquitoes can spread it but there are some other key gaps in knowledge: About 1 in 5 couldn't say whether Zika was linked to birth defects. Zika also sometimes spreads through sexual intercourse, but 14 percent wrongly thought it couldn't, and another 29 percent said they didn't know….More than half didn't know if there was a vaccine or treatment for Zika — there is not — or a diagnostic test. There are tests but they're not perfect, and they're being used primarily with pregnant women."" [AP] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Even factoring in how voters change as they age, the researchers found that the youngest slice of the American electorate is by far the least divided — giving us reason to at least hope there's an end in sight for entrenched congressional gridlock...Piles of research had already indicated that the youngest generation is much more liberal than its predecessors. But it turns out it's not just that young people are in general more likely to identify as liberal or that young liberals are to the left of older liberals — though both of these phenomena do appear to be true. It turns out young Republicans are also likely to be to the left of older Republicans."" [Vox]SANDERS IS CLOSING IN ON CLINTON NATIONALLY, BUT IT’S PROBABLY TOO LATE - The gap between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in the national polls is the narrowest it’s ever been. According to HuffPost Pollster’s average, Sanders has pulled within 5 percentage points of Clinton, after starting as a virtually unknown candidate who was trailing by more than 50 points a year ago. Two recent polls show Sanders ahead of Clinton by small margins. This is all good news for Sanders, but with many states having already vote, national primary polls are increasingly unhelpful as an indicator of his chances. Even if he catches up to Clinton in the national polls, he still has a delegate deficit that will be very difficult to overcome.AMERICANS DON’T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE ZIKA VIRUS YET - Lauran Neergaard and Emily Swanson: ""[A]bout 4 in 10 say they've heard little to nothing about the mosquito-borne threat. Even among people who've been following the Zika saga at least a little, many aren't sure whether there's a vaccine or treatment — not yet — or if there's any way the virus can spread other than through mosquito bites….The AP-NORC Center poll found that among people who've heard about Zika, 90 percent know mosquitoes can spread it but there are some other key gaps in knowledge: About 1 in 5 couldn't say whether Zika was linked to birth defects. Zika also sometimes spreads through sexual intercourse, but 14 percent wrongly thought it couldn't, and another 29 percent said they didn't know….More than half didn't know if there was a vaccine or treatment for Zika — there is not — or a diagnostic test. There are tests but they're not perfect, and they're being used primarily with pregnant women."" [AP] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

And it's slowing things down.",2016-04-08,"Jenny Chavira, deputy executive director of the Association of Yale Alumni, left, Peter Salovey, then-provost of Yale University, center, and Don Edwards, past president of the American Boychoir School, attend an alumni dinner at Yale University's Commons dining hall in New Haven, Connecitcut, U.S., on Oct. 6, 2012. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5708088f2e00006400950cd1.jpeg?cache=o0vpRoOLJz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This weekend, the Yale Corporation will continue to deliberate the names of the two new colleges and the potential renaming of Calhoun College and the title master. In contrast to previous presidents who largely directed such significant decisions, University President Peter Salovey has approached the Corporation with a consensus-based attitude, prolonging decision-making.This article originally appeared in the Yale Daily News.It is near midnight on Nov. 12, 2015, and 200 students are marching on University President Peter Salovey’s house in the cold. Advocating for a more diverse and inclusive campus, they present Salovey with a set of demands. Their list includes, among other things, renaming Calhoun College, eliminating the title of master and naming the two new residential colleges after people of color. Just five days later, Salovey responds to campus concerns with a series of initiatives, one inviting the community to listening sessions with the Yale Corporation on naming. But the three issues remained unresolved.For more than seven months, the 17 members of the Yale Corporation, including Salovey, who chairs each of the body’s meetings, have been deliberating whether to rename Calhoun and eliminate the title of master. They have not yet announced a decision. The Corporation has also been debating what to name the two new residential colleges. This decision has not been reached either.In November, student activists demanded that Salovey address these issues within days. But for such unusual and significant items, who makes the actual decision: the president or the Corporation as a whole?To the surprise of former University leaders dating back 60 years, the answer now seems to be the Corporation.Interviews with Corporation members, former University President Richard Levin and various current and former administrators reveal that past presidents did not see the Corporation as a body that could or should make these types of decisions. Rather, they viewed the Corporation as a feedback mechanism that always accepted presidential recommendations — including on nonroutine issues like these three.“The Corporation simply never would have controlled these decisions,” said former University Secretary John Wilkinson ’60 GRD ’63, who served in the position under former University Presidents Bartlett Giamatti and Benno Schmidt in the 1980s. “[Giamatti] would have pulled out his hair and just started screaming if he were just another member of the Corporation on something this big. He would have had a fit.”But Salovey has taken a different approach.He told the News that upon his ascension to the presidency in 2013, Corporation members expressed a desire to become more involved in difficult decisions — a request he says fits his “collaborative leadership style.” As the Corporation prepares to meet this weekend, he said it is impossible to tell exactly when these three issues will be settled, but that the aim is for them to be resolved by the end of the academic year. When making certain far-reaching decisions, he said he sees himself as just another member of the Corporation and would like the body to reach a consensus at its own pace.“For nonroutine decisions that have broad and long-term implications, I think consensus, if it can be reached, is a better approach than simply asking for a vote on the president’s recommendation,” Salovey said. “So rather than the usual process of coming with a specific recommendation and asking the Corporation to endorse it, in the case of the naming of the new colleges, Calhoun College and the title of master, we’ll instead lay out options for them to consider.”In the months that the Yale community has waited for these issues to be resolved, both Harvard and Princeton have decided to eliminate the title of master and settled their own naming debates relatively quickly.And in these months, the implications of Salovey’s consensus-based approach have become clearer: Some praise it for encouraging thoughtfulness and fostering prudence early in his tenure; others lament that the model has prolonged the decision-making process, distributed accountability across the Corporation and inhibited student access to those with power.POWER WITHOUT PRECEDENTIn justifying the Corporation’s control over the three naming issues, Woodbridge Hall administrators often point out that the Corporation named the first residential colleges in the 1930s and that the title of master is included in the University’s bylaws, which can only be altered by the Corporation. To Salovey, the long-term implications of these decisions necessitate extended conversations within the Corporation without the guidance, or restriction, of an overriding administrative recommendation. His aim is for a consensus to emerge.But former University leaders paint a picture of a historically different type of decision-making process for nonroutine issues — one in which Corporation members served as advisers and always followed the recommendations of the president.“It was not about consensus,” Levin said of his relationship with the Corporation. “While there is a healthy relationship between the president and the Corporation, the body is a sounding board for the ideas of the president, dean and officers. They give feedback, but they rarely actually decide the issue.”Levin added that after consulting with individual Corporation members, he would submit recommendations that were virtually never rebuked.Wilkinson and Sam Chauncey ’57 — who served as special assistant to former University President Kingman Brewster between 1963 and 1972 and secretary of the Corporation from 1973 to 1982 — went one step further. According to them, the University presidents under whom they served would have actively controlled the three issues the Corporation is currently deliberating.“Consensus was absolutely never the way it worked,” Chauncey said. “It isn’t like Brewster or Levin or Schmidt or Giamatti would walk in with some background research and say, ‘We have this problem — I don’t know what the hell to do about it so let’s figure it out …’ Trustees are there to receive a recommendation, to talk about it, to make honest criticism and to have a vote.”Granted, the nature of the presidency has evolved over the past few decades. As demonstrated by campus controversies in November, the University sits on a national stage, within which the president can face pressures from both within and without. Still, Salovey said if he were to attend Corporation meetings without recommendations, he would come prepared with broader options for consideration.Chauncey and Wilkinson said the various presidents under whom they served would have made recommendations on Calhoun, master and the residential colleges to which the Corporation would have undoubtedly adhered.“I never saw a recommendation turned down,” Wilkinson said.Chauncey explained that when Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges were named in the early 1960s, then-University President Alfred Whitney Griswold submitted these two names to the Corporation, which readily approved both. On the contrary, Salovey said in February that he submitted roughly two dozen name possibilities for the new colleges to the Corporation for discussion.William Nordhaus ’63 GRD ’73, an economics professor who served as provost from 1986 to 1988 and a vice president from 1991 to 1992, said that during the time he had access to Corporation meetings as a high-ranking officer, presidential recommendations almost always guided the body. In his experience, the president is the chief executive officer of the University and controls major decisions, while the role of the Corporation is to dissect those decisions before approving them.However, this historically unilateral presidential approach prompted disbelief and opposition from current Woodbridge Hall administrators and Corporation members, many of whom said such a model would undermine the Corporation’s role in University governance.Chauncey said that even though the title of master is in the University’s bylaws, Brewster would have publicly announced whether he wanted the title altered and the Corporation would have fallen in line at its next meeting.But Corporation Fellow Charles Goodyear IV ’80, who has served with both Levin and Salovey, argued that the Corporation “owns these [three] decisions.”“That is not the way governance works,” he said. “If the president said we’re naming a college after Adolf Hitler before we met, would the Corporation say he’s a strong president so we agree with him? Absolutely not … The people of the Corporation historically are not shrinking violets, and if they are the ones who had accountability for the decisions, they will own it … We aren’t going to be patsies … I wouldn’t want to be a part of that board.”Still, Wilkinson said during his time, the value of the Corporation stemmed not from its decision-making power, but from its ability and responsibility to ask the president probing questions about his recommendations.Yet this former model of dominant presidential recommendations guiding the University seems to have faded, at least for these three decisions.“It depends on the issue, and [Salovey] is great at this: He loves to listen, and he does that extremely well. If there is a strong view from Corporation members, it is unlikely that [Salovey] is going to stand up and say ‘I am going to do something completely different,’” Goodyear told the News in October.SALOVEY'S MODELUnder Salovey, the Corporation has gained a degree of influence through its increased involvement in nonroutine decisions and the pace at which they are made. Salovey said while he is sensitive to members of the Yale community who would like matters to be settled more quickly, the reverberations of these decisions will be felt for generations and necessitate patience.“In my opinion, a weighty matter before the Corporation is not best decided by simply putting it up to a vote and seeing if there is a majority — I think it’s best decided when there has been a full and thorough vetting of that issue where everyone has been heard, and then, a consensus emerges,” Salovey said.Secretary and Vice President for Student Life Kimberly Goff-Crews and Vice President for Development and Alumni Affairs Joan O’Neill said rather than submit official recommendations on these three issues, Woodbridge Hall is looking to frame the Corporation’s conversations as it works toward a consensus. They explained that Woodbridge Hall administrators are providing the Corporation with background information on the three issues, drawing from listening sessions and surveys presented to the Yale community.Seeking to contextualize this shift in the decision-making process, Salovey said that, for routine issues, Corporation decisions are still directed by recommendations from him and other University administrators and that the Corporation’s jurisdiction over the naming of the two new residential colleges was decided under Levin. In explanation, Levin said he did not attempt to determine the names before retiring and that Corporation members are the stewards of the long-term health of Yale, thereby justifying their involvement.Corporation members — who technically are not authorized to speak publicly on Corporation matters — agreed that Salovey has emphasized collaboration.“Salovey is, I don’t want to say a consensus builder because that suggests a kind of softness — not at all — but he really wants an opportunity for people to weigh in,” Senior Fellow of the Corporation Margaret Marshall LAW ’75 said.Salovey, Woodbridge Hall administrators and Corporation members all said it is important to remember that Levin was president for two decades while Salovey is less than three years into the role, which perhaps explains his more inclusive approach.Donna Dubinsky ’77 — who has served on the Corporation since 2006 — said Salovey is more focused on hearing the perspective of the Corporation than Levin was.By the end of his tenure, Goodyear said Levin grew “very confident” and was deeply familiar with the perspectives of various Corporation members.A source who attends all Corporation meetings said by the end of his tenure, Levin became complacent and less focused on obtaining broad alignment. Several individuals interviewed went so far as to say Levin grew “dictatorial” in his approach to the Corporation and faculty-related issues, raising the possibility that Salovey’s style is being judged in a relative, not absolute, context.For now, Goodyear said Salovey appears more focused on collaboration, which may be due in part to his academic background.“He is a consensus guy; he is a psychologist; and he is very adept at [emotional intelligence]. That’s his style, but maybe 20 years from now he’ll come in and say ‘This is what we’re doing,’” Goodyear said. “But I do think [Salovey] is much more likely to canvass the Corporation.”Indeed, Wilkinson said Salovey’s expertise suggests that the Corporation has not seized power from him or that he lacks the courage to make decisions. Rather, it suggests that Salovey is sharing influence willingly, Wilkinson said.Dubinsky said Salovey approaches the Corporation with the mind of a psychologist, while Levin did so through the lens of an economist, enabling Levin to identify tradeoffs and constraints and guide the University through particularly difficult periods. She added that Salovey’s collaborative style fits Yale’s current needs and that the University is fortunate to have “the right guy at the right time.”In choosing a president to replace Levin, the Corporation chose Salovey, a world-renowned psychologist who had previously served as provost and dean of Yale College.Goodyear, who led the presidential search, said a desire to move away from the characteristics of the Levin era did not factor into the selection process.Yet Salovey said upon his ascension to the presidency, Corporation members expressed a desire to become more involved in addressing complex issues from the start.“Both through a combination of my style and the desire of Corporation members when I interviewed each of them … we are willing to have a more freewheeling discussion in the Corporation room on important issues that might not involve their reacting to specific recommendations,” Salovey said.As chair of Corporation meetings, Salovey said he has and will continue to express his opinions on current naming issues. And interviews with Corporation members suggest his opinions do carry significant weight because he is the president of the University. But there is an important distinction between Salovey sharing his point of view with the Corporation and submitting a recommendation for the body to ultimately abide by. And even Salovey emphasized that, for unusual matters, while he is not afraid of making recommendations, it is not his prerogative to dictate what the body decides or to formulate a timeline for the Corporation’s decision-making.“As president of the University, I can organize the discussion; I can provide materials in advance; I can express an opinion,” Salovey said. “But I think it would be a mistake to push for answers before the group is ready.”MORE TIME, LESS ACCOUNTABILITYThis year has been the first real test of Salovey’s leadership style. The naming of the two new residential colleges, the potential renaming of Calhoun and the potential elimination of the title of master are arguably the most far-reaching and complex decisions Salovey has faced since assuming the presidency.“I have been on the Corporation for 10 years, and very few things we have grappled with have been at this level,” Dubinsky said.The Corporation’s increased influence over these major decisions has had sizable consequences. It is unclear to the Yale community who is to be held accountable on these issues, several former administrators and students said. Meanwhile, as the Corporation’s official agenda has grown in scope, the frequency with which the body meets has not increased — inevitably slowing decision-making.Goodyear, Chauncey and Wilkinson all said Salovey’s approach has both stalled the process and made it more unpredictable. Even Salovey agreed.“There is no doubt that striving toward a consensus takes more time than simply putting matters up to a vote,” Salovey said. “I’ve been wrong more often than right when I’ve hazarded a guess about when issues will be decided. It is very difficult to predict when [these] issues are going to be decided by them.”Thirty-eight of 40 students surveyed said the University should be moving more quickly to resolve these three issues.“It’s time to put these things to rest,” Jacob Bennett ’16 said.Salovey said that he agrees the naming debates have received much attention — both inside and outside the Corporation — and that the time has come, or will come soon, to “move on.”Unlike ongoing efforts to choose the names and masters of the two new residential colleges, Wilkinson pointed out that Stiles and Morse had both matters settled years before they opened through the influence of administrative recommendations. He also lamented that under Salovey, individuals who are physically detached from campus increasingly control major University decisions.“The consensus model is not going to work very well when you’re talking about a multibillion-dollar Corporation,” Wilkinson said. “Corporations like this need a firm hand and firm leadership. What worries me is that Corporation members, no matter how good they are, are only guests of the University.”In addition, the Corporation only has a small amount of time to discuss naming issues at each meeting. Each board meeting spans just three days, and the body’s confidential agenda includes many items outside of naming issues and the title of master.With the Corporation focusing on these three decisions across several meetings, Nordhaus expressed concern from the outside that the body may be neglecting its more traditional responsibilities.“Someone told me they’re not looking at investments because they’re spending all their time on the new colleges,” Nordhaus said. “I worry about that. Someone told me they’re spending time looking at different schools’ actions, and I worry about that. But I don’t see the agenda.”One high-ranking administrator who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject said University employees expected decisions to be made more efficiently under Salovey because he rose to prominence within Yale, and thus understands the inner workings of the University. Instead, the administrator said, decision-making has slowed not only for these three issues, but also in areas like capital campaign planning and the development of broader University strategy.Chauncey said Salovey’s model of consensus management risks robbing Yale of a true leader by distributing accountability throughout the Corporation, adding that other presidents would not have allowed such an increase in the body’s influence.“Every other president would have resigned by now,” Chancey said. “But if a president doesn’t want to make a mistake, the trustees will keep filling the vacuum … It is my belief that an institution like Yale can only progress if there is someone who is willing to take the responsibility of leadership by making recommendations, including those that might run the risk of getting him or her fired.”Salovey said that while he is willing to risk making errors, Corporation members have made their desire to be involved “quite clear.”Indeed, Goodyear said once these three issues are settled, he expects them to be presented to the Yale community as Corporation decisions instead of presidential decisions. That is not the case for typical issues, he said, which represent the vast majority of decisions and are “owned” by the president and his administration. Senior Advisor to the President Martha Highsmith said examples of issues guided by administrative recommendations include the construction of new buildings, increases in the Yale College term bill, the hiring of an officer and the naming of a professor to an endowed chair.It is, of course, too early to say that decisions made by consensus will be more or less effective than those produced by administrative recommendations, as these three issues are the first to truly test Salovey’s approach. While student memory largely extends only to Salovey’s inauguration, University faculty and administrators are still assessing his style in comparison to past presidents.Wilkinson said one benefit of Salovey’s model is that full discussion and deliberation will prevent “knee-jerk reactions.” He cited the actions of Harvard and Princeton concerning the title of master.Dean of the School of Management Edward Snyder noted that while the recommendation-based approach of previous presidents is commonly accepted in research on boards of governance, a more involved, consensus-based approach is as well.Stephen Schwarzman ’69 — the chairman and CEO of The Blackstone Group who donated $150 million to the University in May — said in his experiences with boards of governance, recommendation-based and consensus-based models each have merit.“In my experience, both can work,” Schwarzman said.PEERS MOVE FASTER"
24,POLITICS,Journalists Cry Foul Over Arizona State House’s New Limits On Access,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arizona-reporters-background-checks_us_5707f619e4b04bf520ff687b,"Reporters need background checks, because apparently you never know.",2016-04-08,"Arizona Republic photographer Nick Oza works from the balcony overlooking the House floor on April 7, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Journalists who cover Arizona’s legislature took a stand Thursday against a new rule limiting their access to the floor of the state House of Representatives. They're accusing the speaker of trying to undermine fearless reporting.The rule requires journalists seeking to enter non-public areas of the state House to first agree to background checks covering their criminal and civil histories, including driving records.Instead of agreeing, 14 reporters and photographers choose Thursday to watch the legislative proceedings from the balcony for public observers, where they shared space with elementary and high school students, according to the Arizona Republic. The lighting is dimmer in the balcony, and there are no desks or other workspaces for reporters, the newspaper noted.Reporters interviewed by several media outlets described access to the House floor as an essential means of communicating with lawmakers. Journalists have been allowed there for decades, they said.Arizona House Speaker David Gowan (R), who instituted the new restrictions, claimed they're aimed at ensuring the safety of lawmakers faced by disruptive protesters. He noted that the rule applies to all non-employees of the state House, the Arizona Capitol Times reported.The speaker conceded there has never been a safety threat from a reporter, but insisted it did not matter.“There had never been an attack on 9/11 either, like that occurred either, before on our shore,” Gowan told the Capitol Times. “But it did.”State House reporters suggested that Gowan is trying to punish critical reporters in general and the Capitol Times’ Hank Stephenson in particular. Earlier this year, Stephenson published a long investigation into Arizona legislators’ use of state funds for travel, which ultimately led to Gowan repaying the state $12,000.The new rule bars individuals from being cleared for admission on the House floor if a background check finds they have committed specific crimes ranging from rape to trespass. Stephenson pleaded guilty to misdemeanor trespassing charges in October 2014, for which he finished paying a fine in April 2015, according to the Republic.Democratic House members, many of whom opposed the rule, drew attention to the fact that Gowan has allowed individual lawmakers to carry concealed guns on the House floor.But state Rep. Kelly Townsend (R) said the right to be armed is also a matter of upholding lawmakers’ safety, the Republic reported. ""As a woman, I'm comforted by the fact our members can carry a weapon here,"" she said.David Bodney, a local media attorney, is representing the Republic, Capitol Times and Associated Press in talks with the House over the new rule.“There has to be a rational basis for a new policy, and then the new policy should be narrowly tailored or at least fairly tailored to address that basis,” Bodney told the Republic.Meanwhile, reporters remain free to move around the floor of the Arizona state Senate without having to pass a background check, the local PBS affiliate, Cronkite News, reported. The outlet noted that some reporters who might not otherwise cover the Senate made a point of going there Thursday afternoon to highlight the contrast between the two chambers."

The below video is her exclusive report, posted to Orange Street News and YouTube on April 2. Lysiak and her publication have since received some negative feedback. On Monday, Hilde's father -- a former journalist at the New York Daily News -- told The Huffington Post that his daughter has received criticism for ""being young and being a girl,"" and her age and her gender were the subject of more than a few disgruntled YouTube comments. For her part, the young reporter responded to critics in a video on YouTube and wrote a powerful -- and rather badass -- essay for The Guardian on Wednesday.In the essay, she explained how she managed to break the story, and also had some choice words for anyone who doesn't take her, and her reporting, seriously. ""People told me I should stick to tea parties and playing with dolls,"" she wrote. ""Maybe that’s what the 'professionals' were doing while I was working the scene, because they sure weren’t there.""The exceptional pre-teen had much to say about the confines of being labeled as ""cute."" My parents and I have also been warned that covering this story meant my reporting was no longer “cute”.

Jeremy Durham (R) is accused of sexually harassing women in the statehouse.,2016-04-08,The Tennessee attorney general's investigation found that state Rep. Jeremy Durham (R) engaged in inappropriate physical conduct toward women.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_127_2388_1233%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The head of the Tennessee legislature is banishing one of the members, state Rep. Jeremy Durham (R), after a state investigation found that he engaged in inappropriate physical conduct with government staffers and ""may pose a continuing risk to unsuspecting women."" State House Speaker Beth Harwell (R) has ordered Durham to move out of his current office to a building across the street, which is farther away from lawmakers, lobbyists and interns -- including the people he allegedly harassed -- but still not entirely isolated.He will also have his access to other legislative areas restricted, and he's barred from any contact with legislative staff or interns -- other than his assistant -- that is not directly related to official business. A source in state government told The Huffington Post that the actions were extremely unusual, and they couldn't remember anything similar happening in recent years. The decision came in response to an investigation by Attorney General Herbert Slatery (R), whose office interviewed 34 current and former lawmakers, lobbyists, staffers and interns.According to The Tennessean, Slatery concluded that Durham used his position of power to obtain women's personal contact information under the guise of legislative business. He also ""made inappropriate comments of a sexual nature or engaged in inappropriate physical contact with some women"" and ""attempted to meet the women alone,"" the investigation revealed.The attorney general's findings aren't entirely new, but rather official confirmation of what people have been talking about for months.In January, The Tennessean also reported that three women who worked at the statehouse said they had received inappropriate text messages from Durham in which he asked to meet up with them and for them to send him pictures. Durham told the paper he didn't remember sending the messages.On Jan. 24, Durham resigned his leadership position as state House majority whip. A few days later, Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey (R) called on the House to remove Durham, revealing that Durham also had an affair with another lawmaker. ""Honestly we don’t want the press lynching anybody,"" Ramsey said. ""But the press didn’t force somebody to send text messages after midnight asking for pictures. The press didn’t force somebody to have an affair with another state rep and force them to resign. So on and on and on. I think the evidence is there for this to happen. It’s such a huge distraction.""Harwell, the speaker, and the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party have also called on Durham to resign from the legislature.In 2014, his colleagues also questioned his decision to be a character reference for a youth pastor who admitted to statutory rape and possessing child pornography. The state House could vote to expel Durham, as some women in the state are demanding. This week, about a dozen women blocked Harwell's office and protested the fact that Durham remained in his seat. They then went to Durham's office and left signs that said ""resign"" on his floor. ""Although I fully support freedom of speech, I’m disappointed that these young liberals would turn a serious matter into political grandstanding and minimize the weight of this important issue for those who have truly been harassed in the workplace,"" Durham told WKRN-TV in Nashville in response to the protest. ""I realize we live in a politically correct society, but making a false accusation when there was never even a complaint filed is extremely unfair.""Durham's attorney, Bill Harbison, told The Tennessean the attorney general's investigation was also ""unfair.""""We find it surprising and unfair, frankly, that a report would be released without our having had any opportunity to know what was being investigated or what was being discussed,"" he said. Last week, Durham said he will run for re-election and is dedicated to making ""conservative voices"" heard in Nashville. Durham is expected to face significant opposition for his seat, including from within his own party."

Sanders, by contrast, has more respect for the conventions of international law. He told the paper that he would maintain the existing deals as he sought to replace them.""They should be renegotiated,"" Sanders told the Inquirer. ""We have an agreement, legally we have agreement. But they should be renegotiated.""That means that any official benefits from Sanders' opposition to these trade pacts would take years to be realized, even if he succeeds in being reelected and achieves his negotiation goals. But often the U.S. interpretation of trade pacts has significant implications -- regardless of what the letter of the international law may read. For years, President Bill Clinton's administration insisted that an AIDS relief proposal from South African President Nelson Mandela violated WTO treaties. Although Clinton did not bring a formal WTO challenge against Mandela, his position was enough to prevent Mandela from providing relief, and cowed many other countries against providing low-cost generic versions of prescription drugs that were patented in the United States. When Clinton eventually backed down, however, the international market for cheap AIDS and HIV medication exploded. His interpretation of the WTO is now considered to be totally discredited. (Clinton himself has renounced his actions in the case, and used the Clinton Foundation to provide AIDS and HIV care around the world.)In his interview with the Inquirer, Sanders is suggesting that, at least for the first few years of a potential Sanders presidency, he would limit his influence over trade policy to this kind of international signaling, rather than overt violations of existing pacts."

Democratic senators have not been able to secure a vote on Garland.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5707fcc5150000ee010b463a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats have a quandary when it comes to their battle to get the Senate to vote on a Supreme Court nominee: How hard should they push, and what, really, can they do?Party legislators have offered up weeks of outraged floor speeches and dramatic media events in front of the high court, shifting public opinion their way, but Republicans have barely budged. Just two of them have agreed that President Barack Obama's selection to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Merrick Garland, should get hearings. Only about a dozen even want to meet the judge.While Democrats have relentlessly targeted Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who faces re-election this year, the infamously stubborn Iowan took to the Senate floor Thursday to declare the pressure a complete failure.“You can almost hear the ruby slippers on the other side clicking while they wish this narrative they describe about us on this side of the aisle were true,” he said. “The fact is -- the pressure they have applied thus far has had no impact on this senator's principled position.” That leaves Democrats facing an interesting stalemate. While they're losing their battle to sway Grassley and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) when it comes to a nominee, the party is winning the public relations war -- especially in swing states like Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin, where prognosticators see Democrats' electoral chances improving.In effect, Democrats are in the unusual position of being able to push for one thing they want in the confirmation of Obama's third Supreme Court pick, and, failing that, boost their chances of winning something else they want: control of the United States Senate next year.The question is how to manage that tension, especially on the Garland front. When it comes to getting a vote for the nominee, legislators are mostly stuck with a grab bag of obscure Senate procedures that stand very little chance of success, and which few people -- including the lawmakers themselves -- really understand.""I don’t have any idea how we do it procedurally. I don't know how you do any of that, I just think Republicans should do their job on it, period,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).The truth is Democrats don't really have a lot of options if Grassley doesn't hold hearings and McConnell doesn't call a vote.They can try to offer motions to bring up a privileged item of business, but it must be agreed to by unanimous consent, something that is essentially impossible given the number of Republicans opposed to Garland’s nomination. Or, they can try an even more obscure tactic of attempting to have a ""morning hour"" of business when motions can be offered.(For more information on the parliamentary procedures, read recent reports from the Congressional Research Service here and here.)Perhaps the likeliest route, and arguably the most effective, would be a discharge motion, which would allow Democrats to bypass the Judiciary Committee. Any senator can put forward the motion that the committee be discharged, but it can only be submitted when the Senate is in “executive business.” Forcing a vote on the discharge resolution would require a simple majority, but on final passage it would need a majority, or 60 senators. Democrats only have 46 votes.At this point, the best Democrats can hope for is some kind of symbolic vote in relation to Garland, and perhaps some fresh headlines. But their poor chances of success show why discharge motions and the other steps are so rarely tried, and why few of the 11 Democrats who spoke to The Huffington Post even knew about the procedures.“I thought discharge petition was a House method,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) “I haven’t thought of that.”Still, many of them said they were getting to the point where they'd be willing to try just about anything.“I think we should do whatever we can to do a vote,” said Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.). “When people are ignoring the Constitution, we should try something.”“I don’t have an opinion on how we do it, I just think we keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing because this matters so much,” Brown said. ""I think we should be looking at all the options we have to try to encourage action,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).But there are potential pitfalls for Democrats if they embark on a campaign of gimmicky votes, or if they try to take a page from Republican senators who have held up unrelated legislation to try and win concessions. Indeed, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has vowed repeatedly that he would not turn his Democrats into an ""obstruct caucus.“Beyond that, Democrats seem to still be searching for a strategy, although they remain intent on trying to keep some sort of pressure on the GOP.“I’m still going to hold out hope that Republicans are willing to have a hearing since no party has ever refused a nominee,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) “My sense is, and I talked with a lot of people at home, that the Constitution never envisioned having a Senate filled with ostriches,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) “So I want to get on with the process.”Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wouldn’t opine on whether Democrats should be more aggressive in forcing a vote, instead offering that the “momentum” is moving in their favor. “More and more Republicans are figuring out that blocking a vote is bad politics, so let’s let that momentum continue for the time being,” he said. One thing is certain: Whether they get a vote or not, Democrats are enjoying the opportunity to keep vulnerable Republicans in the hot seat. “I think at some point it becomes nonsensical not to hold a hearing, and ultimately if Leader McConnell wants to not call the name up after a hearing, that’s on him,” Whitehouse said. “But for him to put Chuck Grassley, at his age, while he’s running, in the hot seat seems like it’s kind of unfair pressure.”"

Tens of thousands of Americans in nearly two dozen states reached the limit at the beginning of the month. ""These totally unnecessary cuts would increase demand on the nation's charitable food system at a time when food banks and other hunger-relief groups are stretched to meet sustained high need,"" Diana Aviv, CEO of Feeding America, a national nonprofit that supports food banks, said Friday. Usually billed as a ""work requirement,"" the limit on benefits was part of the landmark welfare reform law Clinton signed after campaigning for president on the promise to ""end welfare as we know it."" Clinton touted the law's benefits in response to protesters at an event on Thursday. ""They say the welfare reform bill increased poverty,"" Clinton said. ""Then why did we have the largest drop in African-American poverty in history when I was president? The largest in history.""Poverty declined across the board in the years following the law's enactment, thanks in large part to a booming economy. But then poverty rates rose again. And as a result of the law's strictures, a dwindling percentage of poor people now receive welfare benefits.The law primarily addressed Aid to Families with Dependent Children, transforming a federal program that assisted anyone poor enough to qualify into Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, a state-controlled program with limited funds.Benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (informally known as food stamps) remain available to anyone who applies and is poor enough to qualify -- currently about 45 million Americans. The time limit on benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents, roughly 10 percent of the SNAP population, had been waived in recent years because of high unemployment. ""This wasn't the biggest driver of welfare reform. It was a piece of it,"" Ed Bolen, a food assistance expert with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an interview. ""It's a big deal now because TANF has turned out to be far less powerful in reaching people, so SNAP is a bigger program relative to TANF.""Bolen and his colleagues at the Center on Budget, a liberal think tank, have estimated the time limit will end benefits this year for at least 500,000 Americans and as many as 1 million. When Clinton signed the welfare reform bill, in his signing statement he lamented the fact that the bill ""fails to provide Food Stamp support to childless adults who want to work, but cannot find a job or are not given the opportunity to participate in a work program.""The limit is usually called a work requirement because the targeted SNAP recipients can keep their benefit if they spend 20 hours per week participating in ""work activities,"" which can include actual work, job training or volunteering. Since poor people who qualify for SNAP can't always find jobs, and few states provide qualifying ""work activities,"" the work requirement is all but guaranteed to cut people off.Arthur Delaney is a co-host of “So, That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast.

He also expressed reservations about her consistency on policy issues and her ties to oil and gas companies.While Clinton remains more likely to win the nomination as she continues to lead Sanders in delegates, Sanders' string of recent primary and caucus wins have kept his hopes for the nomination alive. The two candidates will next face off in the New York primary on April 19, when 291 delegates will be up for grabs.Ahead of the primary, the tone of the Democratic presidential race has turned ugly in recent days, with Sanders facing criticism for suggesting Clinton is not ""qualified"" to be president because her super PAC is ""taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds"" and she has supported trade deals that harm American workers.Clinton's supporters fired back, citing her long career in public service, and Clinton called Sanders' comments ""a silly thing to say.""On Thursday, when Rose asked him to clarify his remarks and suggested that the line of attack was ""tit for tat,"" Sanders did not retract his statement and would not outright say if Clinton was unqualified, noting instead he was merely responding to reports she was questioning his own qualifications to be president.""She has years of experience. She is extremely intelligent,"" he said. ""You know, I have some experience too. I have a pretty good record in Congress, as a senator, as a mayor. I think I am qualified to be president. And so to answer your question, you're right. We should not get into this tit for tat. We should be debating the issues facing the American people.

""I could have been Anita Hill,"" she said.Quinn, a reporter for The Washington Post, was featured alongside screenwriter Susannah Grant and actress Kerry Washington in a panel discussion at Tina Brown's annual Women in the World Summit about upcoming HBO film ""Confirmation."" The film centers around the Anita Hill controversy, during the 1991 Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings. Hill said Thomas had sexually harassed her years earlier when she was working for him as a law professor. During the panel discussion, Quinn spoke powerfully about her own experience with sexual harassment at the hands of a powerful political figure. When she was a sophomore in college, Quinn's father, who was a general in the U.S. Army and close friends with Barry Goldwater, introduced her to then-Texas Senator John Tower. Quinn said Tower ""showed an interest"" in her studies, and asked to get lunch with him. The day of the lunch, Tower changed the plans to dinner. Although Quinn said going to dinner with Tower made her feel ""a little creepy,"" she obliged and met him that night. Quinn the recounted what happened during that harrowing evening:We went to this French restaurant and he started trying to hold my hand and he was drinking heavily, and I was really upset and really nervous. I didn’t know how to handle it.She said the cab driver sped back to her family's house.""[The cab] pulled up in front of my father’s quarters -- and by this time he was really trying to rip my clothes off and he was on top of me and he was trying to undress himself -- and I was hysterical,"" Quinn said. ""The cab driver pulled to a halt, got out and opened the door and said 'We’re here ma’am.' I had to get back dressed again, ran up to the door and let myself in and never told anybody. Never told anybody for several years.""In 1989, George Bush Sr. nominated Tower to be the Secretary of Defense. Right before the hearings began Quinn said two FBI agents came to her home and asked her about the incident. Quinn refused to confirm that Tower had sexually harassed her. Two years later, Anita Hill was to publicly testify at Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearing and Quinn realized she could've been in the exact same position as Hill. ""All I could think about when I was watching that on television was that could’ve been me,"" Quinn said. ""Because if I had told [those FBI agents] they would’ve subpoenaed me.""Quinn also explained why she so vehemently believes Hill was always telling the truth.""She didn't ask for this. [The FBI] called her and asked her, and she didn’t know to say, 'I’m not going to talk to you about this.' And then she believed them when they said it would be confidential,"" Quinn said. ""Why would she make up a story like this when she thought it would be confidential, and when she never even thought for a second that she would end up in front of a Senate hearing?"" Yes, yes, and more yes. Thank you for telling your story, Sally.

37,POLITICS,Diesel Pollution Is Affecting Dozens of Communities. Will The EPA Act?,Robert Baldwin III,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diesel-polluiton-epa_us_570820b1e4b0885fb50d2a25,Emissions from freight facilities disproportionately affect blacks and Latinos.,2016-04-08,The Los Angeles skyline rich with smog covers one of the biggest ports in America.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570823252e00006400950d09.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Environmental groups are asking Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy to take actions to reduce toxic diesel exhaust pollution near ports, rail yards and highways, which they said disproportionately hurts blacks and Latinos.The Moving Forward Network, a national alliance of more than 40 local and national environmental organizations, urged the EPA administrator in a meeting on Tuesday to create a special committee to identify ways to curb pollution from freight facilities before the Obama administration leaves office. They also asked EPA to encourage zero-emission technology for heavy duty trucks.Environmental activists call the areas around freight facilities “diesel death zones,"" and say minorities are disproportionately affected. The fine particles in emissions from diesel trucks, trains and ships can cause lung diseases, worsen conditions like asthma or bronchitis, and lead to thousands of premature deaths every year. A 2011 National Institutes of Health study found that the number of black and Hispanic people living near 43 harbors was almost double their representation in the overall U.S. population. McCarthy embraced the environmental groups presentation ""as an opportunity to see us as partners,” said Leticia DeCaigny, a community coordinator at the Diesel Health Project in Kansas City, home to the second-largest U.S. rail yard. DeCaigny lost her 8-year-old son to brain cancer in 2007, which she fears was related to the rail yard. She said she has discussed ways to reduce pollution with rail yard management, to no avail. An EPA spokesman said the agency is already taking steps to mitigate the disproportionate impacts of freight facilities on poor and minority communities. Under the Diesel Emission Reduction Act, which allocates millions to emission-reducing projects, the EPA ""prioritizes projects in socially and economically vulnerable areas in its grant competitions,” spokesman Nick Conger told The Huffington Post. “In addition, projects which include community outreach and support, and are sustainable in the future also receive priority.”In Baltimore, for example, Conger said EPA created a port working group that “brought together environmental and community organizations, leaders from state and local governments, port authorities and their private sector business partners"" to advise the federal agency.Some of the activists who met with McCarthy this week said they worry how much she can do in the final months of her job.“I think Gina McCarthy definitely cares about the issues,” said Amy Goldsmith, of Clean Water Action. “I think she wants to figure out what can she do, not just setting up the agency beyond her term, but what can she do now.”Regardless of who's EPA administrator, ""these problems stay here,"" said Mark Lopez, executive director of the East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice in Los Angeles. He recalled being surprised when a doctor issued his 6-month-old daughter an inhaler during a routine checkup. “I asked, 'What is this for? Does she have asthma? Is this because she’s sick?'"" Lopez recounted. ""And they were like, ‘Where y'all live, she’s going to need that.’""The coalition was backed in January by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who asked McCarthy in a letter to take action under existing federal laws to reduce air pollution at ports and freight facilities. Booker cited his experience as mayor of Newark, where low-income families who live near the city's port are ""disproportionately impacted by large volumes of air pollutants."" In February, 17 Democratic House members also sent a letter to McCarthy, asking that her agency do more to address pollution from freight transportation, including support for zero-emissions transportation technology.Goldsmith said McCarthy is well aware of the issues. ""She can’t deny what harm is being done,"" Goldsmith said following Tuesday's meeting. ""It’s just whether she’s going to take action.” "
