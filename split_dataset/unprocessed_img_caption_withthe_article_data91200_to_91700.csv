The Ghost can be piloted by a smartphone without a remote control and only needs one click to take off, return and land. CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 9 and is expected to feature 3,600 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to about 150,000 attendees.

The proposed rules that would lift the ban are not expected to be finalized until late 2016 or early 2017.The U.S. aviation regulatory agency has taken steps recently to streamline approvals, but private sector groups continue to press for further changes.

Rick Scott gestures during a cabinet meeting at the Florida State Fair, in Tampa, Fla.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f376260000350083c3b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) has apparently reached the end of his quest to make state workers and welfare recipients provide urine to prove they're not on drugs. In 2011, Scott sought to impose drug testing on both state workers and poor people applying for benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, better known as ""welfare."" Following lawsuits from a workers' union and civil liberties advocates, federal courts halted both testing initiatives, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit saying no to Scott's final appeals in December. On Monday, the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union announced that it had reached a settlement with Scott's administration over his executive order to randomly drug test tens of thousands of state workers. ""Gov. Scott’s executive order rested on his belief that the state has the authority to require anyone it chooses to submit her bodily fluids for government inspection without reason or suspicion,"" Shalini Goel Agarwal, a staff attorney with the Florida ACLU, said in a written statement. The settlement, if approved by a court, prevents the state from randomly screening workers in 1,133 out of 1,400 types of state government jobs. Testing can proceed for workers in safety-sensitive positions. ""We are pleased that the settlement will allow Florida to protect families by ensuring state employees working in the most critical areas of safety and security remain drug-free,"" a Scott spokesman told the Tallahassee Democrat. Florida will pay the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees $375,000 for its ACLU legal fees, in addition to the nearly $400,000 the Scott administration has spent on its own lawyers. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly suggested the state worker settlement had some bearing on the welfare drug testing case. The two cases are separate. "

So, in true teacher form, we didn't give up.",2015-04-21,2015-04-21-1429641974-2124797-jennifer_aponte1.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-21-1429641974-2124797-jennifer_aponte1-thumb.png," By Jennifer Aponte and Gwendolin BandiAs teacher leaders, we lead not only our classrooms but our profession. Our most recent opportunity to uplift teacher voice and influence change came at the U.S. Department of Education invitation to attend the 2015 International Summit on the Teaching Profession (ISTP). We traveled to Banff, Canada, as part of the official U.S. delegation to participate in an international exchange on our life's work. This year's theme was leadership, teacher recognition and efficacy, and innovation. What better?At Customs, when asked why we were traveling, we said, ""Business."" This unassuming question and the very simple answer were invigorating. They reconfirmed for us that this work is very important and that we are key stakeholders. As current educators, we offer knowledge, insights, and perspectives that other stakeholders do not possess and are critical to ensuring effective educational change. Despite a personal invitation from the U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, both of us were initially intimated by the experts in the room and hesitant to speak up. During the session on innovative technology, one of us screwed up the courage to raise a hand and ask about the role of teacher voice in the creation of the innovative Edusphere idea. Afterwards, a teacher from the Netherlands asked a follow-up question. At the end of the session, this educator walked over and said, ""I did not know we could participate in these sessions. I thought it was just for the experts. When I heard you introduce yourself as a teacher, I felt confident to ask my question."" How odd it is that teachers would be afraid to speak up at a conference centered on the teaching profession.For the rest of the Summit, chief country delegates, secretaries and ministers of education, union leaders, and educational researchers sat at the discussion tables. All other delegates sat around the perimeter of the room or in an overflow room observing the proceedings. As teachers in attendance, we found ourselves in the observer seats. Many policy makers described teachers as crucial components of change and progress. They spoke of empowering teachers with authority and shifting paradigms in the teaching profession. They discussed the idea of a shared vision and distributed leadership. One chief delegate shared, ""Education is the key to productivity, and teachers are the key to better education systems."" As exciting as all this was, where were the teachers in these conversations? Many of us felt that we were invited because we actively lead in our schools, communities, and countries, and we expected to have a similar role at ISTP. We felt stifled in the exchange. At the recent 2015 Teaching and Learning Conference in Washington, D.C., Secretary Duncan said, ""If there's a seat at the table, grab it. If there's no seat at the table, make your own table."" So, in true teacher form, we didn't give up. We set up our own ""digital"" table. We, and many of the other teachers from the different countries, took to Twitter throughout the Summit as a way to engage in the dialog. We created an ad-hoc session to gather the teachers present to discuss our observations and share our experiences. The impromptu teacher meeting was our favorite session. We left there with plans to continue this international teacher dialogue beyond the Summit, and to expand teacher voice at future gatherings.The Summit concluded with each country making three commitments to work on in the next year. After we were denied the opportunity to have a teacher participate in the official Summit sessions, Secretary Duncan invited all U.S. teachers to contribute to our delegation's meeting to decide on these commitments. This move was unprecedented. We are excited about all three U.S. commitments (check out the U.S .commitments here), but especially the commitment dedicated to a National Summit modeled after ISTP. This was a teacher-born idea! The U.S. Department of Education and Secretary Duncan charged the teachers who attended with the task of planning this National Summit. This is our chance to address our concerns about inclusive collaboration. Through this National Summit, we aim to represent all education experts in important discussions about this work, including teachers. This experience showed us the power and importance of teacher voice. We encourage all teachers to continue to make a seat at the table in decision-making at all levels. Nobody knows the experiences of students and classrooms better than the experts who lead in them every day.Jennifer Aponte is a K1 Sheltered English Instruction (SEI) teacher at the David A. Ellis Elementary School in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Gwendolin Bandi is a fourth grade math teacher at the John J. Doran School in Fall River, Massachusetts.

The band was getting ready to play their last show at the Bowery Ballroom and I was invited to witness the final act. A friend recently called Mötley Crüe ""butt rock,"" which he told me was coined by a Seattle grunge guy in the 90s, a term I found particularly apropos. Despite that fact that I wasn't even remotely interested in Mötley Crüe, Rampleman was clearly onto something and so I was all in.Mistress Mars (aka Denise Mercedes) in San Francisco from the photo series Girls Girls Girls, 2007-2014Rampleman brings an omnipresent eye of the observer to the Girls Girls Girls' life cycle. With the diligence of a scientist or a collector, Rampleman marks the group's performances and eccentric activities, like working the tailgate parties of the original band, spanning from 2007 when they first performed until 2014 when they broke up over artistic differences involving Jack Daniels. She also documents the nuances of the individual women in Girls Girls Girls, who have cover lives like superheroes ranging from guitar legend to broker to hair stylist. In Rampleman's video Girls Girls Girls; New Jersey Crüefest Tailgate Party (2012), the women of Girls Girls Girls bounce back-and-forth between roles of legendary bandmates, just like musicians in a non-tribute band. Their bizarre-o world parallels a peculiar moment now inert in music history -- when men got dressed up like sexy ladies with big hair and tight pants and sang some of the most misogynistic songs ever written. Rampleman observes it all, present like an invisible member of the band, the narrator, the holder of the fan space for the rockers and the audience. Though Girls Girls Girls' audience is fewer in number, they are more targeted and more committed, together keeping a vestige alive of a movement whose heyday ended over 25 years ago.Multiple terabytes of footage bring numerous idiosyncrasies to ponder, conceptually and phenomenologically. What is going on with Girls Girls Girls, a band of women who solely perform the songs of one of the most womanizing bands of all time? Off stage, these ladies face blatant sexism, racism, and ageism at every turn and yet they participate in all the above through their reenactments. There's a schizophrenia to the highs and lows the women experience -- from their personal connections to countless strangers through super fandom and their own star quality, to the dismissive rejection by fans who discard their flyers into piles of refuse in parking lots. They endure and subject themselves to the same conversations over and over, just like the same songs over and over. One Girls Girls Girls fan said in a Village Voice article about tribute bands, ""Having young girls cover fuckin' old men is awesome."" But why is that awesome? Rampleman delves into the fuzzy contradictions of Girls Girls Girls in a quite enthralling and, at first glance, subtly feminist exploration under a surface of a behind-the-scenes, reality TV aesthetic. Pittsburgh, PA, Landscape Near RPM's Venue from the photo series Girls Girls Girls, 2008Studying Girls Girls Girls with the eye of an art director and a fan, Rampleman shapes the intricacies, nuanced manners and wow factors of each performer over myriad hours of on-the-road and snapshot footage. Instead of editing the video into feature length-films, Rampleman focuses on a shared passion and repossession of a thankfully bygone moment by those whom the original band idealized and marginalized, finding ownership of a movement that held her gender below a glass ceiling. What does it mean to love something that excludes you? Not unlike other marginalized populations who take on a powerful stance repossessing language, Girls Girls Girls take on the hair metal movement's brags of all the women they went through like sweaty t-shirts tossed after a show by diving deeper into a love of the atmosphere of freedom, limitlessness and forever-youngness that came with that machismo. As an outsider, it's a little bewildering and bizarre to witness that love of the oppressive hair-metal movement, smelling oddly like Stockholm syndrome, but it is clear that all involved wholeheartedly participate, revealing something powerful beyond the underlying ostracizing message of the lyrics. New York, NY, Robin (Vixen Neil) and Patty (Nikita Seis) Watch Tommy Lee of the Original Mötley Crüe DJ at Rebel from the photo series Girls Girls Girls, 2007I found myself out of place, being unfamiliar with the original band, and enthralled by the female performers and their audience at every beat. These women are rock stars. They deliver charisma, armed with an endless ability to slam drinks. The lead singer, Vixen Neil (aka Robin Goodwin,) brings a voice that doesn't quit. The back-up singers dance with more enthusiasm than the original Crüe back up singers; after all they are super fans. The guitarist, Mistress Mars (aka Denise Mercedes), drips in gold and studded necklaces like chains on her motorcycle pants. Mercedes played with The Stimulators at Max's and CBGB's and has been rocking since 1978, a moment many Crüe fans were born. She mesmerized me in the way only a skilled master can. These musicians have decades of rocking and performing under their collective belts. The womanizing men are relegated to relic status as Girls Girls Girls come together to ""pay tribute"" to a rebellious spirit through the most male-chauvinistic band in hair metal history. Maybe that's the ultimate rebellion, rendering misogyny toothless and transformed into girl power.I walked away awed by Girls Girls Girls' commitment and ability to put on a powerful show, but couldn't escape the nagging reality that those songs belittle women and humanity. Through Rampleman's eye, I find a deeper appreciation for what Girls Girls Girls achieve: transforming those demeaning songs into a wearable style, put on to access a boundless spirit and a love of reclaiming a moment. The re-appropriated use of language is the power and magic of it.

Green had been growing in popularity since the early 90s as understanding of environmental issues and needs increased. Blockbuster movies like John Travolta's ""A Civil Action"" and Julia Roberts' ""Erin Brockovich"" helped people realize the consequences of environmental ignorance. Curbside recycling became the norm. And Gore's documentary finally crystallized the notion that human living was making our world unlivable.The economic downturn of 2008 sharpened the call for green as people tightened their belts. Suddenly, what you bought and its impact on the environment got married. Why pay more when ""reduce, reuse, recycle"" cost less? Green was hot, and profitable. Books like Green to Gold told stories of Dupont and 3M making environmental changes to capture tens of millions of dollars in benefits. If you could make a product with fewer toxins, resulting in less regulatory fines, your profits would rise. All companies began marketing green aspects of their products. Wal-Mart opened a sustainability department. Students flooded environmental studies classrooms. The green promise seemed endless.What happened?Unlike global warming, green began to cool off. It became over-used and over-done. It became politicized, with more extreme views polarizing and blurring the issues. People got tired of false and confusing claims. They became color-wary. How was it possible that every unearthly gesture would raise the temperature? Could every product bought really determine the planet's future? ""Green"" - so recently a rising star, lost its luster.So, what now?Market research by Mintel and Nielsen actually tells us that the green ethos is alive and well. It has a younger, more Millennial face to it, but it still exists and is a regular determinant of people's buying decisions. More than 50% of consumers surveyed in 2014 want products that are good for society and the environment. They want products that recycle materials, that are made with renewable energy, and that contaminate our waters less. What they don't want is green hype.How do we soften the mantra as we move into a more socially responsible future? Does environmental good need to refresh its brand, image and credibility?

One might want to cite the directors' age as a factor why these helmers of such classics as Padre Padrone (1977) and Good Morning Babylon (1987) have produced a film with such enervated pacing, lackluster staging, and listless editing, but just back in 2012, they gave us the stellar Cesar Must Die.

The chap finds such a stone, and not knowing the whole village is in on the joke, believes he is imperceptible to the human eye, and accordingly goes about town stealing coins, breaking wares, and trying to touch a young girl's breasts. He's in ecstasy until he returns home, and his wife, not knowing of the prank, addresses her spouse as if she can see him. Furious, he brutally beats her, banging her against walls, and then sits down at the dinner table, not knowing his wife is about to bash his head in with the rock.

This is a city filled with contemporary art galleries commanding the attention of a broad, educated, and well, wealthy audience.Located in the historic buildings on 5th Ave of the Arts in Downtown Nashville, The Rymer Gallery offers a reprieve from the exhausting urban development encroaching all sides of the city. The glass storefront of the sleek contemporary gallery provides a clear view of the artwork carefully hung and starkly lit on white walls with accompanying white floors and ceiling. In this blank space anything can happen. Curator Herb Williams created a zone of tranquility with Todd Williamson's exhibit No Rhyme or Reason. Colorful, geometric square and rectangle panels transfix the viewer as a group and still each painting commands individual attention. Williamson's style is clear and holds up to the Modernist ideal of formalism inciting an immediate emotional reaction. He exemplifies the power of line and color to dominate the viewer and evoke an altered state. In the triptych, originally shown at the Nashville airport, entitled The Thought, The Place, and The Idea, Williamson presents bands of subdued, monochromatic tones washed across the canvas, the color fading to deep indigo across the bottom of each panel. The title suggests both a subject and concept for each work, but the overall experience of the art is more ethereal. Like words used in a guided meditation, Williamson uses color to provide focus to the viewer but leaves the existential meaning to be resolved by the individual. A common element Williamson includes is a strong centrally placed vertical or horizontal focus to each composition. The color and orientation of these works differ in that the plumb works appear brighter and more energetic while the others seem subdued and restful. This is art to live with, perhaps to greet you at the door or stay where you relax. It is the type of work that commands simultaneous focus and escape. Psychologically, physically and maybe even spiritually Williamson's art triggers your attention and stimulates your imagination. The exhibit at the Rymer gallery provides a selection of Williamson's paintings in various sizes and colors, each a perfect catalyst for a visual meditation. Gazing at the lines, I noticed that at times the edges were rough and the colors blurred. I wondered if these were intentional, mistakes, or happy imperfections. I thoroughly enjoyed allowing my mind to roam and imagine the work being made. Part color theory, part therapy these paintings appeal at visceral level. So I ask you, what do you imagine when you see Todd Williamson's art? Are you relieved, relaxed, thoughtful, worried? Your answer may say more about you than Williamson. Leave a comment; start a discussion.See No Rhyme or Reason at the Rymer Gallery in Nashville through May 2, 2015.

I was negative and complained a lot. I barely slept. I was constantly in fear of looking stupid. The office felt like a black hole. I was stuck.  Now that I'm out on the other side I know that challenge was designed to teach me the most important lesson of my life.,2015-04-20,Overworking business woman suffering from headache,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31f7f2400005000974255.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"True story: I was once part of a toxic team at work. We're talking turf wars, schemes, gossip, passive aggressiveness and dysfunctional leadership. I felt the people I was expected to work closest with were deliberately trying to prove I was incompetent. It sucked!My relationships suffered. I was negative and complained a lot. I barely slept. I cried on Sunday mornings because Monday was near. I was constantly in fear of looking stupid. The office felt like a black hole. I was stuck. The situation wasn't pretty. Here's what I wish I knew then and what I'd tell anyone in a similar situation:1. Everything Will Be OkayI was stuck in that fight or flight response to stress. Everything felt like a threat. All I needed was to hear these words: Everything's going to be okay. I don't deny I felt horrible, but I learned we're all resilient, courageous and strong in ways we don't know yet. I just needed to know I was going to be fine.No matter how bad it gets, no matter how alone, afraid and overwhelmed you feel: It will get better.2. Don't Make It PersonalWait, it's not all about me? The condescending remarks, deliberately renaming meetings so I was excluded, the silent glares were nothing personal. What my colleagues did and said was a reflection of their own perception of reality and had nothing to do with me. Liberating, right? If knew that then, I probably would've spent less time worrying about what other people thought and more time worrying about what I thought of myself. This leads to my next point which feels paradoxical. 3. It Is PersonalWhat I was experiencing was deeply personal. While my co-workers' behavior was nothing to take personally, how I was reacting to it was.The toxic nature of that place was an external reflection of how I felt inside. All the judging, blaming, condescending, criticizing and disengaging was how I treated myself. Perfectionism was strangling the life out of me. I'm not saying take ownership of other peoples' stuff. Heck, no! Put that back. I'm saying when we find ourselves in a toxic space or relationship it has more to do with our relationship with ourselves than changing others. I had to take responsibility for my stuff before anything got better. Change happens when we're brave enough to turn our focus inward. Only when we're in a healthy, positive relationship with ourselves will the world reflect that back at us. Healthy relationships start with healthy limits. 4. Set Healthy Boundaries Uh, a boundary isn't just on a map? Yes, it was that bad. My boss called me on weekends. I accepted assignments when I was beyond my limit. I took three weeks off to be with my mum after she was diagnosed with cancer and worked the whole time. I didn't defend myself (or others) when we were treated disrespectfully. Boundaries? I had none.If I'd believed it was okay to say ""no"" at work, I wouldn't have taken on so much. If I'd stayed true to my values of respect and acceptance, I'd have taken a stand when I was treated with disdain. I probably would have taken a stand for others too.When we communicate our limits clearly we're setting healthy expectations for our interactions with others. We're preventing burn out and resentment too. So, draw those lines. 5. Find SupportI was lucky to have some good friends at work and my fiancé at home. My only problem was asking for help. I felt alone and like no one understood me. Mostly because I complained and blamed others without opening up about how much I was suffering. Asking for help felt like weakness. Sigh. Now, I know reaching out is courageous.Go to Human Resources. Get a coach or a therapist. There's no reason to feel alone and stuck. We're all in this together. Asking for help shows us we care about our own needs and think we matter. 6. Go Play in NatureI wish someone had reminded me to prioritize play time. Maybe they did and I didn't listen...I didn't recognize the connection between my state of mind and time spent outdoors. When I wasn't working I was numbing myself with alcohol, stress eating, complaining and gossiping. Now, time in nature is number one on my self-care repertoire. We're natural beings. Nature is where we come from. When I get outside I feel grounded. My perspective shifts. The forest path takes me back to the basics and to what really matters. The mountain air, the salty ocean breeze... helps everything make sense. So when you feel down and can't take another moment -- go play! Get outside. Hug a tree. Lie on the green grass and just breathe. I know what it's like to wake up somewhere that feels awful and wonder how you got there. Now that I'm out on the other side I know that challenge was designed to teach me the most important lesson of my life. We're filled with courage, compassion and strength. We can look inside to find the change we need. Nature will help us heal. And when we reach out to others and stop taking everything so darn personally, things get better."

(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b30a200000990000855b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James Lapine is one of the great imaginations and interpreters in theater today but not everyone, more specifically Lapine himself, is so sentimental. In the past six months his contributions (Into the Woods, Falsettos, A New Brain) that have already advanced the art form will once again take center stage. However, even with him back at the helm, Lapine is in a balancing act to keep an eye to the future while being thoughtful with glances into his past. ""I feel like, why the fuck am I looking back? That's what I think. Why aren't I looking forward?"" Lapine said with a laugh, the same week that the film adaptation of his 1987 musical with Stephen Sondheim, Into the Woods (now the sixth highest grossing musical movie of all time) was released in the U.S. on Blu-Ray and DVD. This re-imagined take on the show, with a screenplay written by Lapine and directed by Rob Marshall, is now the second version available. The original Broadway production, a fan favorite starring Bernadette Peters, was released on VHS in 1991.As context for readers who appreciate, but may not be as well acquainted with the details of live theater, in addition to the Into the Woods film, chances are they have also seen or heard of Lapine's other projects, as well. He has authored some of the most revered stage works of the last 35 years and partnered with fellow giants, such as Stephen Sondheim and William Finn, to create cherished and critically-celebrated musicals, too (Into The Woods, Passion, Sunday in the Park With George, Falsettos). He also presides over them, ensuring that his vision is executed down to the last detail, serving as director for these and other original productions (Merrily We Roll Along, Golden Child, 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee), as well as several of their revivals. While Lapine has demonstrated fluidity throughout his career, producing a prolific body of work, when examined in totality, however, thematic trends appear. Intentional or not, they represent certain and distinct forms in his vast artistic style. Front and center through the '15/'16 theater season will be his talent as a book writer, librettist, director and collaborator on musicals that uncover universal threads in the difficult but poignant realities of human existence like death, love, uncertainty and disease. Artists dream of having their works resonate as profoundly as Lapine's have. At the same time, it may be a double-edged sword to have the opportunity to revisit and reinterpret them after they've already made such an indelible impression on theater history. Like Seurat (the famed painter and a central figure in one of Lapine's collaborations with Sondheim) taking ""another pass"" at A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Lapine has been revisiting the resonance and relevance of every detailed point in his works that many fans consider close to, if not already, perfect. However, like it or not, Lapine will have a hard time not reincarnating ghosts of the past. In addition to the Into the Woods film it was announced earlier this year that he has paired up with producer and president of Jujamcyn Theaters, Jordan Roth, to revive Lapine's 1992 musical, Falsettos, which he wrote with William Finn. He will also direct A New Brain (also written with Finn) for a five-performance run in the Encores! Off-Center series, which helps to bring new attention to underappreciated works. Also, while his own reinterpretations are taking shape, others are making similar efforts--including a stripped-down version of Into the Woods, produced by the Roundabout Theatre Company, which completed its run earlier this month. That production was rooted in a distinct departure from the standard setting in lush woods. Instead the creative team opted for minimal sets, costumes and instruments to bring out the essence and beauty of the piece. Therefore, the production challenged theatergoers to use their imaginations in exploring the patchwork of fairy tales that Lapine and Sondheim stitched together.""No. I mean it's very flattering to have all these things happen,"" Lapine added. ""But it is weird to kind of be looking back as it were. Personally, the things that I'm more interested in are the new things that I'm doing. On the other hand, I couldn't be more grateful that the things I've done in the past are still of interest and still being revisited, so it's kind of a good time.""However, Lapine went on to add more perspective, not about his individual shows, but a view of his work overall that may further surprise fans: ""I just don't really think of career. I've never been driven by career... Some of the things I've done in my life, I've done to make money because I had to make money... and some things I did just because they were on my mind and they were of interest to me... some of the little plays I wrote."" Lapine's laidback approach is likely a reflection of the fact that he did not set out to be in, nor did he major in theater in college. Therefore, he didn't have an insatiable drive or a vision of who, what and where he had to be in his career by a certain point. Rather, he approached it with love and appreciation, less any strings attached. ""I went into the theater [as] a graphic designer,"" he said. ""I designed a theater magazine that was full of plays and essays about the theater, and then I worked at a theater school,"" he added. ""By osmosis or something, I was learning from reading plays and not being analytical about them, but when I would read them, the joy in me was mostly from imagining them in my head and visualizing them.""Focusing on this background in the visual arts, it's interesting to note how, like many artists' work, his has been influenced by life--specifically the vivid and uniquely identifiable perspective he shares with audiences. ""My impulse of visualizing things [with roots as an artist] is sort of organic,"" he said. ""I just spent countless days and weeks and months with my eye pressed up against a viewfinder [before there were digital cameras]. I was seeing the world in a certain frame and construction and composition... I think visually... so, even when I'm writing a play, I'm envisioning it.""Much like Lapine's viewfinder, his works, as with any other creative material, will change with each interpretation as well as form. Watching something on stage is a very different experience from watching it on film or even from watching the same film in the comfort of one's home. Into the Woods has, for instance, recruited throngs of fans who've enjoyed it through several stage iterations, and now the big screen adaptation. However, it's also interesting to note that given the cult-like appreciation for the original Broadway production (which is now living on via DVD), the film will itself will take on a new life, and possibly be shared between generations both taking away different messages, much as in the case with contemporary Disney and Pixar films. However, with Into the Woods temporarily briefly behind him, Lapine is now focused on how he'll conquer his next major project: reinterpreting Falsettos nearly 25 years later for a very different and culturally-evolved theater-going audience. ""That's a really good question because I don't know,"" Lapine said candidly, ""and it's one I have been thinking a lot about."" A show that questions, and celebrates, what it means to be a family, it proves its thesis through issues that were outside our cultural norm, if not taboo, at the time of its first performance: divorce, homosexuality, religious identity, gay parenthood and HIV/AIDS. As much as we still experience litmus tests like the passion on either side of Indiana's ""religious freedom bill"" that remind us equality for families of every kind is far from being universal, the idea is much more acceptable to many, and at least palatable to others.""I don't think of shows as 'That's the show about that issue, and that's the show about this issue.' I think of shows as [being] about people and how deeply and joyfully we can connect with them,"" Jordan Roth added. ""Yes, [in Falsettos] we experience the story of gay men having children. We experience a story of struggle with AIDS. We experience a story of a man and woman divorcing. We experience a story of Judaism and grappling with Jewish identity... [However], I have been so amazed and moved by the number of people who have said, 'This is my show. This show is me.' It's for all of those different stories that people see themselves in these characters and come to sing about it and laugh about it and cry about it and come out the other side better for it.""Roth is himself among the ranks of fans who identify deeply with Falsettos, having seen it well before he earned his way to recognition as a TONY Award-winning producer. ""It's a show that spoke so profoundly and deeply and directly to me when I saw it as a kid. Its music and characters have stayed with me as my friends growing up... I know that that's true for so many people. We listen to this music, we sing along to these character's lives, and they become our journey mates.""Now experiencing the opportunity to wed his love for the work as an audience member, with his creative talents and professional resources as a producer, Roth undoubtedly sees the show as having deep resonance for today's audiences. ""I think the show was amazingly prophetic to think, so many years ago, [of] putting a new kind of family center stage,"" he said. ""People who are defining for themselves who their family is and what that means. This is now what we're all doing, what marriage equality is about... and so many other ways in which we are all talking about and reflecting on, enjoying the exploration of what it is to be a family. The notion of reconnecting with [the main characters of] Marvin and Trina and Whizzer and Mendel and their collective family is really, really exciting at this moment.""Similarly, Lapine believes that the central story of Falsettos still remains a relevant history lesson today. He points to a screening he saw with his 23-year-old assistant; it was Larry Kramer's famed HIV/AIDS drama, ""The Normal Heart,"" produced by HBO. A ""bright, NYU grad,"" she shocked him after the film by asking, ""Was this really what it was like?""""I thought, 'Wow, it's not been that long,'"" Lapine added. ""It doesn't seem that long to me since I was living through it; it's one of the reasons why I thought Falsettos would be good to bring back. It really does evoke a certain era. Now that we're in same-sex marriage and a lot of these issues, I'm thinking that it shouldn't necessarily be updated. I think it has to be a period piece.""""We'll see..."" He added, ""I don't have an answer because I haven't cracked it yet myself to tell you the truth.""""A New Brain  will be fun to do again because, that one, we never got quite right; so it's always kind of a pleasure to go back and look at it with some wisdom,"" Lapine added in comparison. ""At the time, as authors, Bill [William Finn] and I weren't very engaged in it. Bill's mother was passing away at the time, and he was so distracted. He was so close to his mother, and his mother is a character in it. Of course, it was also about his own mortality because he went through this terrible experience with his brain. I was really not that engaged in it either, and I didn't direct it; so I think, for us, it's kind of fun to go back to something and look at it and wonder, why did we do that? Why don't we try this? It won't be radically reinvented, but I think it will be radically reinterpreted, in a way.""As much as he appreciates Falsettos, Roth also holds Lapine's larger body of work in high regard as a fan and fellow innovator of modern American theater. He added eloquently, ""James is one of our great interpreters of modern culture, of what it is to be a person, what it is to be in a relationship, what it is to be a family."" He said, ""I think that kind of insight and that kind of storytelling will always resonate. It resonates in different ways. It unfolds for us.

As a parent educator, I spend a lot of time thinking about how adults treat children. I preach about kindness and connection. I go on and on about how we have to model the behavior we want to see and practice the self-regulation of our emotions. And here is where I've caught myself behaving badly. I often implore my son; ""Please, practice patience,"" when waiting is necessary from him. Then I snap, ""I'm losing my patience!"" whenever he makes me wait. I want him to move from playtime to mealtime to bedtime with ease (and on my timetable), while I tell him, ""Wait a minute,"" or ""Hang on while I finish this email."" I say, ""Would you just listen to me?"" and ""You're not paying attention!"" But as it turns out, I am the one who is not paying attention.Right, I forgot. One reason I forgot is that, like you, I do too much. Whether or not we work outside the home (in our own backyard, on a playground, or at the office), we are all busting our humps. Self-aware parenting is tough, no matter where you spend your days. Also, small, developing people really are inconvenient. You know that skittish, trapped feeling you get when your children are uncooperative and you're running late? That's certainly worthy of our attention. Recognizing our emotional state requires that we tune in and notice. I will be doing more of that: Paying attention. Noticing.I'll pay attention when  I feel burnt out and need a break. I'll notice the rising elevator of panic in my belly when my 6-year-old pedals his wobbling bike faster and faster. Even though he is totally fine, I will admit that parenting is just plain scary at times. I will pay attention to the way he looks up at me and says, ""I want to hold your hand,""  as he steps out of the car. (He has actually listened to what I have so often requested!)You will pay attention when your daughter falls apart after losing Go Fish. This means that she is too young to be a ""good loser."" You'll skip the lecture and get her laughing as you make a heartfelt promise to lose every other game for the rest of your life.We can observe when our children ask for every toy in the store. We'll offer the warm, firm limit that it's not a toy-buying day, and acknowledge that this is difficult. Wanting and not getting is hard -- even for those of us with mature, adult brains. These all-too-human lessons will be learned in good time, and will be best incorporated as we stay connected and loving -- with ourselves, and our little ones. Both our emotional state and our children's disruptive behavior are saying: ""Please, pay attention.""  We are not managing inconveniences; we are raising human beings.

And yet, as dire as the crisis has been, hope is emerging. The pace of new cases is slowing. The fear of a truly global pandemic has subsided. We are transitioning from emergency response to longer-term recovery - a very welcome sign.As we take stock of the crisis and the toll it has taken, it's also worth noting what went right in our collective responses.

On Saturday April 18, the micro-berg of West Hollywood, celebrating its 30 years of cityhood this year, joins in the art walk mania and flanneur fever, but in a unique manner that enhances its reputation as ""the creative city.""The entire City of West Hollywoodbecomes an interactive gallery with ""100 Walkers"" --100 living works of art walking pre-determined routes through the city. ""100 Walkers,"" the ambitious Dada-ist art piece from artist Richard Kraft, begins at 2pm in the El Tovar parking lot between San Vincente and Robertson. The walkers, all in black, wearing bowler hats and sandwich boards each with a unique image on both front and back will stroll through city, covering every street, remaining silent throughout. ""100 Walkers"" starts at approximately 2pm, with the walkers returning to the El Tovar lot by 5:30.Kraft-a photographer, video, collage and cut-up artist-utilizes a wide range of images from comic and children's books, pop culture, art, and current events on the ""100 Walkers"" sandwich boards; war, resistance, activists and dissidents share bodies with Ubu Roi, rabbits, snippets of classical art, and phrases. The effect is a subversion of advertising, creating cognitive shifts and sensory dissonance as the sandwich boards are seen in passing (they are especially powerful as cars drive by the walkers!)Working out of his Mount Washington studio, the London-born Kraft painstakingly constructed miniature walkers with sandwich boards to plot the participants' positions. One wall of his studio is covered with maps of West Hollywood with each groups' route delineated in colored pen, while his collages cover another. Last month, in March, his full-length book featuring collage and text, Here Comes Kitty: A Comic Opera, was released by Sligo Press. ""100 Walkers"" is by far his most ambitious performance; Walkers, all local volunteers in much smaller groups, have appeared Las Vegas, Death Valley and Los Angeles.The start of ""100 Walkers"" can best be viewed from the overlook in West Hollywood Park or from the parking structure at the West Hollywood Library at 2pm. Once the walkers disperse, they can be seen all over West Hollywood til approximately 5:30pm, particularly along all the main thoroughfares: Sunset, Santa Monica, Melrose, Beverly, San Vicente, Doheny, La Cienega, Crescent Heights and Fairfax. (The man open air cafes along Santa Monica Boulevard, Roberston and Melrose also make for good vantage points to catch walkers as the stroll by!)"

Unquestionably she stands as the likely next Democratic presidential nominee Yet, the question remains: Will Black America turn out in support?",2015-04-20,2015-04-20-1429513248-7012298-HillarySupportBlackfinal.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-20-1429513248-7012298-HillarySupportBlackfinal-thumb.jpg," The fanfare around Hillary Clinton's nomination has been at a fervor for months. Unquestionably she stands as the likely next Democratic presidential nominee, and the first woman to have a legitimate shot at the White House. Yet, the question remains: Will Black America turn out in support? Will she have the same support African Americans gave President Barack Obama in 2008 or even in 2012?According to the article ""Voter Turnout Increases by 5 Million in 2008 Presidential Election"" published by the U.S. Census: About 131 million people reported voting in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, an increase of five million from 2004, according to a new table package released today by the U.S. Census Bureau. The increase included about two million more Black voters... Blacks had the highest turnout rate among 18- to 24-year-old voters -- 55 percent, an eight percent increase from 2004. Looking at voter turnout by race and Hispanic origin, non-Hispanic whites (66 percent) and Blacks (65 percent) had the highest levels in the November 2008 election. ABC polls also noted in 2008, 96 percent of the African Americans that turned out were expected to vote for President Barack Obama. These Black votes came at a low political cost; little if no direct promises to fulfill were made to Black America. The Black votes were simply based on the faith that President Barack Obama's presence in the White House meant more for Black people than any singular legislative action. In general regardless of his lack of stance on the campaign trail, there was a belief amongst African Americans he would have their interest at heart once elected. This type of support allowed now President Obama to focus on many other voting demographic groups during his campaigns. The issues of groups that would require a commitment to policy to sway their vote at election time were addressed directly. Support of gay marriage, a push for a comprehensive immigration reform and a stand on women's rights were all part of a broad platform. Black America will hardly make the same blind commitment to Clinton. As African Americans felt the impact of the last several years, their position on economic inequality, mass incarceration and voter suppression hardened. All of which must be addressed directly if Clinton is to get Black support in the coming election. As stated by veteran political strategist Charles D. Ellison in his recent article on TheRoot.com, Hillary will ""need a solid 90 percent-plus share of the black vote to win. President Obama received 95 percent of it in 2008, 93 percent in 2012."" But it is turnout that will likely play the key role in 2016, once at the voter box as a block Black Americans tend to vote Democratic. Despite people's memory of President Bill Clinton's popularity in the African American community, the black turnout in 1996 for President Bill Clinton's second election, was a low of 53 percent. If this repeats itself in 2016, Hillary will be in for a long night next November. Several questions are left that will directly affect this question of Black voter support for Hillary in the coming election. Namely, will Black celebrities and will Black women give Hillary the same energetic support they gave President Obama? In 2012 Jay Z filmed the below message of support for President Obama's campaign, with the glitz of a music video rather than a political ad. The short video set the internet ablaze, speaking to President Obama's character as a change agent. Despite being filled with little policy substance, it carried the flashiness needed to catapult President Obama forward with Black America's youth. Black celebrities from Will I Am to John Legend filmed music videos of his speeches. The campaigns run by Obama were social media messages targeted at Black America's emotion, rather than a play to their logic through a commitment to policy. Can Clinton do the same? Will her presence stir the same effect emotionally for a Black America drained by the last several recession filled years impact on their communities across the nation? African Americans suffer from unemployment rates that in some cities are as high as 50 percent for working age African American men. In addition, American economic inequality has reached all-time highs, with particularly devastating effects on black communities. The other question is how Black women will respond to Hillary Clinton as the first woman with a legitimate chance to be president. Will gender have a similar impact on their turnout and support in 2016, as race did in the last two elections? In a piece on Ebony.com, a premier black women's magazine's website, titled ""Is Hillary 'Ready' for Black Voters?"", author April Reign wrote: There are a substantial number of fences that ""Hillary for America"" must mend with the Black community if Clinton is to earn Black votes, going back to the contentious primary between her and then-Senator Obama in 2007... Clinton touted herself as the better candidate to win ""hard-working Americans, white Americans,"" all but abandoning her attempts to win the votes of Blacks once then-Senator Obama established himself as a strong contender in 2008... Although she may be found to be the most qualified Democrat in 2016, Hillary Clinton will still have to make amends with the Black community before winning our enthusiastic support and our votes.This amends will likely need to come in the form of a commitment to a policy agenda that focuses on the aforementioned needs, and more, to excite the Democratic black political base. From economics to criminal justice, Black issues that need to be addressed are abundant. The test will be to do so without drawing the ire of the white working class. The Week.com wrote the article ""Why White Women Will Play Kingmaker in 2016."" In it the author details the impact of the white female vote on Clinton's campaign:Democrats can win without white women, but they will win much easier with them, particularly if they swing just a few percent of the vote... In 2014, 58 percent of white women said they'd vote for Clinton in a matchup with named Republicans.But it is Black women, as the head of households that at times haven't voted traditionally, that could decide Hillary's fate in this election. In the 2012 election, due to a number of factors ""Black women were almost nine points more likely to vote than Black men."" The Pew Research Center's analysis of the 2008 election stated:Much of the surge in Black voter participation in 2008 was driven by increased participation among Black women and younger voters. The voter turnout rate among eligible Black female voters increased 5.1 percentage points, from 63.7 percent in 2004 to 68.8 percent in 2008. Overall, among all racial, ethnic and gender groups, Black women had the highest voter turnout rate in November's election -- a first.While this will all play out in the year to come, one thing we do know is that Black America will have to be a focus for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign if she hopes to win the White House in 2016. ------------------------------ Antonio Moore is a Los Angeles based entertainment attorney with several celebrity clients.

He began coming to prominence in the public eye with the incredibly moving photo story about coping with the dementia and subsequent passing of this father; the website for Days With My Father remains one of the most moving works I've seen online, and a book was published in 2010. Sharing the loss of his father, or celebrating the birth of his daughter in his own too-honest way, Toledano is a heart-string-pulling artist who avoids schmaltz and gives his viewers plenty of space to explore their own feelings. In When I was Six, (Dewi Lewis, 2015) he tells the story of his sister's accidental death, using fantastic imagery and family artifacts, reflecting upon and finding a gentle way to share a horrifying moment in his family's history. Toledano is brave enough to confront some of the darker experiences that are inevitable in our lives.All images © Philip Toledano Follow him on Instagram @mrtoledano"

If everyone had access to safe drinking water, a staggering 90 percent of diarrhea deaths could be prevented.",2015-04-20,"An Afghan refugee child collects water from a polluted stream to be used by her father to fix the walls of their mud home on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan, Monday, Feb. 9, 2015.

In Nthalire, a remote, dusty village in Malawi, a school teacher asks the obvious question in a classroom with too many empty desks. People are remarkably resilient in less-than-ideal circumstances, but it is a resiliency focused on getting by rather than reaching one's full potential. The question points to a more fundamental question: ""What can we do without health?""Diarrhea, caused in large part by a lack of safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (collectively known as WASH), is the second leading killer disease in children less than five years old. When it doesn't kill, repeated bouts of diarrhea drain not just fluids but also nutrients, diminishing the ability to grow and learn and develop in a healthy way.Still, as sobering as these facts are, more children are surviving today than ever before, and it's one of development's great success stories. Since 1990, we have cut the number of global child deaths in half, a feat which inspires the world's most famous impatient optimist, Bill Gates, to assert that we can cut that number in half again over the next 15 years.Where we've been -- and where we could potentially go -- is thanks in large part to investment in WASH solutions. WASH continues to be one of the most practical ways we can fulfill our commitment to the world's children. If everyone had access to safe drinking water, a staggering 90 percent of diarrhea deaths could be prevented.Research indicates that programs are most successful when they invest in holistic approaches that integrate prevention solutions, like WASH, with treatment solutions for child health. The inextricable link between WASH and child health is easily understood, but too easily forgotten in the design of funding streams and on-the-ground programs. Thankfully, trends in recent years show that the tide is turning. In 2013, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhea, setting a global standard for integrated efforts that include WASH as a key component and providing an ideal roadmap as experts convene to shape the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ""What can we do without water?"" If anything should guide the development of the SDGs, it is this practical question that arose from a school teacher, shrugging with open palms. Her simple question should remind us that treatment without prevention will never result in thriving communities; that child health outcomes do not hinge upon one ""shiny"" thing but rather a collection of seemingly mundane things, like a cup of clean water, a hand-washing station, a toilet; that resourcefulness in the absence of one of life's most basic needs will only take you so far.Conversations about the best ways to answer her question by integrating WASH and child health should continue. Because diarrheal disease -- and child health more broadly -- are multifaceted issues, many voices deserve a seat at the table. At PATH's DefeatDD initiative, we aim to host a comprehensive and creative conversation, convening different advocacy communities to talk about integrated solutions.

26,ARTS,Cellist Zuill Bailey - On Nico Muhly and Ernest Bloch,"Sean Martinfield, ContributorSan Francisco cultural critic",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cellist-zuill-bailey-on-n_b_7082864.html,"Cellist Zuill Bailey's latest recording, Muhly & Bloch, combines the world premiere recording of Nico Muhly's Cello Concerto with Ernest Bloch's Schelomo and Three Jewish Poems.",2015-04-20,2015-04-16-1429222786-7686991-ZuillBaileyandstudentsinElPaso.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-16-1429222786-7686991-ZuillBaileyandstudentsinElPaso-thumb.jpg,"Cellist Zuill Bailey's latest recording, Muhly & Bloch, combines the world premiere recording of Nico Muhly's Cello Concerto with Ernest Bloch's Schelomo and Three Jewish Poems. Jun Märkl conducted the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra in this live recording taken from concerts held at the Hilbert Circle Theater, Indianapolis. Released by Steinway & Sons, the sound quality goes far beyond the notion of being there. It is more about sharing the artist's chair, being at one with his magnificent 1693 Matteo Gofriller cello, and reacting to the instruments surrounding you. ""It's how my cello sounds when I'm actually playing it,"" said Mr. Bailey. Courtesy of Steinway & Sons""I think this is one of the finest-sounding recordings I've ever heard. The acoustics are so off the charts - the way they've mapped out the orchestra and captured the cello within the fabric of that. The recording really showcases the unique sound my cello has - the bass growl, the soaring top, and the speaking element of the middle. It's one of the great cellos on earth and, being such an early one, it's huge - almost a church bass. That's what gives this cello its unique sound. It was used in the Budapest String Quartet for forty years. I got it at a very unique time in my career, right at the beginning. All of my recordings are on this cello. It has become my voice.""The theme of the entire project can be described as the finding of one's voice - beginning with the two composers. In creating Schelomo - Rhapsodie Hébraïque for Cello and Orchestra, composer Ernest Bloch draws upon Ecclesiastes 1:2-9, intending that the cello be the voice of King Solomon, son of David - caught up in a whirlwind of enlightenment, a holocaust of realization. All is vanity, there is nothing to be gained, nothing changes, nothing satisfies, what was - will be again, and nothing is new under the sun. The orchestra is the omnipresent Divine, the awesome force that knows Solomon's heart and the ponderous weight of his acquiescence.Muhly & Bloch, performed and recorded between January 24-26, 2013, is Zuill Bailey's third collaboration with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra - the ""bookend"" as he calls it to the Dvořák and the Elgar cello concertos. His preparation for this American premiere of Muhly's piece began the preceding November, dovetailing with an isolated and heavy-duty workout on Benjamin Britten's Cello Symphony - also recorded live and performed two weeks later with the North Carolina Symphony Orchestra. Hovering in the air is the vexation of Solomon.""Muhly's music has a very distinct structure. You can feel it going along and you can gauge the direction. But from the page, you don't see it that way. He has built tension in the counting and in the characteristics of the cello part. It's an intense study to try to understand how this works. On the other side, it sounds very natural, very simple. From the artist's standpoint and the presentation standpoint it is by no means simple. It is actually incredibly difficult and incredibly intricate. The difficulty was trying to figure out and to be comfortable and master a new language of a composer who is new to me - finding voices and textures that are new to everyone. Muhly has such a distinctive voice. I kind-of knew what he wanted because he was very explicit in his direction and he knows how to write for the cello. The wonderful part in all of this, is that he was there! How many times do we get to actually ask the person who wrote the music to guide us, as opposed to speculating about it? The goal with this U.S. premiere was to capture lightning in a bottle - and be lucky to have Muhly in attendance."" Zuill Bailey plays for students in El Paso. Courtesy of the artist.""Then it came back to what would be a good pairing for this piece. I've always dreamed a cellist's dream - after I've at least recorded the Dvořák - to record the Schelomo by Bloch. It's one of the great masterpieces of all time. It is underplayed and not prolifically recorded. I've always thought my cello could be the voice of the Schelomo - because the instrument is so masculine, almost Biblical in its colors and in its stature. So, I suggested the Schelomo. They said, 'That's it! That's perfect.' Then they decided to combine it with Bloch's Three Jewish Poems - which is the Indianapolis Symphony by itself. We did the recording and then, the following week, I did the Britten Cello Symphony recording. I was doing crazy repertoire - a brand new piece, along with the Britten, along with the Schelomo. It was quite a few weeks for me.""A week before the Bloch and Muhly events came a trial straight out of the Book of Job. Probably the consequence of zealous over-practicing, something went haywire with the third finger of Zuill's left hand. It went numb and stayed numb throughout the three-day engagement. ""My doctor said it was not a permanent injury, but that I needed to take some time off. I got very scared. It's the first time in my life that I felt my body might not always be with me to play the cello. But I played this concert. I'll never forget the feeling in the Schelomo. I was almost weeping - with every note, I felt that it could be my last. I kept looking down at my hand. The adrenalin was getting me through, but my body was essentially shutting down, saying, 'We need to stop.' I was sad, thinking, 'This is my last moment to express myself through this cello - this gorgeous Hebraic rhapsody.' I was in a spiritual kind of space - of accepting that this could very well be a possibility, this could be the last concert for a long time - or ever. And accepting that I have been so blest to have these opportunities and also terribly sad because I know things do come to an end and not necessarily when you want them to. As human beings, we have hope. But I didn't have a lot of hope that day. I just had a weight - on top of the fact that microphones were everywhere and the pressure was enormous. I didn't want to let anyone down as my body was letting me down. I'll never forget it. A real life moment. It would be the postcard that says, 'Thank you for letting me express myself through the cello of a lifetime.'""And then the numbness passed. During this exchange with Zuill, I admitted to my own shock and awe at the near-Biblical parallels of his challenging adventure and that my renewed acquaintance and passion for the composers he has recorded is due entirely to his consummate artistry. ZUILL BAILEY. Courtesy of the artist.""When people trust an artist or musician - then they will explore other realms. We've talked about Britten, Daugherty, Bach, Brahms, Beethoven - it's all over the map. It's not one cut, where someone makes a career on one type of music. I'm trying to broaden myself. We all do it together. I have my own stories of artists I love - how they championed new pieces. And because of that, I got to know new composers and new sounds. And then, all of a sudden, comes this experience with the Bloch and Muhly - which I'm now sharing with my students. I talk about how life is fragile, how you have to channel what you've got in the time that you can. For me and in many ways, this CD put the picture in a larger perspective. It happened to be the perfect music to do so. I guess that was Fate being kind."""

It was an exhibit that somehow never materialized.Named The Cast Iron Court Corporation (CICC), the building (erected on the site of P.T. Barnum's second American Museum which burned down in 1868) became the live/work home in 1974 of a distinguished group of artists including Nam June Paik and his wife Shigeko Kubota, Ay-O, Yoshi Wada, Simone Forti, Peter Van Riper, Francis Alenikoff, Mary Beth Edelson, Davidson Gigliotti and Elaine Summers. Since it had no columns, the 35-foot wide building was especially attractive to dancers like Forti, Summers, and Alenikoff. Across the internal courtyard, was a twin building, 541 Broadway, the so-called dancers' building, which was home to Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs, and Douglas Dunn.George Maciunas, the founder of the Fluxus art movement and the creative force behind live/work artist coops in SoHo, bought the building for $325,000 but Maciunas never actually lived there; instead, he sold off all of the loft spaces in the building to artists, including his second-floor space which he originally bought for himself but then sold to Jean Dupuy and Olga Adorno. But Maciunas's ties to the building were truly significant: he was severely beaten there by a bunch of thugs who demanded payment on owed bills in 1975, and he was married in the same second-floor Broadway loft, now home to the Emily Harvey Foundation, in February 1978. Sadly, this was only three months before he died. In the Fluxus wedding ceremony, on view at the event, both Maciunas and his bride Billie Hutching wore bridal gowns.Four decades after its transformation into an artist coop, on April 11, a version of Harvey's exhibit finally took place in 537 Broadway/110 Mercer, the work of Columbia University Master's candidate Agustin Schang, with the design assistance of Laura Escobar and the deep knowledge of Kevin Harrison, the building's super for 20 years, a man who collaborated on various Maciunas construction projects including 80 Wooster Street, and a man dubbed by Schang as ""the best Building Historian in-site.""Although Schang (who is 36) was trained as an architect in his native Buenos Aires, he has never worked in a firm. Instead, he was drawn to cultural events, serving first as a technical coordinator for the Festival Internacional de Teatro de Buenos Aires (FIBA), and later as a member of the production team for the Buenos Aires Festival Internacional de Cine Independiente (BAFICI) where his assignment was to contact Jonas Mekas to get one of Mekas's films in the festival. After Mekas's ""Letter to Greenpoint"" was screened, Mekas contacted him about a performance project created by Virginie Marchand, a filmmaker and Butoh dancer, with Mekas as the camera man. Shown in Buenos Aires, and Tokyo, Mekas wanted to bring it to New York in 2007 and he suggested the Emily Harvey Foundation (EHF) space in SoHo. So began, in 2010, Schang's collaboration with Christian Xatrec, EHF's director, with Schang visiting New York to help with programsBy 2013, Schang was restless. He had spent eight years setting up venues for major festivals in Argentina but he knew that ""he needed to do something else."" Back in New York City, he heard about the new M.S. Program in Critical, Curatorial and Conceptual Practices in Architecture at Columbia University (GSAPP), applied and was accepted, and he moved, like a mouse in the attic, into a pied-a-terre perched above the foundation space; his entrance a steep, spiral metal staircase. When it was time to come up with an idea for a thesis, he knew that he wanted a ""cool project, one where architecture somehow connected with curatorial matters, not just with real estate and design; one where he would be involved in mediating different audiences."" He titled his thesis: Toward events, scoring objects, with Ways of treating buildings in order to see them as one component.What inspired the final design of the current project? ""I am the luckiest man in the world to be in this space,"" Schang said, modestly claiming that ""people, stories, archives, and documents"" just ""came to him."" Three documents in particular influenced him: George Brecht's Event Score, an Emily Harvey letter from 1992 proposing an art show in 537 Broadway/110 Mercer, and a 1980s listing of the artists who lived there. Modeled on the Event Score, a conceptual model of artistic practice developed by artist George Brecht, in which objects with simple white cards with few words on them would provide a new way to see subjects and objects, Schang's Ways of treating buildings in order to see them was his riff on Brecht's Ways of treating objects in order to see them (Notebook # 8). Brecht's thinking on the subject significantly influenced the Fluxus Art Movement. Schang's curatorial event was designed to ""understand the particular way the 537 Broadway/110 Mercer people recorded their own history."" It involved taking viewers on a one-hour guided tour from the sub-basement up to the fifth floor. Drawing on extensive research, the exhibit included 27 works, documents, and objects done by the artists who lived in the building. At every stop along the tour, Kevin Harrison added personal details to illuminate the object or the space. In the sub-basement, Harrison explained that the space behind the closed door had once been Black Hole by Ay-O, a ""kind of tactile black-hole, carpeted and totally black."" There were 15 or 20 little objects to feel. Ten or fifteen years ago, the space was sold for studios. Further down the hallway, we stopped to hear a vinyl recording of Off the Wall (1984) by Yoshi Wada, who lived on the third floor. Wada worked with Harrison doing plumbing jobs for Maciunas and his musical creations were written for instruments made out of plumbing parts, although the piece we heard was played on bagpipes. There's a video of Nam June Paik from 1979 on the building elevator shot by Joan Logue, who used to live on the 4th floor with Ay-O. We see the cable that you had to pull to make the elevator go up or down. On the wall, outside of Harrison's office (off-limits for the tour) is a print from 1857 showing the Chinese Museum that used to exist on the site. Nearby is the former den of Citizen Kafka, the stage name of Richard Schulman, a radio personality and folk musician, who had a studio there. An old color photograph shows a red door with letters pasted to it, spelling out the sentence: ""Citizen Kafka iz a wackie man in a cake at a fete."" ""Kafka had a show on WBAI radio with John Goodman,"" Harrison recalled. Down the hall is Charlotte Moorman's Green Neon Cello: Shadow of my Cello, 1989. According to Joan Rothfuss, author of Topless Cellist: The Improbable Life of Charlotte Moorman, Moorman's last public performance in New York City was Child of the Cello, a solo exhibition held in the Emily Harvey Gallery.In Davidson Gigliotti and Elaine Summers's loft space on the fifth floor, there is an Elaine Summers' video, Buttons and Buttonholes that was filmed in four languages (we see the Portuguese version) shot in the very same kitchen space that we see before us and on the 3rd floor, in Frances Alenikoff's space, her daughter Francesca Rheannon said that the space, with the addition of a few walls, has remained the same. Alenikoff was a dancer, choreographer, and visual artist. ""See that squash up there,"" Rheannon said, pointing to a gourd on a shelf, ""she had that in the 1970s."" On a table, are copies of Alenikoff's drawings and her rock paintings. We walk through the door into the dance studio where Meredith Monk and Philip Corner once danced. ""The floor was laid by an Italian craftsman,"" her daughter said, and ""it is known as the best dance floor in New York City. It is very resilient--returns energy to the dancers who use it."" Today, the space is still rented by various dance companies including Movement Research.On the third floor, we hear the Plumbing Music of Peter Van Riper while Drawn on Windows, his video is playing. Slowly, the audience becomes aware that dancer Cathy Weiss is performing. Two cameras artfully placed, record her dancing with her shadow.The hour tour is over and the crowd returns to the Emily Harvey Foundation gallery space on the second floor. It is a mixture of uptown and downtown, old and young. There are architectural students from Columbia, undoubtedly friends and colleagues of Schang's and SoHo residents like Yukie Ohta whose SoHo Memory Project Kickstarter Party is scheduled for May 7th.It is dark outside. In a building across Broadway, a crystal chandelier glows from a loft window. On the streets below, vendors are closing up their carts and shoppers are hurrying home, clutching shopping bags from UNIQLO and H&M in each hand.Upstairs, Agustin Schang is grateful. He has done justice to the building. He has somehow managed to conserve it. He quotes a line that he loves: ""George Brecht said that we have to 'view objects for a long time until they are seen.'""537 Broadway/110 Mercer StreetGreen Neon Cello by Charlotte MoormanCitizen Kafka DisplaySchang on TourProject NewspaperFrancesca RheannonAlenikoff StudioCathy WeissAll photos except building facade by Paula Court"

(Photo by Warner Bros./Delivered by Online USA),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b312240000300097a93a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"According to lore, weekends are a great time for adults to accomplish chores. I, an adult, have often been seduced by this tale, beginning each Sunday with a long list of tasks I intend to complete before abandoning said list by 2 p.m. to watch ""Gilmore Girls."" (Thank you, Netflix.)But with the changing seasons' reminder that time does, in fact, continue to pass -- whether or not I’ve unpacked the bags of housewares my aunt gave me when she moved out of her New Jersey home a month ago -- I set out this past Sunday to attack my to-do list with particular resolve. Bristling with the knowledge that the sooner I complete these basic tasks, the sooner my real life could begin, I pulled on my chores leggings and vowed to start after one real quick episode of ""Gilmore Girls."" Then, I watched eight hours of other people doing stuff, and ate cheese.Mild spoilers for ""Gilmore Girls"" Season 5 and Season 6 below. Hour 1: Season 5, Episode 21: ""Blame Booze and Melville"" What they did: Luke defends his offer on a $$ house $$ in the hopes that one day he and Lorelai, two responsible adults who own their own businesses, will live in and populate it with children financially dependent on them for survival.  What I didn't do: Set up an online banking account to pay two months of overdue credit card bills. Hour 2: Season 5, Episode 22: ""A House Is Not A Home""  What they did: Rory engineers an entire new life plan, dropping out of Yale and moving into her grandparents' pool house to begin a time of self-discovery. What I didn't do: Build the TV stand currently sitting in a box propped against my living room wall. (Rory and Lorelai continue to eat their burgers on my floor.)Hour 3: Season 6, Episode 1: ""New And Improved Lorelai"" What they did: While living with her grandparents, Rory appears for court in an aggressively appropriate outfit, despite the fact that most of her clothing was strewn about Lorelai's house until earlier that day when Emily retrieved it. What I didn't do: Wash my hair for the first time in six days. Hour 4: Season 6, Episode 2: ""Fight Face""  What they did: Rory works to complete her 300-hour community service sentence, picking up trash on the side of the road for many, many hours. What I didn't do: Carry a single bag of trash from kitchen to sidewalk curb.Hour 5: Season 6, Episode 3: ""The UnGraduate"" What they did: When Lorelai's dog Paul Anka gets sick after eating chocolate, Luke takes him to the vet and nurses him back to health.  What I didn't do: Reschedule thrice-cancelled dentist appointment on ZocDoc to maintain actual human health.  What I did do: Buy and consume bar of chocolate.  Hour 6: Season 6, Episode 4: ""Always a Godmother, Never a God""  What they did: Sookie prepares for the baptisms of her two babies, using the occasion to spin a plot to bring Rory and Lorelai back together. What I didn't do: Follow own tiredness cues and go to sleep before physical pain set in.Hour 7: Season 6, Episode 5: ""We've Got Magic To Do""  What they did: In the face of a D.A.R party disaster, Rory takes over planning duties and manages to sell out the now stylishly USO-themed event. What I didn't do: RSVP to friend's birthday party on FB, after second reminder that she needs head count to plan for alcohol.  Hour 8: Season 6, Episode 6: ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" What they did: Rory tells Logan, her functional long-term boyfriend, that she loves him.  What I didn't do: Craft clever text back to dude from party, thus severing all potential for future interaction. In conclusion: I am a grown-up. "

My skull simply fell into pieces on the operating table. I was totally awake during the procedure and I was able to see my brain ooze right out into the open. Being able to perceive the very thing that is doing your perceiving is an experience no one should miss. I'd been addicted to pornography and I'd embarked upon the craniectomy in the hope of getting involved in a loving and committed relationship. In fact after my doctor informed me about the specifics of the operation and I responded 'that sounds like brainwashing,' his response was, 'your brain needs to be washed.' I'd told him about the porn sites I went to. Some were really dirty. So his rub a dub dub approach was spot on. I had to nip my addiction in the bud, before I did any further harm to myself or others and I needed a real hands-on approach. I was tired of the softer and easier path of talk therapy which produced little results. No pain, no gain. A craniectomy is not something that can be done arthroscopically, in the way that orthopedists treat a torn meniscus, since you have to remove the whole crown of the skull which means that the recovery period is going to be much longer. I had tickets for the Bosox game the day after the scheduled surgery and I was sorely disappointed when I was told that I couldn't simply be put together like Humpty Dumpty and then head up to Yankee Stadium on the 4. I was going to have to rest and it would be a while before it was possible to tell if the operation had been a success and the dirty thoughts abolished. If not they could always open me back up and start all over again. Luckily the operation was a total success. I had completely cleaned up my act and before long I returned to school and became an egghead. Not surprisingly neuroscience was my field of interest and I was appointed a tenured professor at a small liberal arts college. I got the wife and kids and a little house with a white picket fence. The scars eventually healed and my hair grew back. Looking at me you'd never suspect that a troubled mind had once inhabited my skull.""photo of Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock in l967 (NBC Television){This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

The incident occurred off the Greek island of Rhodes, and involved a packed boat carrying around 200 migrants, according to police figures.The footage obtained by local news outlet Rodiaki shows a tragic progression of events, as the migrant boat first appears to be caught powerless along the shore before it begins to break into pieces. Later videos depict the horrific aftermath of the crash and the scrambling rescue effort, with migrants handing off young children to those on land while others desperately hold on to the debris of the collapsing ship. The video shot before the crash shows the boat rocking in the waters along the shore of Rhodes:Some time later the migrant boat appears to be dashed apart after it runs aground, with some of the people aboard swimming for the beach:Another video captures the scene along the beach, with migrants clinging to the wreckage of their boat as flotsam is scattered among the waves:The Greek coast guard told Reuters that so far 90 people have been rescued from the wreck, and identified the three dead that have been recovered as ""a man, a woman and a child."" This latest shipwreck comes a day after the one of the deadliest incidents of the recent migrant crisis, in which a ship carrying hundreds of people capsized in the Mediterranean. As many as 700 people are feared dead. As a result of those deaths, European Union leaders will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to re-evaluate Europe's response to the surge of migrants predominantly fleeing conflict and repression in the Middle East and North Africa. If the death toll is confirmed, there will have been more than 1,500 migrant deaths in 2015 from doomed journeys across the Mediterranean, 50 times more than at this point last year, according to The Guardian."

When we do our ""gratitude inventory"" (aka, a way to get them to reflect and pray), they rattle off things as a matter of routine that many people would only dream of.So how do I explain something as alien and complex as a state of being part of the working poor in a way they can have a at least a chance to internalize?This was part of my goal in taking on My Jesus Project, a year-long endeavor to more deeply understand what we mean when we talk about following Jesus: to move from ignorance to empathy, which can only be achieved sometimes through direct, personal experiences.For a month, I was assigned by one of my ""Jesus Mentors"" to go out of my way to walk and/or take public transportation to get places, with the intention that I would come into contact with people I might otherwise miss or overlook. As I did it, I realized my kids could benefit from it as well.The first sign that they needed such an experience was that, when I announced to them we were taking the bus and train to do our family activities one weekend, they were excited. It was a new experience for them, rather than a necessity. As for the mile-long walks to get from place to place when the transit system didn't get us exactly where we were going, they were a little less thrilled with that. And yet, we slowed down more, spent more time talking, and while on the public systems I noticed we looked each other in the eye a lot more, rather than all facing forward (with the kinds inevitably with their faces fixed on a screen) in the car.My son, Mattias, who is on the high end of the autism spectrum, is a keen observer, and I suppose a natural byproduct of that is that he asks questions. A lot of questions.""Dad,"" he said, after jumping off the final leg of the bus route one day, ""why were some of the people sleeping on the bus?""""Different reasons,"" I said. ""I think some of them usually live outside, so riding the bus is actually a lot more comfortable than sleeping in a stairwell or on a park bench. Especially when it's raining."" Because we do serve at a downtown church in Portland, where the number of people living outside is inordinately high, they do come into contact with them on a weekly basis. And yet, it's still hard for them to imagine that these friends of ours really don't have a choice about where to sleep.""So, like, they really don't have anyplace else to go?""""Some of them, yeah,"" I said.""But some of them that were sleeping didn't look homeless at all,"" he said.""Right,"" I said. ""Some of them are going to, or coming home from, work.""""Why don't they just work closer to home so they can get more sleep?""""Lots of people have to take jobs wherever they can get them"" I said. ""Sometimes they can't find good paying jobs where they can also find an affordable place to live. And some of them have to work more than one job.""""What for?"" he asked.""Well,"" I said, ""think about it this way. Say you work full time and you make $500 a week...""""Wow,"" his eyes widened,"" that's a ton of money.""""To you, yeah,"" I said, ""but then remember, if they have kids, they have to pay a babysitter, that might be $150 or more of that. Plus maybe $200 toward rent."" I could see his brain working away.""So they still have $150 left. That's pretty good.""""Except,"" I said, they haven't paid for food yet. That's probably $100 if they have a family. Then there's electricity, water, gas. So figure that's maybe another $75 a week.""""But,"" he scowled, ""that's more than they made already. And what about clothes and medicine and stuff?""""Right,"" I said. So what would they need to do?""""Get another job?""""Probably,"" I said. ""But then they have to pay a babysitter more. And you have to consider that a lot of people who live in more affordable housing also live in a food desert.""""A what?'""A food desert,"" I said, ""means that there aren't healthy choices near your house where you can get good food for your family. So you end up either eating fast food or taking the bus or train even more to get the food you want.""""Which means more babysitting,"" he said.""And more time away from home,"" I said. ""So if someone needs to work another part-time job in addition to their full-time job, that's, say 12 hours a day right there. Plus figure another hour and a half for transportation, grocery shopping, spending at least a little bit of time with their partner or kids...""""No wonder they're tired,"" he said in quiet bewilderment. ""That's just not fair.""It all reminded me of when I worked in a Title 1 school in southern Colorado where the student turnover rate was more than 100 percent per year, mainly because families sometimes would have to move a couple of times during the school year, either because they couldn't make rent, or because the good will of friends or family had worn thin. The reason my company had been brought in was because only fourteen percent of their students were deemed proficient according to state standards, and only two percent met the writing goals. The school was at risk of losing their federal funding, which likely would mean the school would be shut down.In particular, I thought about a beautiful girl, who I'll call Maria. She had been labeled as ""special needs"" by the district, though I wasn't sure why. At least until I spent some time testing her myself. Maria was kind, soft-spoken and plenty bright. But as I went through the first questions of our assessment, her eyes would droop and eventually close all together.""Maria,"" I said, ""Did you not get enough sleep?"" She nodded groggily, and then explained that her mom lived with her fiance who, though made sure they had shelter, was terribly abusive toward her mother. She explained that her mother and he had fought all night after she told him his friends needed to leave and turn off their music at midnight so the kids could sleep.""He yells at her,"" she said, ""a lot. And when he grabs her, he throws her against the wall of my room. And when I went to school, there wasn't anything to eat. I'm sorry mister Christian, but I just can't stay awake.""Mattias is right; sometimes it's just not fair.Join us for more conversation about what it means to follow Jesus at MyJesusProject.com."

In the email, which The Huffington Post obtained, North-American Interfraternity Conference President Pete Smithhisler and National Panhellenic Conference Chairman Jean Mrasek omitted a controversial proposal about campus rape investigations.""We will not be lobbying for or against any specific Congressional proposals on campus sexual assault in April,"" NIC and NPC told HuffPost in a statement Monday. ""However, we expect our conversations to lead us to actively endorse such proposals later in the year when Congress considers reauthorizing the Higher Education Act.""FGRC planned to push a proposal to Congress that colleges should not be able to look into or adjudicate sexual assault cases until the completion of a criminal investigation and trial, according to statements made during a conference call in February and in a January email to student lobbyists. Sexual assault survivors, advocacy groups and undergraduate members of Greek life have widely criticized the proposal. Some fraternity and sorority members drafted a petition -- which has acquired more than 500 signatures -- opposing it.The NIC and NPC said they will work to ""inform Congress about everything our organizations already do to combat sexual violence on campus."" The organizations also said they ""intend to gain a better understanding about how aware policymakers are about sexual violence on campus, and to ask lawmakers for their initial thoughts for how we can solve this important problem.""Fraternities and sorority groups have announced a slew of anti-rape efforts during April, sexual assault awareness month, amid a crackdown on rowdy and illegal behavior among their members. A group of  10 fraternities and sororities announced sexual assault and domestic violence education programs starting at all of their chapters in the fall. The Alpha Delta Pi sorority and Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity launched an  online campaign last week. ADPi also became the first sorority to join a group of fraternities in the Fraternal Health & Safety Initiative to combat sexual violence, binge drinking and hazing. Tammie S. Pinkston, international president of Alpha Delta Pi, told HuffPost their undergraduate members are interested in programs addressing sexual assault because ""women today are much more open and willing to talk about these topics.""Pinkston said two weeks ago she looked forward to ""engaging in the discussion"" about legislative proposals in Congress, but declined to support or disagree with the FGRC proposal to limit sexual assault investigations. She confirmed national sorority and fraternity leaders were participating in conference calls about addressing sexual violence during the upcoming lobbying trip.""When I first read about the proposal in late March, I thought I was reading a satirical piece, to be honest,"" said Allie Bice, an Arizona State University student and a member of Kappa Alpha Theta. ""I didn't think -- especially with the recent controversial events in Greek Life -- the FSPAC and other Greek affiliations would take this kind of initiative.""Bice said having NIC and NPC withdraw their support for the proposal would be a step in the right direction and ""would mean so much"" to undergraduate members. Some sorority and staff members have chosen a quiet route in opting against public forms of protest -- for example, through letter-writing campaigns -- and those involved have declined to speak on the record and asked to keep their school name withheld to avoid punishment from their sorority or fraternity leaders.Megan Haselschwerdt, an Auburn University domestic violence researcher who was a sorority member as an undergraduate, said she couldn't ""quite wrap [her] head around"" why the NPC was on board with the proposal to begin with. ""There is a legitimate critique of how many universities and colleges are handling -- or not handling -- sexual assault, but the answer should not be to remove the university sanction route as an option, or to make it an either/or situation,"" Haselschwerdt said. ""The legal process, in nearly all cases, would not get resolved while the students are still on campus. Even worse is the reality that very few sexual assault cases even make it to court.""Haselschwerdt said she hopes the organizations and FratPAC will do more to get feedback from current Greeks and alumni because ""it is clear that many individuals felt uncomfortable, at the very least, with the proposal.""

They also face increased random screening throughout the workday.Fingerprint-based criminal history checks will be required every two years for airport employees allowed in specially designated security areas until TSA establishes a system for real time criminal history checks, Johnson said in a statement.Access points to the secure areas will also be reduced.Johnson asked for a review of airport worker screening in January after a Delta Air Lines baggage handler was charged with helping another man smuggle 18 handguns onto a flight from Atlanta to New York City, in a scheme that prosecutors said ran for years and also involved assault weapons.""Immediately following the incident in December 2014, TSA increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities,"" Johnson said.After the arrest, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, asked the TSA to require that all airline and airport employees be physically screened every day before work.In January, the Federal Aviation Administration suspended a program that allows its inspectors to skip security checkpoints on the job after one of them was arrested with a firearm in his carry-on bag.

It's why we love the applications that make it better and more efficient. Live events have always drawn huge crowds and they have always been the touchstone of interactivity (see: the Roman Colosseum). Amazon did not create shopping or the idea of cheap aggregation (read: the Amazon Manifesto and the Sears and Roebuck statement of purpose from the 1890s, and finally, I highly recommend studying the Paris Exposition of 1900 and the Chicago World's Fair of 1934 to learn about the possibilities of the IoT). You will be amazed.On to watches -- my subject at hand -- and my admiration for Apple.In February of 2007, Apple took a 30-second spot (long-form video content, if you like, digibabble) on the live broadcast of the Academy Awards and launched the iPhone. If you don't remember it or never saw it -- or experienced it (I need to keep my cred) -- you must. I have used it as a touchstone to understand Apple, but more so to ground me in better understanding the potential for our world.Never do you see a product; not once do they tout the technology; not once do they whack you over the head with the ""magic"". They don't have to. They just told you that Apple was launching a Phone -- an iPhone to be exact -- and you conjured up way more enchantment in your imagination, knowing that it was Apple, than they ever could have by confusing you with digibabble.Now on to the watch.While the pundits pundit and the analysts analyze, and we see earnest hand-wringing over whether or not Apple will be successful, they continue to understand people and behavior and have not launched the iWatch or the iWearable or the iWrist or anything close. It's the plain old Apple Watch -- and all that comes with being a plain old Apple anything -- and you can check out this piece by Matthew Sparkes, Deputy Head of Technology of The Telegraph.I also recommend reading a piece from two years ago by Alexis McCrossen, author of Marking Modern Times: A History of Clocks, Watches, and Other Timekeepers in American Life, called ""Why the iWatch Will Likely Fail""...""The history of wearable technology says that timepieces are better in pockets than on wrists.""Frankly, history records the opposite in terms of pockets and wrists, and I do give credit for the small i's as this is about the category and not Apple in specific and as I suggested. The i's might just be the clue for why this is different.Truth is I love watches as much as I love tech. In fact, the best watches are all about brilliant tech, and if you have ever studied a ""complication"" I'd amend and say beautiful tech.In fact, I had an early ""digital"" watch circa 1976 or so before they became cheap and ubiquitous. They were expensive, clunky but were designed to compete with watch fashion -- which by the way had not yet entered the renaissance it's in today. It was cool. I watched it incessantly -- both because the changing numbers were mesmerizing and also because it was hard to read the red readout.And beautiful tech has always been the tip of the spear for Apple. While everyone else had boring brown boxes, they broke the mold. While everyone else had a screen that was designed for techies, they made it accessible for all, and in a twist of their famous 1984 Lemmings spot, the rest of the industry followed them -- often surpassed them -- but always followed.And that is why I am not obsessed with the success or failure of the Apple Watch. They will -- I'd argue they have -- set in motion a chain of partnerships, developments and creative thinking that will enhance our lives and the future.""Don't waste time arguing about whether or not they supplant Switzerland"" -- as the Wall Street Journal has...read John Biggs' (@johnbiggs) wonderful piece: ""If Switzerland Is Fucked, Then the iWatch Is, Too""Best line: ""To suggest that the iWatch will influence Swiss watch buyers is like saying the market for a fine Bordeaux is affected by the advent of a new flavor of Vitamin Water.""And if you are worried that a whole new slew of behavior -- mostly bad, it would seem from the postings -- will ensue... never fear!!! Read up on the evolution of the pocket watch into the wristwatch (both wearables BTW) and you will find that people way back when had the same fears and still do today -- looking at your watch during a meeting, a personal encounter, social function or the like is considered the height of rudeness. Human behavior marches on....Perhaps we should all refer back to a 1913 Hamilton Watch ad that described their new product as a tool for moral improvement because it leads its owners to form desirable habits of promptness and precision.Imagine how we can morally improve by adding unfettered access to our wrists... I shudder.Or maybe remember that pocket watches made the trains run on time and were the first true democratizers of technology, and that the wrist version was seen as a women's accoutrement until World War I proved its application in making that tragic endeavor more efficient.And then, of course, there is the often referenced role that watches played in ""illicit"" love affairs for all of the obvious reasons, and for all of the same obvious reasons will continue to do so in its latest form as well.Bottom line: Since Walter Dudley gave Queen Elizabeth an ""arm-watch"" in 1571 (imagine if he had known it was really a wearable), the concept has remained the same... information that adds value to our lives is readily available for us to see.And now we have more...I will have one -- I have a Pebble, too -- but I will never ever give up my other watches as well. No doubt I will find a balance and the appropriate place for each and all.At the end of the day, it's all about what we do with it that matters. Our phone behavior is already rude, discourteous and bordering on out-of-control disrespect -- mine too, way too often, nothing new there -- but here is the clue: Listen.Watches are so named as a reminder -- if you don't watch carefully what you do with your time, it will slip away from you."" -- Drew SirtorsMaybe Apple is trying to tell us something and we should listen.What do you think?"
