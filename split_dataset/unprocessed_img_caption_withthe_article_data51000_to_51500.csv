Last month, the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack trended heavily on Twitter in the United States, serving as a forum for black travelers to share experiences of racial discrimination from white Airbnb hosts.

Mike Pence to be its vice presidential candidate on Tuesday.Pence, who served 12 years in Congress before becoming Indiana’s governor in 2013, could help presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump reach out to evangelicals and other members of the Republican establishment who are still skeptical of the business mogul’s candidacy. At a news conference on Saturday, Trump introduced Pence as his running mate and said one of the main reasons he chose him was “party unity.”Even though Trump and Pence share a ticket, it’s not clear they share the same policy views. Pence is an avid defender of the war in Iraq ― something Trump claimed he opposed before the war even started. Pence is also an advocate for free trade, something Trump has also frequently criticized on the campaign trail.In December, Pence also called Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. “offensive and unconstitutional.” After being named Trump’s running mate, however, Pence switched his position and said he supports the plan. Pence has also long attacked reproductive rights and blocked raising both the federal and Indiana minimum wage.Trump did not know Pence well prior to picking him as his running mate, and the rollout of their ticket has been a bit awkward. When Trump’s veep choice leaked out, he reportedly asked his campaign advisers if it was too late to change his mind. At the Saturday press conference held to introduce his running mate, Trump took nearly half an hour to bring Pence onstage and talked mostly about himself.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

In a recently released report by the advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless it was revealed that the numbers of homeless people using New York City shelters each night has reached an all time high. Since Mayor Michael Bloomberg took office eight years ago there has been a 45 percent increase in shelter use with over 39,000 homeless people, including 10,000 homeless families, checking in to city shelters every evening. The group also said that 2009 has turned out to be 'the worst on record for New York City homelessness since the Great Depression.

Officers are urging them to report any outsiders who may be posing as homeless people or anyone engaging in suspicious activity. “The homeless who live down near the river have told tourists and people from out of town that they cannot stay down with them,” Brian Davis, executive director at the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless (NEOCH), told Cleveland Scene. “They have told them they have to move on—not wanting any trouble or making police intervene.” The organization handed out fact sheets to give homeless people an idea of what to look out for and changes in security protocols during the convention. In addition to asking homeless people to report suspicious activity, the flyers alerted them to camping restrictions and information about where to seek out shelter and resources. A man who goes by “Ice,” and lives at the Men’s Shelter, heeded the call to keep Cleveland’s streets safe, according to WKYC.When he saw someone taking pictures underneath the Detriot-Superior Bridge, Ice chased the person away and called in the incident.While some homeless people are willing to get involved, advocates say the increased security measures are wreaking havoc on their efforts.Davis told the news outlet that the NEOCH had to shut down its drop-in center because it wasn’t able to hire additional security, but the shelters will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

4,POLITICS,Mitch McConnell And Paul Ryan Barely Say Anything About Trump In Their RNC Speeches,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-paul-ryan-donald-trump-rnc_us_578ecd5fe4b07c722ebce7fe,"But hey, at least the guy is a Republican.",2016-07-20,Mitch McConnell's speech was long on pillorying Hillary Clinton and short on celebrating Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578ecd9e190000d1038a7226.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Mitch McConnell took the stage at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night shortly after Donald Trump formally received the party’s nomination. It was a primetime opportunity for the Senate majority leader to sing the praises of his party’s standard-bearer on a national stage.But the most McConnell could muster was that Trump would sign the bills that McConnell would send to his desk.The Kentucky senator’s speech was long on pillorying Hillary Clinton and short on celebrating the Republican nominee. He only mentioned Trump’s name when he rattled off a series of bills that the GOP Congress passed and President Barack Obama vetoed. Each time, he simply said, “Donald Trump would sign it.”“With Donald Trump in the White House, Senate Republicans will build on the work we’ve done and pass more bills into law than any Senate in years,” McConnell said.Translation: If nothing else, at least this guy is a Republican.McConnell devoted almost the entirety of his time to attacking Clinton, who’s slated to accept the Democratic nomination next week at the party’s convention in Philadelphia.And yet McConnell still managed to utter the name “Trump” more than his counterpart in the House of Representatives, Speaker Paul Ryan. The Wisconsin Republican only said the nominee’s name twice during his speech to delegates. His praise for the real estate mogul was, well, underwhelming: “Only with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance at a better way.”It’s no shocker that McConnell and Ryan were reluctant to gush over Trump at the convention. Ryan has said he doesn’t consider Trump the right kind of conservative to carry the Republican banner, and he waffled on the idea of endorsing Trump before finally giving him his formal backing in early June. McConnell has given Trump some equally unemphatic support, suggesting his backing is more about party unity than any affinity for the candidate.As Ryan put it on Tuesday, “Democracy is a series of choices. We Republicans have made ours.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

This awesome little Ghostbuster. Matilda Burnett, 7, is a huge fan of the “Ghostbusters” franchise and when it came time to see the new movie, she took it upon herself to dress up for the occasion in a costume that’s nothing short of kickass. The 7-year-old’s dad, Max Burnett, tweeted a photo of his daughter in full gear and it not only got praise from many social media users, but it also got a shoutout from the director of the new “Ghostbusters” movie, Paul Feig. “Okay, this is why we made this movie,” Feig tweeted. “She is awesome and I love that she made her own proton pack! She’s a warrior.”The girl, who proudly wore the costume to a movie theater in Sherman Oaks, California, rocked the jumpsuit complete with the “Ghostbusters” logo on the front, along with the proton pack filled with a small, smiling ghost. (Cute, right?) Burnett told the Huffington Post that Matilda came up with the idea all on her own and just enlisted her mother, Emily, to help make the proton pack and gun out of yarn and a plastic water bottle. “About an hour before we were to leave to the movie theater, she disappeared into her room,” Burnett said. “Thirty minutes later, she had turned an old zookeeper costume she made into a “Ghostbusters” outfit. She had drawn and cut out the patches and attached them with tape.”Right before the family headed out, Matilda quickly ran back and grabbed her most important accessory ― a stuffed ghost she put in her backpack.“Very funny girl,” Burnett added. The costume was well worth it, especially since Matilda ended up loving the reboot, which featured a female quartet. It also reinforced a feminist idea she often talks about. “She was very excited that it was all women. She regularly tells me that there should be more ‘girl bosses’ in the world,” her dad said. “I agree.”In fact, it was this appreciation for girl power that pushed Burnett to share the photo on Twitter. “I was reading an interview with Paul Feig about “Ghostbusters” and he talked a little bit about all the hate he got about casting all women in the movie,” he said. “And so, on a whim, I thought I’d send him, and the actresses, ... Matilda’s photos and let them know that his movie inspired at least one girl to be a hero.” And we can safely say that Matilda is our hero. "
6,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Running Mate Is Still A Mystery To Most Republicans,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-vp_us_578ecf1ae4b0f180da63929e,Mike who?,2016-07-20,Indiana Gov.

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is low-key and liked by the establishment, and has spent his career focused on social issues like fighting abortion and gay rights. And unlike the famous real estate mogul, most people have no idea who Pence is. “I had never heard of him,” said Caroline Curtis, 19, a delegate aid from Firestone, Colorado. “From what I can tell, from just a few little interviews I’ve seen, he seems OK.”“I don’t know much about Pence,” added Tony Leal, a delegate from Los Angeles. “I notice he was a congressman. Because it just happened, and I’ve been so busy with my own campaign, coming here for the convention, I really haven’t had time to vet him myself.”Howard Kline, 55, whose wife is a delegate from Texas, also said he didn’t know anything about Pence.“I don’t know enough about him to say at this point,” he said when asked his opinion of him. “I’m assuming that Trump wouldn’t have picked him if he wasn’t a good candidate.”A poll released Wednesday bears out this shoulder-shrugging about Pence. A majority of registered voters say they don’t know enough about Pence to say whether he’s a good or bad vice presidential pick, according to a new NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll. Pence’s base is considered to be socially conservative evangelical voters. But even among self-described conservatives, a considerable portion don’t know much about him. Nicky Kapadia, a self-described “hard-core Republican” from Los Angeles, also admitted she knew little about him, but now said he seems like “a great conservative” and “a perfect balance for Donald Trump on the ticket.”Even Trump wasn’t sold on his running mate. Trump was scheduled to announce his choice midday Friday, but eventually delayed it because of the attack in Nice, France. As late as midnight Thursday, Trump was still calling advisers and asking whether he could change his mind and choose someone other than Pence ― a man he was pressured to choose for the sake of party unity. Trump personally felt more comfortable with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) or former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). “Pence is a good man ― a former governor, so he’s got executive experience, but he’s also a former legislator,” said Lamar Lewis, 62, a delegate from Temple, Texas, who was more familiar with Pence than most conventiongoers. “He can help Trump, who doesn’t know about the legislative process. He’s somebody who understands how it works. He’ll help him out.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampantxenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
7,POLITICS,Mike Pence Pick Hints At What Kind Of President Trump Would Be,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-vp-trump_us_578e5be9e4b0f180da630b59,The choice shows he'd want to work closely with Congress' most conservative members.,2016-07-20,The party officially nominated the dynamic duo on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578fe2b1190000aa038a74d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― It’s a legitimate mystery what Donald Trump’s relationship with Capitol Hill would look like if he were to become president. But if his selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate is any indication ― and Republicans seem to think it is ― Trump may be looking to work with the most ideologically extreme members of Congress.The Pence pick certainly provides some insight into Trump’s overall electoral game plan. Instead of trying to considerably broaden his appeal with minorities or women, Trump seems to be doubling down on white, conservative men ― shoring up his already white and conservative base of men.But more than a political maneuver, there’s a message to members of Congress in the Pence selection: This is the kind of legislator I want to work with.Before Pence was governor of Indiana, he served 12 years in Congress as a bombastic member of the far-right. He consistently pushed GOP leaders to the right in rhetoric and in policy, even becoming a leader himself ― first as a chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee and then as the GOP Conference Chairman, the No. 3 spot among House Republicans.On policy, Pence showed talent for finding divisive positions that often split Republicans and caused problems for GOP leadership. He was one of the leading voices in pushing congressional Republicans to offset emergency spending for Hurricane Katrina with cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, setting up a consistent battle line in Congress for other natural disasters.His extreme fiscal positions often made other Republicans look less serious about tackling debt. In 2005, he co-sponsored a Social Security privatization bill that, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, would have forced entitlement cuts of roughly 30 percent.He also advocated for ultra-conservative social positions. He tried for years to pass a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. He consistently tried to defund parts of Planned Parenthood. And he fought stem-cell research.In many ways, Pence was a member of the divisive House Freedom Caucus before there ever was a House Freedom Caucus.Trump has already shown a willingness to give the HFC special treatment. Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager, met privately with Freedom Caucus board members ― with the addition of HFC member Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), who was an early Trump supporter ― nearly a month ago for roughly 45 minutes to discuss their concerns and set up a meeting just between the conservative group and Trump.While that meeting hasn’t taken place yet, it’s clear Trump sees conservatives like those in the Freedom Caucus as his natural allies. And choosing Pence to be his vice presidential nominee has already gone a long way toward solidifying support among HFC members, many of whom have shown reluctance over supporting Trump.At least two HFC members, Reps. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), are included among the few Republicans in the House who openly oppose Trump. And many other members of the group have shown reservations about supporting the nominee.But, just as intended, Trump’s VP selection is working to allay some concerns. “Mike Pence is a good, honorable, experienced guy who has a very good understanding of the threat posed to America by our deficits and accumulated debt,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told The Huffington Post this week. “Mike Pence is a valuable addition to the ticket.”Brooks notes his public position is that he’ll support all Republicans on the ticket in November, but he’s repeatedly expressed anxiety over supporting a person with such whimsical political positions.Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) also told HuffPost that while he was already supporting Trump, the Pence pick helped with that decision.“Having served with Pence and knowing him, as well as following his career for years, I believe he is a great fit for Donald Trump,” Duncan said. “In addition to his conservative voting record, he brings strong social conservative credentials to the Trump team.”Still, Trump’s problems with some conservatives run deeper than just a few questions about the candidate’s social conservatism.HFC board member Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost this week that while he was supporting the Republican nominee, he still had some issues with Trump.“Really my concerns are probably more on the balance between Congress and the executive branch,” Meadows said. “And so to the extent that Mike Pence can help a new administration understand the importance of that balance? Certainly.”“But in terms of credentials,” Meadows continued, “whether they be social conservative or fiscal conservative credentials, not as much.”There’s of course a risk in reading too much into what Trump does. He could, at any moment and for any reason, reverse himself on anything. And conservative lawmakers, many of whom have experience in opposing members of their own party, seem suspicious of a nominee with such mutable ideology.Pence would seem to offer Trump a steady Republican ideology. But his own ambition has already shown Republicans that he’s mutable too. (Pence famously called Trump’s Muslim ban “offensive and unconstitutional.” Now, he’s not only on the same ticket with Trump; he’s also reversing course on that position.)Still, for conservatives inside and outside of Congress, Pence is an indication that Trump fashions himself a true conservative. And for Republicans looking to enact a far-right agenda, Trump’s new identity as a far-right conservative is a good sign.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) intended to make merely a glancing reference to Donald Trump in his remarks to delegates here on Wednesday, but soon found himself subject to some heavenly intervention.As Cruz was pondering where he goes from here ― “I don’t know what the future holds. Our party now has a nominee and I don’t know,” he said ― Trump’s 757 unexpectedly flew overhead, interrupting his speech. The Manhattan real estate mogul was landing in Cleveland at that very moment to meet with his new vice presidential running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R). The surprise appearance by Cruz’s bitter primary rival set off a chorus of loud and sustained boos from the approximately 500 delegates gathered at the event. Cruz briefly paused to let them continue before addressing his campaign manager, Jeff Roe.“Jeff, did you email them to fly the plane right when I said that?” he asked, chuckling. “That was pretty well-orchestrated!” The outdoor event along the Cuyahoga River oddly resembled a campaign rally. Cruz’s campaign logo was displayed onstage, and a long line of people stretched outside. At one point, Cruz’s supporters even began chanting “2020,” urging him to run for president again.Yet the Texas senator stressed party unity ahead of his remarks tonight at the convention.“The way to see unity is for us to unite behind shared principles,” Cruz said, adding that everyone has an “obligation to follow our conscience, to speak the truth, and truth is unchangeable.”It’s unclear, however, whether the senator will endorse Trump at the Quicken Loans Arena. Roe told reporters that Cruz’s remarks will be “unifying” and that Trump will be “pleased” with the speech, but said he didn’t know whether Cruz would mention Trump by name.The Trump campaign clearly wants to put the rift in the party behind them. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), an early endorser of Trump and a former presidential candidate himself, told CNN on Wednesday that he hoped Cruz “keeps his word.” Cruz, along with all GOP candidates, had signed an RNC pledge to support the Republican nominee.Delegates in the crowd had a mixed reaction to the possibility that Cruz will endorse Trump. Johnny Lopez, from Texas, said it was time to put differences aside to defeat presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.“I would love to see a speech that says, ‘Let’s unify. Endorse Donald Trump for president,’” Lopez said.George Benjamin, 51, said he didn’t want to see Cruz compromise his conservative principles, no matter the choices in November’s election.“When you base your views on principle, you can compromise on a lot of things. But foundational things, you can’t. So that’s why I’m OK with him not endorsing,” Benjamin said.Others, like Washington state delegate Bill Bruch, still took issue with Trump’s brazen attacks against Cruz’s wife and father.“If I were him, absolutely not ― because of personal attacks, especially against Rafael Cruz,” Bruch said. “I would be shocked if he endorsed him.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

This sentiment persists in the aftermath of multiple police shootings of black civilians.The movement initially emerged in 2013 following the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the man who shot him. The movement has since expanded exponentially in size, organization and tactics ― urging political leaders to reform and address systemic racism endemic in law enforcement and the criminal justice system. Although the Black Lives Matter movement has shone a light on institutional racism and heightened racial discourse in the country, the overarching perception is that it hasn’t helped improve race relations, according to the Monmouth poll. Only 10 percent of all nationwide voters say that the Black Lives Matter movement has made racial issues in the United States better, while 48 percent say it has made things worse. Fifty-five percent of white voters say the movement has made race relations worse, whereas 51 percent of black voters say it hasn’t had much impact.Other polls released earlier this month also point to the notion that race relations are worsening. Nearly 3 in 4 American voters say that race relations in the United States are bad, including 32 percent who characterize them as “very bad,” according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll. This statistic reflects a similar level of pessimism that was evident after the Rodney King verdict 24 years ago.

Lee has a vision for offices and residential buildings that are conducive to physical activity — promoting stair use instead of elevators, for example, and being easily accessible to outdoor spaces.Under the administration of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Lee helped create a set of guidelines for building designers to improve the health of inhabitants. Features like open, prominent stairs and daylight exposure are now fundamental to the city’s new building projects. Lee also introduced a health credit for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, allowing buildings with bike storage and showers, for example, to get more points in green certification.As public awareness of the health risks associated with inactivity and unhealthy diets grows, workplaces are helping employees make healthier decisions. Gyms are a now common sight at many workplaces, standing desks have seemingly infiltrated every industry and office kitchens offer up fresh fruit over chips. But with the typical American spending nearly 50 hours a week at work, there’s a lot of untapped potential in how buildings can be more effective at promoting employee health.Work days are pretty sedentary, with many employees perched on chairs for hours on end without moving around, and new lifestyle changes, like a 20-minute walk outside, take time to really develop into habits.A building’s interior elements ― such as stairs, furniture and signs promoting physical activity ― are key to that behavioral change, according to Lee. That’s where health-focused building plans come in.In New York, numerous libraries, city agencies, police precincts and fire stations have adopted the city’s active design guidelines, which use design to tackle obesity and other related health issues.“The guidelines have had a tremendous impact. We do it for all our public buildings,” said Margaret Castillo, chief architect with the city’s Department of Design and Construction. “We talk about making stairs prominent and beautiful so no one would think of taking the elevator, and making connections between a public building and a plaza.”Daylight makes a big difference. A planned health services building in Chelsea will have outdoor stairs, so people can look at the surrounding trees as they walk up and down. A fire station in Brooklyn will have a central training area that receives natural light and fresh air through the roof. The city hopes to install rooftop gardens on some public buildings to further boost activity and improve employees’ mental wellbeing.“Our roofs are an untapped resource in New York,” Castillo said.While there isn’t yet a formalized way to track how inhabitants are using these building features, the city is developing evaluation tools to measure heart rate and other impacts of increased physical activity.Interior office space should be configured for physical movement, Lee says. Instead of sedentary conference rooms, companies could install standing desks or equipment exercise bikes so employees can pedal during a meeting. Walking routes could be demarcated on the floor: a blue path for a 15-minute loop around one floor or, say, a red path for a 45-minute trek through the building.“Why are standing desks the exception? Why do employees have to request them?” Lee said. “The default should be healthy furniture and spaces.”Lee advocates for giving people crucial information about healthy options just as they’re about to take a certain action. Placing signs by elevators about the calories they could burn by walking, for instance, would increase their stair use. And it’s cheap ― exercise bikes are probably out of budget for many smaller companies, but plastic signs won’t be. When companies are looking for potential office sites, they should be thinking about how the location promotes outdoor activity for employees, Lee adds. That includes easy access to bike lanes and proximity to public spaces, so that workers can walk to a park for lunch instead of eating at their desk.And don’t forget about food. Offices should offer tap water, limit soda and other high-calorie beverages and make sure that healthy food on display, says Lee. At Google, nuts and fruits are placed in glass containers at eye level, while chips and candy are in out of sight in opaque bins. Lower prices for healthy options, too, could act as an incentive.Employers, added Lee, have direct control over physical environments, which means they have a hand in providing healthy spaces for the people who work there. “Once you put that bike rack in, once you’ve bought that furniture, those last for a long time,” Lee said. “It can make a great difference in employee health.”"

Like the gentlest of guardians, Niels keeps watch over his environment while simultaneously falling deeper into its grip. This photograph, taken in 2015, is part of Finnish-Norwegian artists Karoline Hjorth and Riitta Ikonen series “Eyes as Big as Plates.” Since 2011, the photographers have documented retired farmers, fishermen, zoologists, plumbers, opera singers, housewives, artists, academics and 90-year-old parachutists in a variety of handmade costumes inspired by natural environments. “We were curious and on a mission to find out what kind of connection the Norwegians had with their rocks, fjords and hills,” the artists explained in an email to The Huffington Post. “And [we were] especially keen on looking at the folktales where nature or natural phenomenons were personified. Folktales often made complex natural and sociological issues understandable and accessible, with phenomena taking on forms and characteristics that even a mere mortal could have a dialogue with.”Scandinavian folklore, which was collected on a large scale in the 17th century, features mythological tales revolving around trolls, mermaids, water spirits, seductresses and she-wolves. The mystical beings offered fantastical explanations for the natural world’s many mysteries, offering a neo-pagan alternative to Christianity. In a way, “Eyes as Big as Plates,” the artists explain, is a contemporary take on the same gesture, of approaching humans’ relationship to nature in an accessible language. “We reasoned that the older the local interviewee we would work with, the closer we would be to the tellers of the tales and the talking rocks of the stories,” they said. “Those Nordic hills hadn’t changed since the tales, but the people sure had.”Hjorth and Ikonen began working together in 2011, after Ikonen Googled “Norway + Grannies + Photographer” in search of a collaborator. Both artists are interested in depicting older people in their work. Intrigued by a particular combination of experience and curiosity, the artists seek out subjects who are often overlooked and marginalized by society at large. Through their stunning images, in which senior citizens are transformed into mythical beings outside time and place, the artists hope to address the stigmatization and marginalization so many elderly individuals face every day. By working with older subjects, the artists also allude to the radical changes that both the natural world and our understanding of it have undergone in recent years. “So many natural phenomenons that were mysterious in the past can be explained to a dulling degree of practicality in 2016 and the hills with rocks are at times undisguised to nonexistence,” Hjorth and Ikonen said. “Our quest with the project therefore turned more toward imagination and curiosity and the title ‘Eyes as Big as Plates’ seemed to fittingly describe many of our models’ way of looking at the world.”Hjorth and Ikonen begin their process by seeking out the best bogs, hills, glaciers and volcanic plateaus to set their scenes. They then forage the area for moss, sticks, rhubarb, and whatever else is available, fashioning the natural materials into a makeshift disguise. Ikonen is in charge of the wearable sculptures at the forefront of each image, while Hjorth mans the camera. Over the past five years, “Eyes as Big as Plates” has left the internet collectively open-mouthed, providing real-life images that seem ripped from the pages of a Nordic fable. The popularity of the project has allowed Hjorth and Ikonen to continue it on a larger scale, traveling to locations including South Korea, Japan and Switzerland. They find their subjects through friends, family and newspaper ads, as well as chance meetings on the street, in a noodle shop, or wherever luck takes them. The artists are currently working on a photography book chronicling the project, featuring 50 magical portraits. The duo raised 47,1567 Swedish Krona, or approximately $55,000, on Kickstarter, far exceeding their goal to make the vision a reality. “We both grew up with an understanding of the outdoors as something intermixable with the indoors,” the artists said. “It is part of every day and the awareness and interaction with our surroundings still drives our practices strongly. Both of us live in big cities so there is a definite need to roll in the leaves regularly. We are a bit hesitant to talk about nature as we’re coming to think that there is no such thing.

16,LATINO VOICES,A Textbook That Paints Mexican-Americans As Lazy Could Be Coming To A School Near You,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-textbook-mexican-american-studies_us_578e607ae4b0f180da630e38,"It's ""deeply flawed,"" but that hasn't stopped the Texas State Board of Education before.",2016-07-20,"Eloisa Moreno, Ruben Garza and Eloy Gonzalez look over papers as they wait for a Texas State Board of Education hearing to begin in Austin in 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A proposed Mexican-American studies textbook has drawn harsh criticism for what Latino educators and scholars in Texas are calling a lack of scholarly expertise, major factual inaccuracies and demeaning characterizations of Mexican-Americans. “What we have now is a deeply flawed and a deeply offensive textbook,” Celina Moreno, of the Texas Latino Education Coalition, said at a Monday press conference.Groups like Moreno’s came together with professors who specialize in Mexican-American heritage, and who had been independently scrutinizing the textbook, to share some of their disturbing findings.Emilio Zamora, a professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin, reviewed material that covered the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846-48 to the present. He said he found “five to seven serious, serious errors per page,” which render the entire publication “useless and even counterproductive.” The Texas State Board of Education is currently reviewing the book for potential approval. Although the book’s fate is far from clear, the board has previously approved textbooks and curricula that deny climate change, promote creationism, whitewash historical events and maintain that the roots of Western democracy are found in the Bible. And last year, the board rejected a proposal that state-approved elementary and high school textbooks be fact-checked by academics. RELATED: Texas Schools May Charge $70 For Racist Textbook That Whitewashes HistoryBecause of the state’s tremendous clout in the educational publishing world, Dan Quinn of the nonpartisan educational watchdog group Texas Freedom Network told HuffPost that content that makes the grade in the Lone Star State is likely to be adopted ― in some form or another ― well beyond its borders.The Latino educators at Monday’s press conference were originally hoping that they’d be celebrating a victory, not fighting a battle. The state board had rejected prior calls to formalize a Mexican-American studies curriculum, even though Latinos make up the largest percentage of Texas public school students (almost 52 percent) and advocates cite research indicating that such a curriculum would help boost student performance.Then, a 2011 state law that enabled school districts to buy whatever materials they wanted with state money ― as opposed to just those approved by the board of education ― opened up the possibility of districts embracing Mexican-American studies. But only a handful of schools created their own curriculum to teach Latino heritage.“In practice, [schools] almost always buy the materials the state board approves” as that makes it easier to comply with the state’s education requirements, Quinn said. So the thinking was that if there were an approved textbook on Mexican-American heritage, “schools would be more likely to adopt a course of study.”But with the market still small, he said few publishers were willing to submit to the arduous process of Texas State Board of Education review.The lone proposal for a Mexican-American heritage textbook came from Momentum Instructions, a company linked to Cynthia Dunbar, a former education board member known for her extreme conservative views. Quinn described her four-year term on the board as “one culture war after another.” In a 2008 book titled One Nation Under God ― released while Dunbar was still serving on the state board ― she called public education “tyrannical” and a “subtly deceptive tool of perversion,” according to the Texas Observer. As for the proposed textbook, Quinn suggested that Dunbar and its authors were seeking to “promote their own political and personal ideas.” He said the authors lack credible expertise in the field of Mexican-American studies.Emails and calls to Momentum Instructions were not immediately returned. Members of the Responsible Ethnic Studies Textbook Coalition agreed with Quinn’s assessment of the authors’ expertise, stating at Monday’s press conference that they failed to accurately or comprehensively portray either Mexican-American culture or history. “This text has the look of a task given to an intern who has been told to cobble together what they can using the Internet,” José María Herrera, an assistant professor in education at the University of Texas at El Paso, said in a statement linked to the press conference.The textbook doesn’t even bother to distinguish Mexican-Americans from other Latino or Hispanic communities, conflating Spanish and Colombian traditions with those of Mexico, according to Herrera. Zamora highlighted inaccurate and just plain offensive characterizations of events and figures. “The authors characterized most Mexican-American civil rights and labor leaders as social and political threats to American society,” he said.One such passage described the Chicano movement, a 1960s push for the empowerment of Mexican-Americans, as an effort that “opposed Western civilization” and aimed to “destroy this society.” Another particularly glaring passage from the discussion of labor relations during the 1800s described Mexican workers as lazy:“Industrialists were very driven, competitive men who were always on the clock and continually concerned about efficiency. They were used to their workers putting in a full day’s work, quietly and obediently, and respecting rules, authority, and property. In contrast, Mexican laborers were not reared to put in a full day’s work so vigorously. There was a cultural attitude of ‘mañana,’ or ‘tomorrow,’ when it came to high-gear production.” “It is simply unworthy of consideration as a textbook,” Zamora said. Their frustration is that a much better book would benefit not only Texas schoolchildren but the growing Latino population across the U.S. “It’s not that people want to teach these courses out of separatism ― it’s so the students can see themselves in the cultural fabric of the American experience,” Quinn told HuffPost. “And right now, in a lot of ways, they don’t see themselves in these history textbooks.”"

Juan Valdez ― yes, like the coffee guy ― is one of the dozens, if not hundreds, of street vendors hawking merchandise on the streets of downtown Cleveland, hoping to capitalize on the political fervor and Trump fandom of the tens of thousands of people who’ve descended on the city for the quadrennial GOP gathering. “I was actually going for Bernie Sanders, but he didn’t make the cut,” Valdez told The Huffington Post, “and I’ve still got bills to pay.”To pay those bills, Valdez is selling Trump buttons: one features a silhouette of the GOP candidate’s famous hairdo, another has Trump’s face affixed to a poker chip surrounded by the words “BET ON TRUMP,” and a third Rosie the Riveter with the words “TRUMP CAN DO IT” over the iconic World War II image. Valdez is particularly fond of several buttons he claims to have made himself: one that reads “I’M ONLY HERE FOR THE POKEMON” and another that says “WE SHALL OVERCOMB” above Trump’s hair.This isn’t Valdez’s first rodeo: He says he followed Barack Obama around during his 2008 and 2012 campaigns selling merchandise and spent most of this cycle selling pins at “as many Bernie Sanders events as I could,” but was forced to find a new candidate to trail. The Republican nominee could only admire his willingness to cast political beliefs aside for the purposes of making a buck.“Politics is the new sport, and that’s why I’m in the middle of it,” says Valdez, who added he’ll probably write in Sanders when he votes in his home state of Colorado.Few things define political conventions quite like the flair: After the balloon drop, these national events are a blur of colorful signs, iridescent outerwear and ― we’re looking at you, Texas delegation ― heinous, state-themed uniforms. For every one camera that was trained on the stage at the Quicken Loans Arena on Monday and Tuesday night, another was trolling the floor for b-roll of a person in a distinctively bejeweled boater hat.In interviews, the purveyors of that flair didn’t necessarily share the delegates’ enthusiasm for Trump and the Republican Party. One vendor, who was selling Trump whoopee cushions (”Make America TOOT Again”), didn’t think his political leanings needed to be clarified. “Can’t you tell?” he said. “I want to sit on his face.” On Euclid Avenue, a man from Massachusetts who asked that his name not be printed was selling a number of eye-catching Trump items, including buttons that read “TRUMP 2016: FINALLY SOMEONE WITH BALLS” and “HOT CHICKS FOR TRUMP.” However, he didn’t share the enthusiasm expressed in his wares. “Him and Reagan, don’t like them that much,” he said of Trump. Asked what he thought of Mike Pence, Trump’s running mate, the man was surprised: “Oh, so that’s who he chose!?!”Tim Moore, from just outside Cleveland, said that he’s been to “every Trump rally,” and is “a big fan” of the candidate. So does that mean he’s voting for Trump?“I don’t like [Trump] at all,” he quickly clarified. “I like his money, though. I’m a big fan of his money.” Alex, a button vendor who also hailed from outside Cleveland and who asked that his last name not be used, told HuffPost he only sold merchandise at Trump rallies. So, was he a Trump supporter? “Nah,” he replied. Alex added that he probably won’t vote this November. They aren’t all opportunists and agnostics, however. Mary Puckett, a vivacious woman from Atlanta, with a close-cropped bleached hairdo roughly the same hue as the “BOMB THE HELL OUT OF ISIS” buttons for sale at her stand on Euclid Avenue, said it was her first time selling merchandise at a convention. “My spirit of entrepreneurship has been awakened in me by the last eight years of Obama,” she told HuffPost. “He is an embarrassment to the United States of America, starting from his first State of the Union to the Cinco de Mayo dress that Michelle [Obama] wore and decorating the White House for gay marriage.” Puckett supported Ben Carson in the primary, but tells HuffPost she’s now aboard the Trump train.

Nobody was arrested.Hundreds of officers policing protests surrounding the Republican National Convention here faced one of their first major tests Tuesday as demonstrators gathered to sound off on a variety of topics in Public Square, located a few blocks away from the Quicken Loans Arena. Later, as protesters took to the streets, officers used their bikes to block their path to the place where Donald Trump officially became the 2016 Republican presidential nominee.Jones, a right-wing radio host who operates the website InfoWars and has supported conspiracy theories around Sept. 11 and mass shootings, was escorted away from the protests by agents of the state after a physical confrontation in which Jones appeared to have been shoved. InfoWars called the protesters “violent leftists” and “rabid commies.” Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said there were no arrests during the demonstrations at Public Square. While officers temporarily shut down access to the area, only allowing demonstrators to leave the area and slowly nudging protesters out, they never took anyone into custody. Williams said the bikes being used by officers to police protests had been very effective.A responsible and professional response to demonstrations had not been guaranteed going into the protests in Cleveland. Especially after the murder of five police officers in Dallas during a protest associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, tensions were high. The Cleveland Police Department, which was heavily criticized in a Justice Department report that found systemic brutality, has come under close scrutiny after one of its officers shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice in November 2014.In preparation for the convention, police stocked up on less-than-lethal ammunition and riot gear. News outlets (including The Huffington Post) dispatched reporters to Cleveland with the primary assignment of covering the unrest and the police reaction.But as of Tuesday evening, all signs indicated that the police would not overreact to demonstrations. They appeared to be attempting to avoid making arrests. While having a variety of agencies from across the country assisting Cleveland in policing the demonstrations led to some minor issues (officers from some agencies were not wearing name plates or displaying badge numbers, for example) the approach to the protests was consistent.Additional reporting by Arthur Delaney and Dave Jamieson.Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the Revolutionary Communist Party as the “Revolutionary Community Party.”"

This would allow officials to keep their jobs in a new, possibly Republican, administration, Christie said.“It’s called burrowing,” Christie said. “You take them from the political appointee side into the civil service side, in order to try to set up ... roadblocks for your successor, kind of like when all the Clinton people took all the Ws off the keyboard when George Bush was coming into the White House.”Christie was referring to pranks committed during the presidential transition from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush in 2001. During that period, some White House staffers removed the W key on computer keyboards and left derogatory signs and stickers in offices, according to a report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress.“One of the things I have suggested to Donald is that we have to immediately ask the Republican Congress to change the civil service laws. Because if they do, it will make it a lot easier to fire those people,” Christie said.He said firing civil servants was “cumbersome” and “time-consuming.”There was no immediate comment from the American Federation of Government Employees, which is the largest federal employee union in the United States.Christie also told the gathering that changing the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency, long a target of Republicans concerned about over regulation, would be a top priority for Trump should he win in November.Trump has previously vowed to eliminate the EPA and roll back some of America’s most ambitious environmental policies, actions that he says would revive the U.S. oil and coal industries and bolster national security.Christie added that the Trump team wants to let businesspeople serve in government part time without having to give up their jobs in the private sector. Trump frequently says he is better equipped to be president because of his business experience.Although Christie was repeatedly asked during the meeting, he declined to name any potential Cabinet picks. He said Trump was not ready to do that yet.(Reporting By Emily Flitter, editing by Caren Bohan and Ross Colvin)"
20,TECH,We've Been Trying To Make Cities Walkable For Years. 'Pokemon Go' Did It Overnight.,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pokemon-go-cities-walking-public-space_us_578e8581e4b07c722ebc993e,How catching Pikachu could give you a taste of Parisian street life.,2016-07-20,"Walking while playing ""Pokemon Go"" in New York City, July 13, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578eae351300002d0005ecd5.jpeg?cache=fptg5u7QXQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The streets, parks and sprawling strip malls of America’s cities and suburbs have become infested with a new urban species: the “Pokemon Go” player.Ambling about with phones held aloft, these specimens have their eyes glued to their screens, seemingly incapable of viewing their surroundings. Their unpredictable roaming has brought chaos and scorn, and they’ve walked into ponds and police stations, off a cliff and into criminals’ traps.I should know: I’m one of them, and I can’t help but get excited about the way this game ― often on the fritz and causing all sorts of trouble in the real world ― is breathing life into overlooked public spaces.Millions of people are playing Nintendo’s augmented reality app, where you hunt for Pokemon as your on-screen character mirrors your real-world movements on a map. As they play, human “trainers” wander around neighborhoods to search for the cartoon creatures, meeting other players by chance in public parks and gathering “Poke balls” at local historic and cultural landmarks. They’re going on long walks they’d never take otherwise, and adventuring into new parts of their cities. That’s not all that remarkable, but it’s a total reversal from the way most Americans typically get around. For decades, cities have made accommodations for cars at the expense of walking, biking and public transit, creating streets where walking feels unsafe, unappealing or impractical.There are obvious exceptions, like New York City, and Portland, Oregon, and officials have begun to take note of the economic, health and environmental value of walkable cities. But even if many people want to walk, most don’t. More than 80 percent of all daily trips in the U.S. were taken by car in 2010, and only 13 percent of kids walked to elementary school and middle school in 2009, compared with 48 percent in 1969.But what urban planners and forward-thinking mayors have struggled to accomplish with development or pedestrian-safety infrastructure, Nintendo seems to have done for thousands of places and millions of people in just a few days ― even if it doesn’t last.John Conley, a 24-year-old gamer who uses the handle Apex Gaming, lives in Houston, and regularly drives to nature areas outside city limits to walk recreationally with his girlfriend. Since they started playing “Pokemon Go,” however, they’ve explored Houston on foot, checking out more than a dozen parks and neighborhoods they’d never seen. A few days ago, Conley noticed the “Pokemon Go” effect at a small park with a pond and trail that he passes daily on his commute.“To see it empty all the time, I would just think, ‘Oh man, it’s such a shame it’s not being put to use,’” he said. “But now it’s full of people.”The app’s users are reclaiming public spaces for informal play, said Daniel Latorre, senior fellow of digital placemaking at the nonprofit Project for Public Spaces.“Pokemon Go” gives people opportunities to walk around and have spontaneous encounters and social interactions, which can be one of the best parts of urban life. “The reason why people in New York, or Paris, or other highly walkable cities, walk a lot is because they’re dense, and there’s a lot of things to do and the public space is quite lively,” Latorre said. With Pokemon ― and people chasing them ― popping up unexpectedly on the landscape, even the most homogenous suburban cul-de-sac may offer a mini-digital dose of the excitement found strolling down a Parisian street.”’Pokemon Go’ is this sort of, seemingly overnight activation of public space,” Latorre said. “One of the lessons that can be drawn from this is, well, wouldn’t it be great if some of these activated spaces that I’m sure are empty lots or boring parks … had more variety for play or social gathering spaces.”Of course, many “Pokemon Go” users are drawn to the game for the nostalgia and the novelty ― not the walking ― and people have figured out hacks to play without moving, or they play while they drive, which is as dangerous as it sounds. So, when the novelty wears off, players may retreat back into their homes and cars. For some, the game is fearful, not playful. Women have been bombarded by unwanted attention from male players who feel emboldened to pester them because they’re both looking for Pokemon, writes Slate’s Laura Hudson.Bystanders who aren’t familiar with the game have called the police about “suspicious,” loitering players. Omari Akil writes that as a black man, he worries about being viewed as a threat and shot in a police encounter. For him, playing feels like putting his life in danger. But the fact that a group of kids prompts neighbors to call the police says a lot more about our low regard for public space ― we think it’s weird when people use it ― than it does about the game. “Pokemon Go” makes you aware of some of the obstacles to having safe, enjoyable public space for everybody, whether by leading you to a Pokestop at an abandoned building, or making you navigate around a freeway interchange as a pedestrian. The game has also caused players to wear out their welcome in public space, nearly taking over a tiny Australian suburb with huge crowds and playing at sacred sites like the 9/11 Memorial. Those and other disruptions have prompted frustrations with the game’s design as well as with those who are playing.Teens in New Britain, Connecticut, have played the game at a local cemetery, a park after it closes for the night and a local World War II memorial. Mayor Erin Stewart (R) isn’t worried about it.“While some people view it as kind of disrespecting the war memorial ... this could be a good thing, because these kids would never visit this memorial otherwise,” Stewart said. The 29-year-old mayor got into the first Pokemon craze as a kid and has spent some time playing the new game. When the game caught on, Stewart and a friend saw an opportunity to sell their town and made maps of local “Pokemon Go” destinations, which proved popular with residents. “The young people in our community are getting out, they’re getting off the couch and out of their houses and walking around town,” Stewart said, as three “Pokemon Go” players walked past her window. “They’re discovering a lot of new things that the city has, that they’ve never seen before.”"

But she’s getting high praise from someone in the far-left ranks of the Democratic Party, too: Dennis Kucinich.“I thought she demonstrated grace, heart, poise and inner beauty,” Kucinich told The Huffington Post on Tuesday, after crossing paths on the street. “It’s too bad that whoever was working on the speech didn’t have the sense to vet it to make sure there wasn’t any material in there that duplicated anyone else. But it doesn’t take away from the fact that she demonstrated some special qualities.”Kucinich, a former progressive congressman from Ohio and former presidential candidate, said he doesn’t know Donald Trump at all ― “he’s one of the few people in national politics I’ve never met” ― but feels for Melania Trump, who he said doesn’t deserve to be clobbered for a speech that conveyed an otherwise positive message.“When politics gets to the point of where you just denigrate people, and don’t give them anything, just nothing ― you won’t respect anything that they honor or represent as a human being ― that’s the wrong direction,” he said. “You’ve got to give people their humanity. To try to strip her of that at a moment when she demonstrated such quintessential poise, it’s just not fair.”Kucinich, who was mayor of Cleveland in the late 1970s, seemed to know everybody on the street as he spoke. A car full of guys honked and waved; he waved back. He shook hands with group of police officers passing by, thanking them for their service. He took pictures with some fans.He kept on defending Melania Trump’s speech, though.“The internal message of her speech was really one of grace. That’s getting pummeled now,” Kucinch continued. “Okay, got it. Somebody lifted the sourcing ... Just think if people working with her had used that speech to quote directly from Michelle Obama. To say, ‘Okay, I feel the same way about my husband.’ Because then you can create the connection and that would have been okay.”Asked how he feel about the Trumps potentially moving into the White House, Kucinich, who is currently a political analyst on Fox News Channel, had a little less to say.“It’s still early in the campaign,” he said. “I’m really covering this campaign as somebody in the media, not as a political person.”"

Our staff reporters will provide education coverage from Cleveland and Philadelphia.CLEVELAND— Cleveland Metropolitan School District has a countdown clock to Election Day on its website. When city residents head to the polls that day, they’ll be doing more than picking a president. They’ll be voting on whether the city should keep working on its ambitious overhaul of the school system.In 2012, Cleveland embarked on a plan to improve education by making high-quality early education available and affordable for all families; creating a selection of high-performing schools in each neighborhood; and developing systems to help high school graduates succeed in college or careers.That year, voters passed a levy that raised school taxes by nearly 40 percent to pay for this plan, ultimately adding about $60 million a year to the school district’s budget of about $725 million. Officials gave themselves till 2016 to show progress. There have been some improvements, such as new schools and higher graduation rates, but there is still a long way to go. Now, officials are hoping that the gains they’ve made will persuade voters to renew the levy and buy them four more years of increased funding and time to fix the schools.“It’s a do-or-die thing,” said Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson. “If we fail, public education becomes a shell of itself.”Related: Republicans and education—where they’ve been and where they’re goingCleveland, a Rust Belt city on the shores of Lake Erie, is one of the poorest big cities in the country. Roughly 36 percent of its residents and more than half its children live below the federal poverty line. About half of Clevelanders are black, but black residents make up nearly two-thirds of those living in poverty.This week, 35,000 delegates and visitors have descended on Cleveland for the nomination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has run on a pledge to “Make America Great Again.” The city has been working to rebuild itself for years. Although there are signs of growth throughout the city, particularly downtown, and some businesses are thriving, many community members say that lasting revitalization depends on having good schools.“The future health and welfare and quality of life in the city is inextricably tied up in the schools,” said Helen Williams, program director for education for the Cleveland Foundation, one of two major foundations in the city that has helped financially back the plan. “If we don’t educate young people, we’re not going to have a competitive workforce.”In 2010, the school district was running on a bare bones budget. The vast majority of students were stuck in failing or low-performing schools and barely half of them graduated. Most of the graduates didn’t go on to earn a college degree.Enter “The Cleveland Plan” — a 114-page document developed by city officials, public-interest foundations, the business community and charter school leaders to “reinvent public education,” as Williams puts it. Some of the ideas, like reducing the role of seniority during teacher layoffs, though controversial, were in vogue at the time. Others, such as increasing principals’ authority over school budgets, were less popular but had shown promise in other communities.Four years after the plan was put in motion by the state legislature, there are positive signs. This year, district enrollment went up for the first time in roughly 20 years. Nearly three-quarters of residents said Cleveland schools were moving in the right direction in a 2015 poll. Students’ growth scores, which show how much a student has progressed from year to year, on state tests were rated a C in 2014-2015, after two years of being an F. The graduation rate is up to 66 percent and the percentage of those graduates who are not ready for college level work has dipped from 76 to 66.Last year, the city also made some of the largest gains nationwide on a federal assessment that was given to urban districts. But the scores were still low: only 11 percent of fourth and eighth-graders were proficient in reading, for instance. A 2015 report on the Cleveland Plan’s progress found that 79 percent of children were still enrolled in failing or low-performing district or charter schools.The CEO of the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, Eric Gordon, and many more involved in the Cleveland Plan, readily admits that improvement has been too slow. “There’s a lot more work to be done,” he said. “We have really, really struggled to move some of our lowest performing schools forward as quickly as we’d like.”There has also been friction with the teachers’ union, which is in contract negotiations this summer. In March, more than 3,000 of its members voted nearly unanimously that they had no confidence in Gordon. Tracy Radich, the union’s vice president, criticized the plan embracing the use of student test scores to account for 50 percent of a teacher’s rating for some teachers and changing procedures to determine which teachers should be let go during layoffs.Related: Republican platform for higher ed: Less red tape and less moneyRadich agrees that the district has made strides in recent years. But, she says, it has more to do with the fact that funding is better than it has been for decades thanks to the levy, rather than the changes made under the Cleveland Plan. The funding has allowed for class sizes to be reduced and more resources for classrooms. “Those are the things that have made the most impact,” she said. One feature of the plan that she said she supported, however, is the endeavor to send better-prepared students into schools in the first place. In 2013, only 16 percent of entering kindergarteners scored in the top tier on Ohio’s kindergarten readiness exam, meaning they were fully ready to start school.“Where we are with education attainment, we cannot catch these kids up,” said Katie Kelly, the executive director of Pre4Cle. That nonprofit organization was born out of the Cleveland Plan, to expand the number of high-quality preschool seats in the city. Pre4Cle is trying to help the best centers grow, while helping the lower-quality centers improve. Last year, they added 1,200 seats and they expect to hit 2,000 by the end of 2016. The group also has a huge parent outreach effort to help families look for good preschools.The goal is to get every child into a preschool as good as the Bingham Early Learning Center. It’s located in a housing project in Central, a poor, majority-black neighborhood in Cleveland, and has five stars from the state’s quality rating system. (Pre4Cle defines high quality as having a rating of three stars or higher.)Eva Peeples, whose four-year-old son attends the center agrees that it’s very good. She praised the staff for giving parents a voice, taking the kids on trips and helping her son, who was once too shy to talk to his classmates, build his confidence.“He’s opened up to where he goes into the classroom every day, he runs over to give his friends a high-five,” Peeples said.The center is focused on creating a safe, welcoming environment for the children, while helping them develop the social and emotional skills they’ll need in kindergarten and beyond. The walls are plastered with children’s artwork and pictures of the kids playing or working on projects.Throughout the day, toddlers and preschoolers will pick their own activities, like building with blocks or playing at a water table, and will then talk as a group about the choices they made. They’ll have story time where the teacher will ask them questions about what they read, and opportunities to learn through play. All the teachers have bachelor’s degrees and assistant teachers have at least an associate’s degree.But a center like this, where families cannot afford to pay much, requires substantial investment of public or private money. In Cleveland, it’s taking both. Many parents at Bingham, for instance, are eligible for a scholarship from the countywide universal pre-K program, which helps families whose incomes fall below 400 percent of the federal poverty level pay a portion of preschool tuition. The county set aside $10 million for the program last year and asked the business community to match it. They ended up raising $12 million in three months.Related: Trump plan would base student loans on employability“This is a group of private investors, of corporations or wealthy families, who … understand high-quality is not inexpensive,” said Paul Clark, the regional vice president of PNC Bank, who led the fundraising effort. But “it’s not expensive when you consider the alternatives. It’s actually an incredible investment.”Evidence of the business community’s commitment to the education reforms is everywhere. The city has revamped its five career academies. In addition to teaching core academic subjects, these schools also give students a head start in different careers, such as welding, law enforcement or health services, often with hands-on-training. Educators at these five schools are partnering with businesses to provide students with experiences out in the field.A new high school is opening this week that will have a campus at a large city hospital to expose students to health care careers. An International Baccalaureate k-8 school is on Cleveland State University’s campus and works closely with the higher education institution.(Disclaimer: Development of the new high school was paid for, in part, by a grant by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which is among the numerous funders of the Hechinger Report.)These are all examples of the city’s “portfolio” approach to building its school system. As Gordon explains it, Cleveland doesn’t need 100 unique schools. It needs a few different types of schools for families to choose from and it needs them all to be high quality. That includes traditional neighborhood schools, charter schools, career academies and themed schools such as MC2 STEM High School. This school has multiple campuses, including one at the General Electric Lighting Institute, where students work with GE engineers in a yearlong mentorship program.As the name implies, the school specializes in science, math and engineering. Students are given large long-term projects that they then work on in all their classes over the course of a semester. The juniors this year had to write lyrics to and record rap songs about social ills such as gender inequality and poverty. In their government class, students talked about these issues and how they relate to the 2016 election. In English, they studied rhyme schemes. In science class, they learned about sound, and built recording booths in engineering class.Related: What happens to a high school when a transformative principal walks away?Other Cleveland students who are in schools that stimulate them say their experience helped prepare them for higher education. When he was in elementary school, Justin Alvis’ parents used to give him homework because his teachers didn’t. “There weren’t a lot of students there who were on track,” he said.So his family leapt at the chance to try a new charter school, Entrepreneurship Preparatory School, a place with “very rigorous” academics that not only gave homework every night, but required that his parents sign it once completed, Alvis said. From there he went to a prestigious private high school and is now a senior at the historically black university in Virginia, Hampton University.E Prep, as it is called, is now part of a network, Breakthrough Schools, which is working with the city to expand to 20 schools by 2020. They’ll have 12 this fall and are spending the summer recruiting 1,350 new students.But hundreds of local kids remain stuck in traditional neighborhood schools, which more often than not, remain stubbornly low-performing.“We know from the national work that turning around low performing schools is much more difficult than shuttering and starting over,” Gordon said. “It is much more difficult work to transform from within.”The district has designated 23 badly-performing schools in the city’s poorest neighborhoods as “investment schools” to overhaul. In some cases, this meant replacing entire staffs. In all the schools, the district is partnering with local groups to provide medical, mental health and social services to students there in an effort to turn them around.It’s hard to know how well that program is working, though. This spring, the state will give students its third new standardized test in three years, meaning accurately comparing results from year to year is basically impossible.The testing whiplash creates a big problem for measuring the impact of the entire plan and is on the minds of educators throughout the city. At a summer meeting of a group of 10 principals new to the profession, Gordon presented the plan and then fielded questions. The first was about how schools would be held accountable for improvement going forward. Gordon spoke about going beyond the state report card data and developing other district-specific tools.Then came the second question: “What will happen if the levy doesn’t pass?”Although Gordon and Mayor Jackson expect the levy to be renewed without a problem, he answered the question without hesitation. “The Cleveland Plan is over.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education."

They’ll be voting on whether the city should keep working on its ambitious overhaul of the school system.In 2012, Cleveland embarked on a plan to improve education by making high-quality early education available and affordable for all families; creating a selection of high-performing schools in each neighborhood; and developing systems to help high school graduates succeed in college or careers.That year, voters passed a levy that raised school taxes by nearly 40 percent to pay for this plan, ultimately adding about $60 million a year to the school district’s budget of about $725 million. Officials gave themselves till 2016 to show progress. There have been some improvements, such as new schools and higher graduation rates, but there is still a long way to go. Now, officials are hoping that the gains they’ve made will persuade voters to renew the levy and buy them four more years of increased funding and time to fix the schools.“It’s a do-or-die thing,” said Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson. “If we fail, public education becomes a shell of itself.”Related: Republicans and education—where they’ve been and where they’re goingCleveland, a Rust Belt city on the shores of Lake Erie, is one of the poorest big cities in the country. Roughly 36 percent of its residents and more than half its children live below the federal poverty line. About half of Clevelanders are black, but black residents make up nearly two-thirds of those living in poverty.This week, 35,000 delegates and visitors have descended on Cleveland for the nomination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has run on a pledge to “Make America Great Again.” The city has been working to rebuild itself for years. Although there are signs of growth throughout the city, particularly downtown, and some businesses are thriving, many community members say that lasting revitalization depends on having good schools.“The future health and welfare and quality of life in the city is inextricably tied up in the schools,” said Helen Williams, program director for education for the Cleveland Foundation, one of two major foundations in the city that has helped financially back the plan. “If we don’t educate young people, we’re not going to have a competitive workforce.”In 2010, the school district was running on a bare bones budget. The vast majority of students were stuck in failing or low-performing schools and barely half of them graduated. Most of the graduates didn’t go on to earn a college degree.Enter “The Cleveland Plan” — a 114-page document developed by city officials, public-interest foundations, the business community and charter school leaders to “reinvent public education,” as Williams puts it. Some of the ideas, like reducing the role of seniority during teacher layoffs, though controversial, were in vogue at the time. Others, such as increasing principals’ authority over school budgets, were less popular but had shown promise in other communities.Four years after the plan was put in motion by the state legislature, there are positive signs. This year, district enrollment went up for the first time in roughly 20 years. Nearly three-quarters of residents said Cleveland schools were moving in the right direction in a 2015 poll. Students’ growth scores, which show how much a student has progressed from year to year, on state tests were rated a C in 2014-2015, after two years of being an F. The graduation rate is up to 66 percent and the percentage of those graduates who are not ready for college level work has dipped from 76 to 66.Last year, the city also made some of the largest gains nationwide on a federal assessment that was given to urban districts. But the scores were still low: only 11 percent of fourth and eighth-graders were proficient in reading, for instance. A 2015 report on the Cleveland Plan’s progress found that 79 percent of children were still enrolled in failing or low-performing district or charter schools.The CEO of the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, Eric Gordon, and many more involved in the Cleveland Plan, readily admits that improvement has been too slow. “There’s a lot more work to be done,” he said. “We have really, really struggled to move some of our lowest performing schools forward as quickly as we’d like.”There has also been friction with the teachers’ union, which is in contract negotiations this summer. In March, more than 3,000 of its members voted nearly unanimously that they had no confidence in Gordon. Tracy Radich, the union’s vice president, criticized the plan embracing the use of student test scores to account for 50 percent of a teacher’s rating for some teachers and changing procedures to determine which teachers should be let go during layoffs.Related: Republican platform for higher ed: Less red tape and less moneyRadich agrees that the district has made strides in recent years. But, she says, it has more to do with the fact that funding is better than it has been for decades thanks to the levy, rather than the changes made under the Cleveland Plan. The funding has allowed for class sizes to be reduced and more resources for classrooms. “Those are the things that have made the most impact,” she said. One feature of the plan that she said she supported, however, is the endeavor to send better-prepared students into schools in the first place. In 2013, only 16 percent of entering kindergarteners scored in the top tier on Ohio’s kindergarten readiness exam, meaning they were fully ready to start school.“Where we are with education attainment, we cannot catch these kids up,” said Katie Kelly, the executive director of Pre4Cle. That nonprofit organization was born out of the Cleveland Plan, to expand the number of high-quality preschool seats in the city. Pre4Cle is trying to help the best centers grow, while helping the lower-quality centers improve. Last year, they added 1,200 seats and they expect to hit 2,000 by the end of 2016. The group also has a huge parent outreach effort to help families look for good preschools.The goal is to get every child into a preschool as good as the Bingham Early Learning Center. It’s located in a housing project in Central, a poor, majority-black neighborhood in Cleveland, and has five stars from the state’s quality rating system. (Pre4Cle defines high quality as having a rating of three stars or higher.)Eva Peeples, whose four-year-old son attends the center agrees that it’s very good. She praised the staff for giving parents a voice, taking the kids on trips and helping her son, who was once too shy to talk to his classmates, build his confidence.“He’s opened up to where he goes into the classroom every day, he runs over to give his friends a high-five,” Peeples said.The center is focused on creating a safe, welcoming environment for the children, while helping them develop the social and emotional skills they’ll need in kindergarten and beyond. The walls are plastered with children’s artwork and pictures of the kids playing or working on projects.Throughout the day, toddlers and preschoolers will pick their own activities, like building with blocks or playing at a water table, and will then talk as a group about the choices they made. They’ll have story time where the teacher will ask them questions about what they read, and opportunities to learn through play. All the teachers have bachelor’s degrees and assistant teachers have at least an associate’s degree.But a center like this, where families cannot afford to pay much, requires substantial investment of public or private money. In Cleveland, it’s taking both. Many parents at Bingham, for instance, are eligible for a scholarship from the countywide universal pre-K program, which helps families whose incomes fall below 400 percent of the federal poverty level pay a portion of preschool tuition. The county set aside $10 million for the program last year and asked the business community to match it. They ended up raising $12 million in three months.Related: Trump plan would base student loans on employability“This is a group of private investors, of corporations or wealthy families, who … understand high-quality is not inexpensive,” said Paul Clark, the regional vice president of PNC Bank, who led the fundraising effort. But “it’s not expensive when you consider the alternatives. It’s actually an incredible investment.”Evidence of the business community’s commitment to the education reforms is everywhere. The city has revamped its five career academies. In addition to teaching core academic subjects, these schools also give students a head start in different careers, such as welding, law enforcement or health services, often with hands-on-training. Educators at these five schools are partnering with businesses to provide students with experiences out in the field.A new high school is opening this week that will have a campus at a large city hospital to expose students to health care careers. An International Baccalaureate k-8 school is on Cleveland State University’s campus and works closely with the higher education institution.(Disclaimer: Development of the new high school was paid for, in part, by a grant by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which is among the numerous funders of the Hechinger Report.)These are all examples of the city’s “portfolio” approach to building its school system. As Gordon explains it, Cleveland doesn’t need 100 unique schools. It needs a few different types of schools for families to choose from and it needs them all to be high quality. That includes traditional neighborhood schools, charter schools, career academies and themed schools such as MC2 STEM High School. This school has multiple campuses, including one at the General Electric Lighting Institute, where students work with GE engineers in a yearlong mentorship program.As the name implies, the school specializes in science, math and engineering. Students are given large long-term projects that they then work on in all their classes over the course of a semester. The juniors this year had to write lyrics to and record rap songs about social ills such as gender inequality and poverty. In their government class, students talked about these issues and how they relate to the 2016 election. In English, they studied rhyme schemes. In science class, they learned about sound, and built recording booths in engineering class.Related: What happens to a high school when a transformative principal walks away?Other Cleveland students who are in schools that stimulate them say their experience helped prepare them for higher education. When he was in elementary school, Justin Alvis’ parents used to give him homework because his teachers didn’t. “There weren’t a lot of students there who were on track,” he said.So his family leapt at the chance to try a new charter school, Entrepreneurship Preparatory School, a place with “very rigorous” academics that not only gave homework every night, but required that his parents sign it once completed, Alvis said. From there he went to a prestigious private high school and is now a senior at the historically black university in Virginia, Hampton University.E Prep, as it is called, is now part of a network, Breakthrough Schools, which is working with the city to expand to 20 schools by 2020. They’ll have 12 this fall and are spending the summer recruiting 1,350 new students.But hundreds of local kids remain stuck in traditional neighborhood schools, which more often than not, remain stubbornly low-performing.“We know from the national work that turning around low performing schools is much more difficult than shuttering and starting over,” Gordon said. “It is much more difficult work to transform from within.”The district has designated 23 badly-performing schools in the city’s poorest neighborhoods as “investment schools” to overhaul. In some cases, this meant replacing entire staffs. In all the schools, the district is partnering with local groups to provide medical, mental health and social services to students there in an effort to turn them around.It’s hard to know how well that program is working, though. This spring, the state will give students its third new standardized test in three years, meaning accurately comparing results from year to year is basically impossible.The testing whiplash creates a big problem for measuring the impact of the entire plan and is on the minds of educators throughout the city. At a summer meeting of a group of 10 principals new to the profession, Gordon presented the plan and then fielded questions. The first was about how schools would be held accountable for improvement going forward. Gordon spoke about going beyond the state report card data and developing other district-specific tools.Then came the second question: “What will happen if the levy doesn’t pass?”Although Gordon and Mayor Jackson expect the levy to be renewed without a problem, he answered the question without hesitation. “The Cleveland Plan is over.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education."

Police say the driver struck the cruiser because he was distracted by the popular mobile game.The cops were standing on the sidewalk near the parked cruiser at about 3:30 a.m. when the SUV came barreling down the street and hit the police car. The SUV kept going, but the driver pulled over after realizing what had happened.An officer caught up to the driver about a block away and asked if he was all right.“That’s what I get for playing this dumb-ass game,” the driver can be heard saying.T.J. Smith, a spokesman for the city’s police department, said the driver admitted to having been playing the game on his cell phone just moments before the crash.“You can’t aimlessly wander around to play a video game,” Smith said at a press conference. “To his credit, he fully admitted his role in playing this game and we’re just fortunate.”“He had occupants in his vehicle,” he went on. “This could have easily, easily ended in tragedy. This could have easily been somebody crossing the street and struck by this vehicle.”Smith said there were no injuries reported.A word of advice: If you’re out here in these streets catching pocket monsters, please play safe."
26,QUEER VOICES,GOP Senator Slams Ben Carson's Ridiculous Claims About Trans Identity,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orrin-hatch-ben-carson-transgender_us_578f650ee4b04ca54ebf87e3,"""They’re human beings who deserve the best we can give them.”",2016-07-20,"“Of course there are people who are transgender,” Senator Hatch said in response to Ben Carson's remarks.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Senator Orrin Hatch at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, strongly disagreed with controversial remarks made by Ben Carson in which the former presidential candidate appeared to deny that transgender people exist.Carson, who’s become a major surrogate for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and delivered a speech at the RNC on Tuesday night in which he loosely tied Hillary Clinton to “Lucifer,” told Florida delegates at a breakfast on Monday that transgender identity “doesn’t make any sense” and is “the height of absurdity.” He also stated that “for thousands of years, mankind has known what a man is and what a woman is.”Carson expanded on his thoughts in an interview with The Hill newspaper, equating transgender identity to changing one’s ethnicity:“For someone to wake up and think that they belong to a different sex because they feel different that day is the same as if you woke up and said, ‘I’m Afghani today because I saw a movie about that last night, and even though my genetics might not indicate that, that’s the way I feel, and if you say that I’m not, then you’re a racist.’”When I asked GOP Senator Hatch, a conservative Mormon from Utah, to respond to Carson’s claims in an interview on SiriusXM Progress, he dismissed them outright.  “Of course there are people who are transgender,” he said. “I don’t think they choose to be that way. So, they’re human beings who deserve the best we can give them.” Hatch then referred to his state’s LGBT anti-discrimination law, passed in 2015, which was criticized by LGBT activists for allowing religious exemptions though it does provide more protections for LGBT people than have ever existed in the deeply red state. “They’re very difficult issues... very difficult issues to resolve,” Hatch said. “Utah’s done a pretty good job of that and I think our state has set a pretty good example of how you do it. [The passage of the new law] irritated people on both sides, but it was a pretty good compromise. I don’t believe we should discriminate against anyone.”"
27,TECH,Twitter's Latest Change Probably Wouldn't Have Helped Leslie Jones,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/twitter-verification-leslie-jones_us_578e67a6e4b04ca54ebef3b9,"Too little, too late, Twitter.",2016-07-19,"""Ghostbusters"" star Leslie Jones has endured a stream of racist, sexist tweets from strangers on the internet. If everyone was verified on Twitter, would there be less bullying and abuse?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578e8a8d1300002d0005ec5c.jpeg?cache=vhwksUGwhC&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twitter is making it easier to become a “verified” user, but is stopping short of creating a system to tone down harassment across the social media platform.Previously, it wasn’t clear how Twitter accounts became verified ― an exclusive feature that signals a user is really who they claim to be. A new tool, launched Tuesday, allows anyone to apply to be verified, though the company has guidelines about who qualifies. “An account may be verified if it is determined to be of public interest,” the company said in a press release. “Typically this includes accounts maintained by public figures and organizations in music, TV, film, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business, and other key interest areas.” In other words, while it’ll be easier for public figures to confirm their identities and become verified, there still isn’t a easy way for the average person to do it.Meanwhile, anyone can create anonymous Twitter accounts to harass people, which encourages “dogpiling” ― targeting individuals and flooding them with abusive messages. That very thing happened to “Ghostbusters” star Leslie Jones just Monday night. Twitter first introduced account verification in 2009 as a way to protect public figures from being impersonated. After proving their identity to the social media service, celebrities, brands, politicians, members of the media and so on can be granted little blue checkmarks next to their names to distinguish their accounts as legitimate. (You can see the checkmarks in CNBC Now’s and Jones’ tweets above.)But the path to verification has been anything but straightforward. Online FAQs previously tried to offer strategies to become verified, though nothing was concrete. Now, Twitter allows people to apply via a simple online form. Verified accounts must contain the following information ― even if it isn’t all public-facing:A verified phone numberBut, again, the social media service only intends to verify “creators and influencers.” Twitter currently offers a verified-only tab within that page, allowing you to see tweets sent from legitimate accounts ― but that’s not so useful, considering how scarce those accounts are. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new form.People might be less inclined to spew hateful sludge if their real identities were tied to their accounts. If everyone could become verified after proving their identity to Twitter, users would have an easier time filtering noise and abuse via their notifications page.Of course, as Buzzfeed’s Charlie Warzel tweeted Tuesday, verification could also embolden some trolls:Regardless, the conversation will stay theoretical for now, since verification is still reserved specifically for accounts in the “public interest” ― whatever that means."

If you ask Baton Rouge Mayor Kip Holden, as reporters from BuzzFeed did, the answer is no.“Bullshit,” Holden said, in response to claims by Baton Rouge residents that the city’s police force regularly uses discriminatory tactics in minority neighborhoods.“I’ll pay for the polygraph test,” Holden said. “They’re not stopping and frisking people at random. Just do what is expected of you and you won’t be stopped and frisked.”While there’s no doubting Holden’s convictions, his statement seems at odds with the experiences of black people who interact with the Baton Rouge police on a regular basis.Minorities are “very wary of police and often afraid of them” in Baton Rouge, Michele Fournet, a local criminal defense lawyer, told Reuters. Concerns about racially motivated policing in the city have been circulating for years. State police from New Mexico and Michigan spoke up about Baton Rouge officers’ brutal behavior toward black people after working alongside them during Hurricane Katrina. In one particularly shocking complaint relayed by the New Orleans Times-Picayune, a Michigan state trooper said a Baton Rouge officer “attempted to thank him for his help by letting him ‘beat down’ a prisoner.”After police shot Alton Sterling to death in the parking lot of a Baton Rouge convenience store earlier this month, the city’s policing standards have come under sharp scrutiny.In the weeks that followed, Baton Rouge was rocked by protests and a shooting that killed three police officers and left another three wounded, one critically.One of the officers killed in the shooting, Montrell Jackson, who was black, had written on Facebook about the struggles he faced both in uniform as a police officer and in plainclothes as a civilian.“I’m tired physically and emotionally,” he wrote. “I swear to God I love this city but I wonder if this city loves me. In uniform I get nasty hateful looks and out of uniform some consider me a threat.”“These are trying times,” he added. “Please don’t let hate infect your heart.”"

Her speech Monday contained two paragraphs that were virtually identical to passages from Michelle Obama's speech at the Democratic convention in 2008.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578e4a861300002c0005eaf6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Donald Trump’s campaign on Tuesday blamed the plagiarism in his wife’s convention speech on two favorite Republican bogeymen: the media and Hillary Clinton.“The fact that the speech itself is being focused on for … 50 words, and that includes ‘and’s’ and ‘the’s’ and things like that, is totally ignoring the facts of the speech itself,” said campaign chairman Paul Manafort at a morning news conference, accusing the media of “distorting” the would-be first lady’s remarks. “It’s just another example, as far as we’re concerned, that when Hillary Clinton is threatened by a female, the first thing she does is try to destroy the person.”A top Clinton campaign aide responded on Twitter to Manafort’s accusation that the Democratic presumptive nominee was the first to bring up the identical language. “Nice try. Not true,” wrote Jennifer Palmieri.Melania Trump’s 14-minute speech Monday night was initially well received, but was quickly criticized over two paragraphs lifted almost verbatim from first lady Michelle Obama’s speech at the Democratic nominating convention eight years ago.For example, in 2008, Michelle Obama said, “We want our children – and all children in this nation – to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.”Monday night, Melania Trump said, “We want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.”A Slovenian immigrant and Donald Trump’s third wife, Melania Trump has done few public events with her husband in his year on the trail. Manafort and other campaign supporters closed ranks overnight and early Tuesday, arguing that the criticism was overblowing the similarities between the two speeches.In a statement issued by the campaign overnight, newly hired spokesman Jason Miller said: “In writing her beautiful speech, Melania’s team of writers took notes on her life’s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking.”Trump supporter and vice-presidential finalist New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told NBC’s “Today” show that “93 percent of the speech is completely different from Michelle Obama’s speech.”Not all Republicans, though are falling in line to defend the campaign. Some privately grumble that the incident is only the latest example of an undisciplined and amateurishly run campaign unready for an undertaking as massive as a presidential general election.Even Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Tuesday that he would “probably” fire the responsible staffer were it up to him, but added that he doesn’t attribute the mistake to Melania Trump. “I don’t blame her. ... Some of these things are pretty common types of themes,” he said at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg Politics.The episode illustrates the continuing friction between the Trump campaign and the RNC, which Trump is relying on heavily to provide basic campaign functions such as fundraising and field staff.Melania Trump’s speech, nevertheless, was not vetted by the RNC, according to one official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the party’s presumptive nominee. The official added that it was not likely that anyone in the Trump campaign vetted it closely, either, given how few staffers it has.The campaign is also still not communicating fully with the RNC staff. Last week, when it became public that that Trump had filed a $10 million suit against a former staffer over a leak to a New York tabloid, the RNC learned about it the same way as the public: through media accounts. The campaign had not told the RNC about the suit, according to a second party official.The developer-turned-reality TV star will be formally nominated as the Republican presidential candidate for president Tuesday evening, and will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday night.
