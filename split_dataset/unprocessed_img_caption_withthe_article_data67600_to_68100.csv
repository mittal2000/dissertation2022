0,ENTERTAINMENT,Shopping For Happiness In The Oscar Race's Gorgeous Department Stores,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carol-brooklyn-danish-girl-production-design_us_56940d8de4b0a2b6fb711009,"The production design shines in ""Carol,"" ""Brooklyn"" and ""The Danish Girl.""",2016-01-13,"Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett star in a scene from ""Carol.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569455ee1a00002d00ab053a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Three unconventional stories of romance find an unlikely commonality in this year's Oscar contest. Beyond their crusades to score hardware amid the ongoing awards season, each movie features a central character whose prosperity can be charted through her department-store day job. In ""Carol,"" ""Brooklyn"" and ""The Danish Girl,"" these department stores serve as backdrops for three young women seeking a sense of identity. The characters feel uncomfortable in their own skin, until they discover a new piece of themselves hiding like merchandise buried on a shelf. It just so happens these turning points sprout within the walls of emporiums whose rich design underscores a significance beyond the characters' need for pink-collar paychecks.Take the 1950s-set ""Carol."" The demure Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) starts to comprehend her sexuality after selling a train set to an alluring older woman (Cate Blanchett) during the Christmas gift-buying frenzy. Said woman -- the titular Carol -- leaves her gloves behind, and after Therese mails them to her, Carol phones Therese at work and invites her to lunch. ""What a strange girl you are, flung out of space,"" Carol tells her when they reconvene -- and, with that, Therese begins to wonder what divine meaning this elusive divorcee-to-be has brought to her life. Before shooting Carol and Therese's first meeting at a fabric warehouse in Cincinnati, Judy Becker, the production designer on the Todd Haynes-directed film, conceived the showroom's aesthetics based on photographs of department stores from that time. She also examined the 1956 film ""Lovers and Lollipops,"" a naturalistic independent drama in which the characters visit a Manhattan Macy's.""What we got from that was how haphazard the toy departments were at the time,"" Becker told The Huffington Post. ""It wasn’t all beautifully arranged. That image of the cluttered toy department came from that, and also a combination of old and new, which is something we really strived to put into the toy department in 'Carol.'"" Becker, who earned an Oscar nod for designing 2013's ""American Hustle"" and also worked on ""Joy,"" noted that dilapidated display cases sat next to ones that were brand new, while junky-looking price tags and untidy shelves were complimented by ""beautiful"" elevators. That juxtaposition doubles as a reflection of the post-World War II, pre-Eisenhower era, when global chaos was settling into domestic peace. The back entrance to the store in ""Carol,"" where employees clock in, was made to feel ""almost Soviet"" in its rigidity, emphasizing that Mara's character feels trapped by a job she hates. When we see Therese outside of work, especially as her liaison with Carol evolves, the movie's tint is more inviting.If ""Carol"" uses a graininess to mark Therese's bleak outlook on her professional and romantic life, the stores in ""Brooklyn"" and ""The Danish Girl"" employ golden hues that glisten with their characters' budding contentment.The coming-of-age ode ""Brooklyn,"" directed by John Crowley and also set in the 1950s, revolves around Eilis Lacey, an Irish immigrant (Saoirse Ronan) who sets sail for New York in search of more promising professional prospects. Homesickness sets in instantly, and upon starting work at a posh department store, a despondent Eilis is scolded by her supervisor (Jessica Paré) for not being friendlier to customers. She meets a charming, impossibly kind suitor (Emory Cohen) who inspires in Eilis a newfound optimism. Suddenly, her idea of home expands to New York, and her demeanor shifts as a result. Eilis smiles more and engages with patrons, and suddenly those gilded hues seem to sparkle a bit more radiantly. ""Brooklyn"" production designer François Séguin scouted locations to find a site with lighting that paired warmth and elegance. Shot at a historical library in Ireland, the movie's department store is bathed in natural light thanks to a ""massive"" window. A sense of comfort portends the happiness that Eilis will encounter, giving the store certain romantic underpinnings. Its color scheme is the most benevolent of the three because Eilis faces the least outward adversity.The same effect occurs in ""The Danish Girl,"" Tom Hooper's 1920s-set portrait of real-life artist Lili Elbe, the first person to undergo successful gender-confirmation surgery. The entire movie looks like a lush painting, but its canvas is often punctuated with grays that reflect the confusion Lili experiences as a result of being born into a man's body. After she begins to dress in traditionally female clothing full-time, Lili acquires a job at an opulent women's store -- the ""absolute best moment of her life,"" as ""Danish Girl"" production designer Eve Stewart described it, recalling evidence from Elbe's published diaries. Amid the roaring fashion scene in 1920s Paris, Lili's employment at such an upscale shop placed her in an epicenter of wealth, as well as a token of refreshing liberation for women. For someone consciously asserting her femininity after disguising it for so long, Lili blossoms in the job, as exhibited in a scene where she joyfully instructs a customer that a ""lady"" would apply perfume via mere spritz. ""Voila,"" Lili chirps after demonstrating. The ""Danish Girl"" crew had one day to shoot the scene at an art-deco hotel in London, which Stewart said she dressed to look even more elaborate than what's portrayed in the film -- a world-building effect she learned from working with director Mike Leigh on ""Topsy-Turvy,"" ""All or Nothing"" and ""Vera Drake.""Stewart, a three-time Oscar nominee, sees the department-store sequence as Lili's ""'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' moment, like it's full of candy."" At last, Lili has the fortitude to present herself as a full-fledged woman. The character's escalating confidence is on display in a manner far more flagrant than the implicit euphoria of Therese's encounter with Carol or the satisfaction that mounts as Eilis' homesickness fades.Each of these movies tells a story of unexpected romance -- that of two lesbians in the cloistered 1950s, a transgender artist who loves her wife but must exact her true identity, and a lonely immigrant who rediscovers the meaning of home thanks to a new admirer. At the center of the three characters' self-discovery, these department stores confirm that what once seemed mundane, or even claustrophobic, can become marvelous.Sure, significant others help Therese, Eilis and Lili to realize themselves. But what really brings them to life is the actualization of an existence they've long buried -- lives that society and their families would rather them not enact. When they are happy with themselves, everything seems a bit more golden. ""Carol,"" ""Brooklyn"" and ""The Danish Girl"" are currently in theaters. The Oscars are Feb. 28. Also on HuffPost:"

He was brought on to ""Saturday Night Live"" in 2005 after online shorts he produced with some friends (The Lonely Island, you might know them?) gained notoriety on YouTube. That talent was parlayed into ""SNL"" Digital Shorts, quick, catchy songs and skits that were perfectly primed for the rise of easily shareable content. Because of this, he's never really been in the public eye without thousands of critics and commenters tracking his every move.""That’s part of the job now,"" Samberg told The Huffington Post, calling in on a lunch break while filming Fox's ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine."" Since we're in the thick of awards season we wanted to ask the one-time Emmy host what he thought of helming a huge show during the live-tweeting age we live in. ""It's harder to do anything in the public eye now, in terms of if you’re worried about scrutiny or being judged negatively,"" Samberg said. ""It’s not as much of a free ride. If you’re someone who’s making film or TV or music, or any kind of art form now, there’s a billion outlets and they all have an opinion."" The equalizing nature of the Internet, where everyone can have an opinion and easily access millions more, has certainly changed the way we consume and discuss entertainment. ""When I go home for the holidays, everyone in my family’s talking about, like, ‘What’d you think of “Carol”?’ Well, it was no 'Mad Max,'"" Samberg noted. ""Why is my aunt talking about this? I didn’t know she cared about this stuff."" As for his Emmy hosting gig, Samberg teamed up with the writing staff of ""Comedy Bang! Bang!"" ""I got to hang out with them for a couple weeks and just write stupid jokes about television. I can’t think of a way I’d rather spend my time,"" he said.And despite the potential scrutiny, it's a part of fame to which Samberg's willing to concede. ""It evolves, just like everything else evolves, and as long as I get to be doing what I love, which is making comedy and that kind of thing, I feel lucky that I get to,"" he said. Samberg's been keeping busy doing just that, having reprised his role as Jonathan, the once-hapless backpacker who now has Dracula as his father-in-law, in 2015's ""Hotel Transylvania 2."" ""With animation, I somehow manage to go even more over-the top than I do in live action,"" Samberg said of his process. ""I often will just chug a bunch of coffee and go to town for a couple hours.""Plus, providing just the voice of a character offers a little more freedom. ""It also really protects you as a performer because you get a million chances to do it,"" he said, noting the spaces of time that occur between sessions. ""If you do something that didn’t work, you get a second or third or fourth shot at it.""""Hotel Transylvania 2"" is available on DVD. ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on Fox.Also on HuffPost:"
2,BUSINESS,One Way Bernie Sanders Thinks He Could Stave Off Another Financial Crisis,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-credit-rating-agency-reform-plan_us_56955d02e4b086bc1cd57afd,He wants to end a conflict of interest in how debt is rated.,2016-01-13,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed several reforms to finance, including a way to change how credit ratings agencies do business.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When you're running for president on a platform of universal health care, free college and breaking up the big banks, pretty much everything else seems small bore.And so it was last week when Bernie Sanders laid out his financial reform plan, which included a proposal to turn the credit rating agencies into nonprofits and remove their conflict of interest.The goals of the plan were clear, but specifics absent. The Sanders campaign provided more detailed points about how exactly he plans to overhaul companies that had said before the 2008 recession that tens of thousands of mortgage securities had basically no risk of default. (Those mortgage bonds were in fact risky enough that their fall in value triggered a global financial crisis.)Under the Vermont senator's plan, instead of issuers being able to choose which agency rates their debt based on who they think would give it the best rating, the ratings agencies' work would be assigned by an independent investor board, Sanders' senior policy advisor Warren Gunnels told The Huffington Post. The members of the board would be picked by the Securities and Exchange Commission. And while a Sanders' administration couldn't directly control who the SEC picked, Gunnels said he envisioned the board being made up of representatives from pensions, mutual funds and organized labor. The transition of the ratings agencies to nonprofit entities would be phased in over two years. Eventually, ratings agencies would be funded by a fee paid by issuers and collected by the federal government. Gunnels said an SEC rule-making process would decide the precise amount of the fee and how it would be collected. Congress has tried to reform the credit rating agencies before, and the outcome shows how uninterested the SEC is in aggressively pursuing the issue. In 2010, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken (D) got a provision requiring securities to be randomly assigned to raters included in the version of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill the Senate passed. It also called for more business to be directed toward the rating agencies that got their ratings right.That provision was watered down to simply asking the SEC to examine the issue, which it took more than two years to years to do, before waiting another two years to roll out ineffectual new rules. In response to Sanders' proposal, Franken, who has endorsed Hillary Clinton, told The Intercept, ""The financial stability of millions of hardworking Americans remains at risk because the Securities and Exchange Commission still hasn’t moved to implement my reform measure to clean up credit ratings agencies.""Standard & Poor's and Moody's declined to comment. Fitch did not respond to a request for comment."
3,POLITICS,Looks Like Justice Scalia Won't Be Saving Public-Sector Unions After All,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scalia-public-unions-friedrichs_us_56956a7ae4b086bc1cd5931e,Union advocates had hoped the conservative justice would lend them a hand in a big labor case.,2016-01-13,"In a 1991 case, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia explained why requiring nonunion members to pay union dues could be reconciled with First Amendment rights. In oral arguments for Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association this week, he has seemed skeptical of this position.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56956b712a00002d00030540.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Public unions clearly appeared to have taken a beating Monday during oral arguments in a major case the Supreme Court is considering.As much as they tried, the lawyers supporting unions in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association couldn't seem to convince a majority of the justices that collecting so-called ""fair-share"" or agency fees from nonunion workers does not violate the First Amendment.But perhaps most disappointing for labor advocates is that one potential ally going into the hearing, Justice Antonin Scalia, turned out to be no ally at all.""The problem is that everything that is collectively bargained with the government is within the political sphere, almost by definition,"" Scalia told Edward Dumont, the California solicitor general who argued on behalf of public unions.""Should the government pay higher wages or lesser wages? Should it promote teachers on the basis of seniority?"" he asked. ""All of those questions are necessarily political questions. That's ­the major argument made by the other side.""That charge -- that agency fees violate nonunion workers' free-speech rights -- could undo a nearly 40-year-old precedent that said precisely the opposite: that collecting the fees is ""constitutionally justified.""Scalia was considered a possible wildcard vote in favor of the fees because of statements he has made in other politically charged disputes raising similar issues as Friedrichs.In one 1991 labor case, for example, Scalia explained very compellingly why the ""free rider"" problem posed by nonpaying nonunion workers could be easily reconciled with First Amendment concerns.""Where the state imposes upon the union a duty to deliver services, it may permit the union to demand reimbursement for them,"" Scalia wrote, ""or, looked at from the other end, where the state creates in the nonmembers a legal entitlement from the union, it may compel them to pay the cost.""Scalia called this a ""constitutional rule"" aimed at the ""elimination of the inequity arising from the fact that some union activity redounds to the benefit of free-riding nonmembers.""He reasoned that free-ridership existed because labor law itself created it. And thus, the law ""requires the union to carry"" and ""to go out of its way to benefit"" these nonunion workers, ""even at the expense of its other interests.""Scalia went on: ""In the context of bargaining, a union must seek to further the interests of its nonmembers; it cannot, for example, negotiate particularly high wage increases for its members in exchange for accepting no increases for others.""Lofty and comforting words for public unions. But all of them appeared relegated to history during the Friedrichs hearing on Monday, with Scalia sounding every bit as skeptical as his conservative colleagues of the unions' arguments for collecting fees from nonmembers.At one point, he even suggested that ""a change of the rule"" that has prevailed for nearly 40 years in these labor cases may be the way to go moving forward.Something must have changed since 1991 if Scalia indeed ends up reversing course."

I'm very concerned about him -- having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his -- his visceral response to attack people on their appearance -- short, tall, fat, ugly -- my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?So it's an open question as to whether Paul -- whose concerns about Trump's juvenility and his ability to contain himself from unleashing America's nuclear arsenal earned him the response, ""Yeah, but your dumb face, though"" -- could possibly support a candidate who promises to entirely dispense with the libertarian philosophies that have long been essential to Rand's brand. Or, it was an open question, until he was asked about it Wednesday. Per Politico:Sen. Rand Paul hesitantly conceded that he would support Donald Trump in the general election if the real estate mogul were to win the Republican nomination.Sure, man, you know, when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one candidate to throw his support behind a guy he loathes utterly, you know, I think it would have to happen. Stirring stuff.Paul, of course, is still pretty sure that Trump won't be the nominee. ""I think there's a very good chance that Trump doesn't win in Iowa,"" he said, adding, ""I think that the veneer comes off, and I think he'll struggle in New Hampshire as well.""So a couple of things are clear. One is that Rand Paul reads Vox. But a second, and perhaps more pertinent thing to all of Trump's opponents in the GOP field, is that it was vastly silly for Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to have bound all of his candidates to a pledge to support the eventual nominee -- a move that was deemed to be required solely because of Trump's candidacy. Had Trump not been part of the field, it wouldn't have been necessary for Priebus to check with everyone and ask whether they'd be supportive of their party's nominee.Sure, the idea at the time was that a possible independent run from Trump could pose an existential threat to the GOP's hopes to win the White House -- a concern that this ""pledge"" nominally put in check. But when Trump signed on, he claimed a deal breaker for himself (the vague demand that he be ""treated fairly"") which essentially voided the spirit of the pledge right from the start. Now, as Trump's own campaign is doing damage to the primary means by which he'd gather the financial resources no self-fund an independent run -- the ephemeral market perception of his brand name among ""high-end consumers"" -- it's looking more and more like Priebus should have called his bluff.But it's more startling to see Paul greet the prospect of standing behind his hated rival with such diffidence. After all, Paul himself is not a part of the ""GOP establishment"" and the voters that form the base of his support would likely find it inspiring for Paul to break from this pledge on principle.

Rick Snyder (R) has called in the National Guard to help hand out bottled water in Flint, where dangerous lead levels have made municipal water unsafe to drink.National Guard troops could arrive in Flint as soon as Wednesday morning, Snyder spokesman Dave Murray said in an email. ""The support of the National Guard will enable American Red Cross volunteers, who have been staffing the water resource sites since Jan. 9, to join the efforts of the water resource teams going door to door in Flint neighborhoods to distribute bottled water, water filters, replacement cartridges and testing kits,"" Murray said.The water resource sites are places in Flint where residents have been able to pick up bottled water and filters. The governor's office said Sunday that state troopers would help distribute water door to door. The water problems started in 2014, when emergency managers appointed by Snyder oversaw the city's switch to the Flint River as its water source. The state failed to ensure treatment to prevent the new water from corroding the city's aging pipes, many of which contain lead.State officials downplayed the risks until a local pediatrician reported elevated lead levels in Flint kids' blood at the end of September. Lead poisoning can have lifetime consequences for children, including stunted growth and diminished IQs. Snyder's response to the water crisis has continuously escalated since October, when the state admitted it had made mistakes that led to high levels of the deadly neurotoxin in Flint's water. That month, Snyder created a task force to investigate what went wrong, and approved switching the city back to Detroit's water system. In December, Snyder apologized for the toxic water and accepted resignations of several officials.Last week Snyder declared a state of emergency in Genesee County, which surrounds Flint, and this week he created a second task force to work on solutions for the city's long-term water woes.

8,POLITICS,Here's Every Line That Kim Davis Applauded At The State Of The Union,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-davis-applaue-lines-sotu_us_5695c0e1e4b05b3245db19e6,There weren't many.,2016-01-13,Kim Davis attended the State of the Union Tuesday night. She did not clap much.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5695d1d21a00002d00ab06cb.jpeg?cache=3P8DDx3Vt2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kim Davis didn't find much she could applaud Tuesday night during President Barack Obama's final State of the Union. But she did find a few things.Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, applauded the president just four times and was frequently one of the few members of the audience who, Republican or Democrat, sat stoically during the biggest lines. Who invited her to the address was a mystery for most of the day Tuesday. Turns out it was House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who didn't even know he had invited her until The Huffington Post asked him about it.As for the clapping, Davis did applaud when the Senate entered the chamber, which was the only group she clapped for upon their introduction. (She was one of the few audience members to not clap when the Sergeant-at-Arms announced Obama.)For a good chunk of the start of the speech, Davis avoided applauding for Obama at all. She sat through lines on a strong economy, job creation, even delivering benefits to veterans -- all of which drew ovations from many Republicans.But the line that broke her no-clapping streak was this: ""I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there’s red tape that needs to be cut,"" Obama said.Republicans cheered. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) shouted in approval. Kim Davis golf clapped. (One.)The next line that got Davis was perhaps Obama's biggest of the night. ""Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world,"" he said. There was a standing ovation on the House floor. There was a calm, calculated applause from Davis. (Two.)She sat through some other big lines that garnered ovations. When Obama called for making America the country that cures cancer, Davis was still. When Obama said America was on track to end HIV and AIDS, Davis -- perhaps predictably -- didn't applaud. She didn't clap for stopping the spread of Ebola, she didn't clap for the space program, and she didn't clap for reducing the influence of money in politics.But Davis did applaud going after terrorists. (Three.) And she clapped twice -- but just twice -- at a line that was almost written for her. ""We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion,"" Obama said.

9,MEDIA,NBC Exec Says Outrage Over Trump's 'SNL' Appearance Worth The Ratings,Gabriel Arana,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nbc-trump-snl-ratings_us_5696c194e4b0b4eb759d0b68,Bob Greenblatt downplayed the reality TV star's racist remarks against immigrants.,2016-01-13,"Donald Trump on ""Saturday Night Live"" in November.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5696c30e1a00002d00ab07f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NBC has no shame.At a panel hosted by the Television Critics Association Wednesday, NBC Entertainment Chief Bob Greenblatt said he had no regrets about allowing Donald Trump to host “Saturday Night Live” last year.As The Wrap’s Daniel Halloway first reported, Greenblatt was asked whether the episode’s high ratings were worth the controversy Trump’s appearance generated.“I think it was,” he said. “At the end of the day, he was on the show for 11 minutes, and as I like to say, the Earth didn’t fall off its axis.”Trump’s appearance on the network followed controversial remarks in which the Republican presidential candidate called Latino immigrants “rapists” and “criminals.” The statements initially led NBC to sever its ties with Trump, including a lucrative partnership with the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants. Then the network invited the GOP presidential contender to appear on “SNL,” causing outrage among members of the Latino community and prompting the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to pen a letter asking NBC to reverse its decision.Greenblatt seems to think Trump’s remarks about Hispanics, like his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the country, amount to little more than a political disagreement.“We’re not in business with him, but love it or not he’s one of the most political figures of our time, and he’s on our shows,” Greenblatt said. “I think that if we were in the business of never having any one guest on the network who had views that disagreed with our views, we would be out of business.”Perhaps Greenblatt’s tone-deaf comments shouldn’t be a surprise given the network’s history on the issue. In a November meeting meant to assuage members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, NBC News President Deborah Turness enraged lawmakers by referring to undocumented immigrants as “illegals,” then pandering to those present by saying, “Yo hablo español -- we love the Hispanic community.”NBC declined to comment further on the matter Wednesday."

[By TV standards] if you are anywhere above a size two, you're not having sex. You don't have sexual thoughts. You may not even have a vagina. And if you're of a certain age, you're off the table.Throughout her career, Davis has continually spoken out against sexism and racism in Hollywood. During her acceptance speech at the 2015 Emmys for her role in ""How To Get Away With Murder"" Davis highlighted the importance of show creators writing roles for women of color.""Let me tell you something: The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity,"" she said. ""You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there. So here’s to all the writers, the awesome people that are Ben Sherwood, Paul Lee, Peter Nowalk, Shonda Rhimes, people who have redefined what it means to be beautiful, to be sexy, to be a leading woman, to be black.""

Paul LePage (R) may skip his annual State of the State address to the legislature, saying he has no interest in speaking to a bunch of people who want to impeach him. ""Why am I going to go up and face people and talk to them in an audience that just a week or two before, they’re trying to impeach me? That's just silliness,"" LePage told Bangor radio station WVOM Tuesday. ""I'll send them a letter and we'll call it a day.""LePage's office did not return a request for comment about whether he is definitely canceling this year's State of the State address. A group of Maine lawmakers have drafted a motion to set up an investigation into whether LePage should be impeached, which the legislature could take up as early as Thursday. Their complaints center around whether the governor bullied an organization into revoking a job for the Democratic House speaker by threatening to withhold state funds for the group. Governors traditionally use their high-profile State of the State speeches to tout successes and outline policy priorities for the new year, much like the president does in a State of the Union address. LePage usually delivers his State of the State speech in late January or early February.Republican legislators told the Portland Press Herald they understand why LePage might want to break with tradition this year. ""Look, he's got the Democratic speaker of the House suing him in federal court, he’s got nine [lawmakers] in the House bringing impeachment against him,"" House GOP leader Kenneth Fredette said. ""Not coming in and not addressing the Legislature in that atmosphere is certainly a reasonable action.""State House Speaker Mark Eves (D), who is the one suing LePage over his lost job, said the governor would be doing the people of Maine a disservice by skipping his speech.""Hard working people of Maine show up to do their jobs, and the governor should do his,"" Eves said in a statement. ""Maine people deserve to hear the governor's vision for the state and his proposed solutions.""LePage has also been dealing with intense criticism for his recent assertion that heroin dealers with names like ""D-Money"" like to come to Maine and ""impregnate a young white girl before they leave.""At a press conference Friday, LePage insisted that his comments were not about race because he hadn't specified whether ""D-Money"" and the other hypothetical drug dealers were black or white. ""I never said anything about white or black on traffickers ... What are they, black? I don't know. I just read the names,"" LePage said. ""I tried to explain that Maine is essentially all white. I should have said 'Maine women.'""Also on HuffPost:"

Administration officials told the Times that as many as 9,000 people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras might be able to come to the U.S. under the program, while some would go to other countries in the region.The U.S. will also work with UNHCR to create processing centers in neighboring countries, according to the New York Times report. UNHCR screens people around the world for eligibility for refugee resettlement, but those referred to the United States are also vetted by the U.S. government.The U.S. already planned to admit 85,000 refugees from around the world this fiscal year, up from 70,000 last year. Only 3,000 spots were allocated for Latin America and the Caribbean, though the figures also factor in 6,000 unallocated openings for refugees. Kerry did not specify how the new plan would affect that figure.A Department of State spokesman said it is not raising the overall number of admissions for the fiscal year. The news comes after more than three-quarters of the House Democratic caucus signed onto a letter asking the president to suspend recent deportation raids on families ordered for removal, and do more to help vulnerable Central Americans. Many critics have accused the administration of a hemispheric bias in refugee response -- willing to fight for bringing in more Syrians and others from the Middle East, but focusing more on keeping Central Americans from coming to the U.S.The 146 House Democrats wrote that they commend the administration for upholding ""time-honored American values by offering refuge to those fleeing violence and disorder in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.""""However, these same fundamental American values have not been applied in your administration's policies towards Central American refugee mothers and children. ... Rather than preserving our commitment to refugee protection, your administration continues to pursue policies that treat Central American refugees as an immigration enforcement matter,"" they wrote. The Democrats also called in their letter for the administration to work with the United Nations to screen refugees for resettlement in the U.S. and other countries, and for people already here to be eligible for temporary protected status that would allow them to stay. The efforts at deterrence, at least so far, do not seem to be working. Although the number of Central American families and unaccompanied minors seeking refuge in the U.S went down following a spike in 2014, they're rising again, which many experts attribute to the ongoing instability in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. The homicide rate in El Salvador spiked last year, putting the country on track to pass Honduras, which has been coined the homicide capital of the world. Customs and Border Protection agents apprehended about 21,500 family units over the past three months, compared to about 7,500 in the same period the year before. Agents also picked up about 17,400 unaccompanied minors in October, November and December of last year. They apprehended about 8,000 children traveling without their parents, during the same months the year before.The Obama administration already launched some efforts to improve conditions in Central America. The president requested $1 billion last year in aid for Central America, and Congress allocated $750 million.The State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced plans in November 2014 for an in-country processing system in Central America for parents lawfully present in the U.S. to apply for their children to join them here, meant to discourage minors from arriving without authorization.Processing, however, has moved slowly. Critics have slammed a policy that requires minors to remain in dangerous Central American countries for long periods before approvals. Nearly a year after the program was announced, not a single person had used it to come to the U.S., and only 90 of nearly 4,000 applicants had been interviewed. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on current figures detailing how many Central American minors have been approved for the program. According to the non-governmental organization U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, only five children arrived in the program's first year. Stacie Blake, who leads the group's government relations efforts, said they are concerned about the processing speeds of the newly-announced refugee screening efforts. ""A sense of urgency is needed,"" she said in an email. ""Women and children are running for their lives. A policy or plan with no urgency will not protect vulnerable people running for their lives.""Kerry's announcement on Wednesday didn't end criticism of the administration's deportation raids. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) said in a statement to HuffPost that a refugee processing center in Central America ""is an important step in recognizing that this hemispheric humanitarian crisis merits a comprehensive approach"" and that he looked forward to seeing more details.""At the same time, we must immediately halt domestic immigration raids that fast-track the deportations of the very same families we are hoping to aid with today’s announcement, especially if they have not been granted access to legal counsel or meaningful due process,"" Menendez added. ""As a nation which prides itself in treating refugees appropriately and according to international standards, we must lead all efforts that create security, peace and safety for these children and families.""Later in the day, President Barack Obama approved up to $70 million in additional funding for the refugee admissions program worldwide -- not exclusively for Central America -- ""for the purpose of meeting unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs ... in light of the unprecedented number of refugees in need of resettlement,"" according to a memo he sent to Kerry.This story has been updated with a comment from Sen.

Add to that Obama's top staffer now offering kind words about Haley, and you can imagine that some conservatives' heads may be about to explode.McDonough said he didn't actually see Haley's speech, but read it later and ""wasn't surprised"" by her calls for more inclusion.""By no means am I trying to endorse everything that she's doing,"" he said.

The White House Wants To Find Them.,Arthur Delaney and Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-fighting-poverty_us_56966557e4b086bc1cd60295,The big idea is to help people quickly.,2016-01-13,"Shaun Donovan, director of the Office of Management and Budget, previewed the new anti-poverty proposal on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_13_354_4004_1762%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration wants to spend $2 billion testing new approaches to fighting poverty, with a particular focus on catching people before they fall into crisis rather than trying to put them back on their feet afterward.The president's budget, which will be officially released in early February, calls for creating a new Emergency Aid and Service Connection. The main goal would be to find ways of helping families who face immediate, potentially crippling financial crises -- like a car breaking down with no money for repairs or an extended absence from work because of illness. Instead of waiting for these people to exhaust all resources, certifying their poverty with extensive paperwork and then providing them with assistance through programs like food stamps, the idea would be to assist them with quick short-term aid -- before one crisis leads to many others -- or connect them with programs that, over the long term, can help stabilize their incomes.The Emergency Aid and Service Connection would make money available to states and nonprofits interested in trying such approaches -- and then evaluate how those programs worked, in hopes of hitting upon a few truly effective methods. ""We want to work with state and local communities ... that could then customize exactly that kind of response,"" Shaun Donovan, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said on Wednesday. ""Nobody has a monopoly on the best ideas."" Donovan made his remarks during an event held at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University and moderated by sociology professor Kathryn Edin. That was no coincidence. A senior administration official told The Huffington Post that a major inspiration for the president's initiative was the ""groundbreaking"" research that Edin conducted with H. Luke Shaefer, a social scientist at the University of Michigan. Their 2015 book, Two Dollars a Day, focused on the extremely poor -- a group whose ranks have been increasing -- and the ways that short-term financial crises can unravel lives.Most of the extremely poor people they talked to ""had been working -- and wanted to work -- but because of the instability in their jobs and the instability in their family lives, they had lost a job and things had spiraled out of control from there,"" Shaefer told HuffPost last fall. A mother with kids might move in with other family members after losing a job, Shaefer explained, only to have a relative borrow her car and wreck it or, worse, commit some kind of abuse. ""We found a lot of examples where these people had turned to families and friends for help, and it turned out really badly,"" Shaefer said.One reason these Americans are struggling, Edin and Shaefer found, is that the safety net for poor families has become a shadow of its former self. Welfare reform, passed in 1996, has drastically shrunk the percentage of poor families who receive cash benefits. The prospects for new anti-poverty spending might seem grim, given that President Barack Obama is in his final year of office and Republicans, who generally oppose new spending, control Congress. But some prominent Republicans, most notably House Speaker Paul Ryan, have spoken frequently and conspicuously about their interest in finding innovative approaches to fighting poverty. A one-time expenditure of $2 billion is not a huge sum in the context of a nearly $4 trillion federal budget, and finding at least some money for testing out promising programs might be possible. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, Obama went out of his way to praise Ryan's attention to poverty. ""America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support,"" Obama said. "

20,MEDIA,Al Jazeera America To Shut Down By End Of April,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/al-jazeera-america-to-shut-down_us_5696a615e4b0b4eb759cdead,"“It’s journalism, so everything’s unstable and you kind of roll with it,” said one staffer. “But there was no indication that this sort of thing was coming.”",2016-01-13,"Over 600 employees were on board for the launch of Al Jazeera America, which is ending its run after less than 2 1/2 years.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Al Jazeera America will shut down its operations in the United States by the end of April, the company told employees in a meeting on Wednesday.Al Jazeera America President Kate O’Brian tearfully relayed the news to stunned colleagues, alongside CEO Al Anstey. In a memo to staff, Anstey said the decision was driven by the “fact that our business model is simply not sustainable in an increasingly digital world, and because of the current global financial challenges.”That Anstey framed the decision as a business move was striking, since the Qatar-backed Al Jazeera Media Network seemed more motivated to expand its global influence through a U.S. cable network than it did to turn a profit, especially in the short term. After disrupting Arab-language media in the 1990s and extending its international footprint the following decade through Al Jazeera English, the parent company spared no expense to break into the U.S. market. It could presumably afford to, with crude oil prices around $105 a barrel at the time of its August 2013 launch -- though they have since dropped to $30 a barrel. Despite receiving plaudits for its English-language coverage of the 2011 Arab Spring protests, including from prominent American politicians, the company struggled to get its channel on the cable dial. To some, Al Jazeera's image had been shaped during the Bush years, when officials blasted the Arab-language channel’s airing of Osama bin Laden videos in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. The media company launched a campaign to get Al Jazeera English distributed on U.S. cable providers, and eventually tried buying its way in. It spent $500 million to buy Current TV, a progressive network launched by former Vice President Al Gore, and replaced it with a new U.S. channel that would eventually reach 60 million homes. Al Jazeera then built a midtown Manhattan studio and hired over 600 employees for the venture, including executives from rival broadcast and cable networks and established TV anchors. Some inside Al Jazeera expressed concern to The Huffington Post ahead of the channel's August 2013 launch that executives were trying to imitate existing U.S. cable news channels and that Al Jazeera America wouldn't distinguish itself from the pack, as Al Jazeera English had done in its coverage of the protests across the Middle East and North Africa. ""If they play it safe, they’re doomed,” Philip Seib, author of a book on Al Jazeera's global influence, said at the time. “No one’s going to pay attention to them.”Still, Al Jazeera America won awards and admirers in the media world, and some prominent journalists lamented Wednesday's announcement. Some journalists tweeted that the launch of Al Jazeera America took away from Al Jazeera English -- which was already an influential, highly regarded news brand accessible to U.S. consumers online prior to the cable channel's launch. The decision to shut down Al Jazeera America comes just weeks after the channel aired what was perhaps its most-publicized report, linking Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning to performance-enhancing drugs. Manning threatened to sue, while two other athletes who were mentioned in the report -- baseball stars Ryan Howard and Ryan Zimmerman -- did file suits against the network. Despite some Al Jazeera America stories breaking through the noisy cable news world, the channel as a whole never did. Ratings remained anemic over two years into the venture, with audiences hovering around 30,000 viewers. And Al Jazeera America’s trouble building a significant audience was compounded by allegations of sexism and anti-Semitism from former employees and claims that a ""culture of fear"" existed inside the network. The parent company also laid off hundreds of employees outside the U.S. last fall, a move The Guardian suggested was tied to falling oil prices. Yet top executives expressed optimism just months ago. In November, Anstey dismissed speculation that the company might pull the plug on the U.S. channel. “There is a clear picture of where we are going to go,” he told Variety.Anstey said in that interview that Al Jazeera America was prioritizing quality news programming, not ratings, and that “it’s going to take time to build viewership.” He said the network’s parent company had a “long-term commitment” to keep it running. In addition to shutting down Al Jazeera America, the company announced Wednesday that it would expand existing international digital services and the digital platform AJ+, which it touted as having reached more than 2 billion online video views since launching in September 2014. Al Jazeera America digital staffers voted to unionize in October, part of a trend for digital media workers.An Al Jazeera America staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the network can unilaterally decide what to offer non-unionized employees with respect to severance, but must negotiate with the roughly 50 staffers represented by the NewsGuild of New York over the terms of their termination. Several hundred employees overall will lose their jobs when the network shuts down in April. “It’s journalism, so everything’s unstable and you kind of roll with it,” the staffer said. “But there was no indication that this sort of thing was coming.”Gabriel Arana contributed reporting.

Catholic Colleges Are Fighting Them.,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/catholic-colleges-adjuncts-unions_us_56942dc0e4b09dbb4bac4f84,"As adjuncts organize, Catholic schools are seeking religious exemptions from labor law. Professors say the schools are violating their own core principles.",2016-01-13,Alyson Paige Warren is an adjunct professor at Loyola University of Chicago. The school has opposed a unionization campaign by Warren and her colleagues.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569430411a00002e00ab0512.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Joseph Fahey cherishes the Catholic Church's teachings on worker rights. ""It's really beautiful teaching -- rock-bottom core, Matthew 25 stuff,"" says Fahey, a Catholic theologian. ""A lot of Catholics would tell you that's why they're Catholic.""So Fahey took it as an insult to his faith when the Catholic school where he's taught for 50 years, Manhattan College, tried to prevent adjunct professors from unionizing. He was particularly galled because part-time adjuncts are among ""the poorest and weakest people on campus,"" he says. In September, he dashed off a public letter on the matter, saying the school's trustees should be ashamed of themselves. ""This falls into the context of grave sin. This is serious stuff,"" Fahey, 76, told The Huffington Post. ""They're violating their own mission statement that says the school is supposed to stand up for social justice. If they violate this [teaching], they may as well not call themselves a Catholic school.""Manhattan is one of a gaggle of Catholic colleges now holding up their spiritual mission as a shield against collective bargaining. At least four other schools -- Seattle University; Duquesne University, in Pittsburgh; Saint Xavier University, in Chicago; and Loyola University Chicago -- have recently sought religious exemptions from labor law that would scuttle faculty organizing campaigns.Since at least the late 1800s, Catholic social teaching has recognized collective bargaining as a tool for social justice. Adjuncts and their allies say the schools are flouting Catholic principles by trying to deny teachers a path to join unions, particularly as Pope Francis rails against income inequality. The schools claim they are merely protecting themselves from government intrusion.""It does make them squirm,"" said Daniel Kovalik, a lawyer for the United Steelworkers union, which has been organizing adjuncts at Duquesne. ""If you look at their arguments on those issues, they're in a box. Going back to Pope Leo XIII, the Catholic Church has encouraged employers to recognize unions. With Pope Francis, it's even more embarrassing to take a position counter to that.""In a statement to HuffPost, Manhattan said its adjuncts play an ""indispensable role"" at the school, but it must be able to manage its relationship with them ""free of [government] oversight."" ""We believe that it would be irresponsible not to question vigorously the right of the government to insert itself into decisions that directly affect the heart and soul of our institution, not because of opposition to employees or antipathy to the rights of working people,"" the college said.Critics of that stance quickly point to Rerum Novarum, the encyclical on capital and labor issued by Pope Leo XIII. In this 1891 open letter to the Catholic bishops, the pope offered a few prescriptions for alleviating the ""misery and wretchedness"" he saw among the working classes of the Gilded Age. Near the top of his list was the right to free association with groups that can close the gap between rich and poor. ""The most important of all are workingmen's unions,"" the pope wrote.Just six years ago, in his encyclical Caritas in Veritate, Pope Benedict XVI wrote that his predecessor's appeal for unionism was even more relevant in an age of globalization. Unions, the pope said, were becoming too weak to effectively advocate for the working class. Calls to promote collective bargaining, Benedict urged, ""must therefore be honored today even more than in the past.""Such texts aren't convenient to Catholic schools looking to stymie union campaigns, said Gerald Beyer, an associate theology professor at Villanova University who specializes in Catholic social ethics. Beyer recently penned a journal article in which he argued that Catholic universities have ""no legitimate reason"" for opposing the unionization efforts of their adjuncts, particularly by trying to stake out a religious exemption. If the schools want to avoid government involvement, he notes, they can simply recognize the unions through card check, a process that doesn't require going through the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that oversees union elections. At stake, Beyer told HuffPost, is much more than a few isolated labor disputes.""If we fail to model the values of Catholic tradition, then we say it's OK to violate it when we don't want to make the necessary commitment,"" Beyer said. ""This [tactic] -- using legal recourse to thwart adjunct unions -- sows confusion and runs the risk of causing scandal. It cheapens the Church's witness to the gospel."" Over the years, U.S. colleges have come to rely on cheap adjuncts to keep costs down. Unlike tenured professors, adjuncts have no guarantee on their courses from year to year. The pay can be paltry and the benefits non-existent, forcing teachers to work at several different schools at once. The treatment of adjuncts became a national story after the sad death of Margaret Mary Vojtko, a longtime French adjunct professor at Duquesne.The discontent among many faculty members has made college classrooms fertile organizing territory for unions. More than 20,000 adjuncts, tenure-track professors and graduate student employees have unionized at more than 70 private and public schools since the start of 2012, according to William A. Herbert, director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College, CUNY. ""One element that permeates a lot of these cases is [the idea of] respect, and how the contingent faculty are being treated,"" Herbert said. One of the most aggressive labor groups on this front is the 2-million-member Service Employees International Union, better known for organizing the likes of janitors and fast-food workers. SEIU says it has successfully unionized adjuncts and other faculty at at least 30 schools in the last three years. Several SEIU campaigns, including the one at Loyola, include not just adjuncts but non-tenure-track professors as well.Alyson Paige Warren, an adjunct teaching English at Loyola, said she hopes union representation will give her colleagues a voice with the school administration. Like many adjuncts, Warren teaches at three different schools in order make ends meet. She is paid anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $4,500 per course each semester, without benefits. (Loyola, she said, pays on the higher end compared to other schools.) She said she never knows how many courses she'll have the following semester, or whether it will be enough to survive on. The 35-year-old still bears $60,000 in student debt.She said she was ""shocked"" when Loyola asserted that federal labor law has no jurisdiction at the school.""Loyola is holding itself to Jesuit principles, but it doesn't seem to be practicing them,"" Warren said.Steven Christensen, a Loyola spokesman, told HuffPost in an email that the school does support the right of workers to join unions. But Christensen said that as a Jesuit school, Loyola should have the right ""to define its own mission"" and to do so ""free from government entanglement."" He said Loyola disagrees with the labor board's criteria for what makes a school a religious one under the law.""While we agree that employee unionization is both valuable and just, the issue at stake here is about the freedom of 'religious institutions' from government interference with regard to their religious identity and mission,"" he said.Two Catholic university groups -- the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities and the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities -- supported Loyola in its petition seeking a religious exemption. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops did not respond to multiple requests from HuffPost for a clarification of its own stance on adjunct unions at Catholic colleges. In a 1986 pastoral letter called ""Economic Justice for All,"" the conference wrote that ""no one may deny the right to organize without attacking human dignity itself.""For decades, religious schools of all kinds have sought to exclude teachers from collective bargaining on First Amendment grounds, with mixed success. In a 2014 ruling, the NLRB clarified how a college qualifies for a religious exemption. Not only must the school ""hold itself out"" as religious in its public image, the board said, but it must also hold out the teachers in question as ""performing a religious function."" The upshot: A Catholic school that purports to have secular classrooms can't avoid labor law.Matt Williams, who teaches sociology and international studies at Loyola full-time, scoffs at the notion that he contributes to the school's Catholic atmosphere. Williams is a practicing Buddhist. ""They knew that when they hired me,"" said Williams. ""I talked about it quite openly."" Christensen said Loyola would prefer to deal directly with its faculty, rather than through a union. ""It is difficult to imagine how the [union] will be able to assist our deans, chairpersons, and faculty deliver the transformative education in the Jesuit tradition we promise our students,"" he said.Not all Catholic schools have taken the hard line against the union that Loyola and Manhattan have. When SEIU submitted a petition on behalf of contingent faculty at St. Mary's College of California in 2014, the school did not seek a religious exemption. Citing its roots as a Catholic school in the Christian Brothers tradition, St. Mary's president said the ""decision to unionize or not rests entirely with our contingent faculty and is theirs alone to make."" The teachers voted 204-64 in favor of unionizing.When Georgetown adjuncts began organizing in 2012, the school stayed out of the way. The relatively painless road to unionization stemmed from the school's ""just employment"" policy. Implemented in 2005, the policy guarantees Georgetown employees and contractors ""the right to freely associate and organize"" without opposition from the school. Fahey and Beyer say Georgetown's policy should be a model for other Catholic colleges. The case of Manhattan College is still tied up at the NLRB. On Dec. 28, the labor board ordered an election for the Loyola faculty. Ballots went out this week and will be counted at the end of the month. Christensen said Loyola will ""continue to work through the NLRB’s process."" But the school administration hasn't exhausted its legal options. It could still refuse to bargain with the union after a successful election, sending the dispute to federal court. Herbert said it is ""highly probable"" that one of the schools seeking a religious exemption will eventually mount a court challenge on the issue.Williams, the sociology lecturer, said that if the Loyola dispute was really about religious autonomy, the school would have found a way to deal with the union without government involvement. One option would have been to go through a third party to have union cards counted and certified, rather than through the NLRB. But according to SEIU, the school declined to go that route, forcing the process through the federal government. ""It's hard to make sense of it unless you see it as a delaying tactic,"" Williams said. ""Faculty unionizing is a threat to the university administration's power. It's easy [for them] to get caught up in their own little world of administering the university and lose sight of the larger social justice mission.""Correction: The original story misstated the number of adjuncts that have unionized since 2012.

The original story corresponds with a five-part radio series on WBUR, listen here.Darrell “Diamond” Jones has been in a Massachusetts prison for 30 years for a murder he says he didn’t commit. Now the 48-year-old convict, his hair turned salt-and-pepper over the decades, is hoping that a snippet of grainy video from an old TV sitcom will help set him free.In a new court filing, Jones says that police tampered with a videotaped interview of a key witness shown at his 1986 trial to remove evidence that could prove his innocence. As the video played in the courtroom, a brief segment of the “The Phil Silvers Show,” a 1950s send-up of Army life, suddenly appeared in the middle of the interview.Police attributed the bizarre non sequitur to an honest pre-trial mistake handling the tape. But forensic specialists and lawyers working for Jones say technology not available at the time of the trial shows that explanation can’t be correct and as much as 136 seconds was cut out, suggesting a deliberate “crash edit” that removed witness statements favorable to the defense.“Why would you need to cut the tape up? If you were an honest cop, why are you taking a tape, and chopping up the parts you want?” Jones asked in a recent interview. “The police set me up.”The videotape allegations are part of a motion filed in October to re-open the case in Plymouth County Superior Court, where Jones was found guilty of the 1985 murder of alleged Cuban cocaine dealer Guillermo Rodriguez in Brockton, about 25 miles south of Boston. Jones, then 19 years old, was sentenced to life without parole.Prosecutors provided no motive and offered no physical evidence linking him to the crime. None of the eyewitnesses testified in court that they were sure Jones was the shooter, although one said he looked similar to the killer and at least three had picked him out earlier in photo line-ups. An all-white jury convicted the young black father after three days of deliberations.Interviews, newly surfaced records and forensic analysis portray a case tinted by a key witness’s statement favoring the defense that didn’t make it to trial, alleged racist comments by jurors, and police who ignored other suspects and coaxed witnesses to pick Jones in photo lineups. His court-appointed attorney presented only a brief defense, and admitted later that he wasn’t sure he “was functioning with any sense at all” during the time of the trial, the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and WBUR found. The defense attorney, Kenneth Elias, died in 2013.More than 300 exonerations based on genetic evidence since 1989 have shed new light on how often the criminal justice system sends innocent people to jail in the U.S. In many of these cases, the unique traits of convicts’ DNA failed to match the forensic evidence — often blood or hair from a crime scene — that originally linked them to homicides. The Jones case is part of a growing effort to prove innocence based on non-DNA evidence, using technology unavailable at the time of conviction or new evidence casting doubt on eyewitness accounts. One-hundred-and-19 people were exonerated without DNA evidence in 2015, more than double the level of 2011, according to the latest data from a registry kept by the University of Michigan Law School. Misconduct by police or prosecutors and inadequate legal defense contributed to about half of all exonerations in the registry since 1989.In Massachusetts last year, the state Supreme Judicial Court created a 12-member commission to minimize risks that faulty eyewitness testimony — caused by problematic memory or suggestive, leading-the-witness-type police work — will send innocent people to jail. Faulty eyewitness testimony helped convict 72 percent of those proven innocent with the help of DNA since 1989, according to the New York-based Innocence Project.Richard Sproules, then a Brockton police captain who supervised detectives working the Jones case, said he questions whether justice was served after hearing about the tape and reviewing the case with a member of the convict’s legal team. Sproules pleaded guilty in 1990 to stealing drugs seized as evidence by the department, following several investigations into drug-related corruption in the Brockton police force. Sproules said in a recent interview that he was an “addict and alcoholic in full tilt,” during the five years before he was caught in 1989, which included the period when police investigated and testified against Jones.Sproules, who served 28 months in state prison, said he is speaking out because he knows first hand what it is like to be incarcerated. He said he is surprised that the District Attorney’s Office decided to prosecute in light of what he now sees as a weak case.“What evidence is there that he did it?” asked Sproules, 71. The court should “take a hard look at allowing him a hearing” to reopen the case, he says.Persuading the court to take another look will be an “uphill battle,” according to Lisa Kavanaugh, who represents Jones and is director of the Innocence Program, part of the Massachusetts public defenders’ office. Of more than 600 inmates who have applied for help since her program began in 2010, Kavanaugh and other attorneys have filed new-trial motions in 21 cases — and only seven of them have been granted.Kavanaugh said that the new evidence in the Jones case will help. The videotape shows a witness, Terie Lynn Starks, being interviewed by police prior to the trial and identifying Jones as the shooter — which she didn’t do while on the witness stand in court.The videotape “was of critical importance to the jury at trial,” said Kavanaugh. “Now that we’ve shown that the police tampered with that evidence, it changes everything.”Starks — under arrest at the time on prostitution-related charges — picked a picture of Jones out of a photo line-up while in custody. The police told her before she looked at the photos that she “could spend a long time in prison,” but that “things would go better for her if she cooperated,” according to a sworn affidavit from a lawyer who interviewed her on behalf of Jones. The Brockton Police department declined to comment for this story.The Jones conviction “has repeatedly been affirmed on appeal,” said Beth Stone, a spokeswoman for the Plymouth County District Attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case. She said the prosecutors will respond to the new motion, which follows an unsuccessful appeal and the denial of two other moves to re-open the case in 1992 and 2000.The right person was convicted, according to one of the police investigators in the case, now retired. “There is no doubt in my mind,” that Jones is guilty, said Fotis Colocousis, taking a break from mowing his lawn to answer questions. He said he and his colleagues used straightforward police work, following leads that took them to Jones.Sitting on a flimsy chair in the visitor’s room at a maximum-security prison about an hour from Boston, Jones urged people to read trial transcripts and police records, many of which his legal moves have helped bring to light. He says he doesn’t expect anyone to believe he’s innocent without considering all the evidence.After one of his sons was murdered, he was barred from attending the 2008 funeral. While in prison, he launched a program to help troubled youths and married and separated from an activist who helped him with that campaign and with his legal efforts.“I just want the truth out,” he said. “I’ve already lost so much.”The shootingRodriguez was fatally shot in the parking lot of a now-shuttered D’Angelo’s sandwich shop across the street from Pete & Mary’s bar, known by Brockton police and former patrons as a seedy hangout popular with cocaine dealers and their customers. Rodriguez — six-feet-one, 210 pounds — lay on the ground pleading for help before the ambulance whisked him away. His wallet and a gold chain were later found at the scene, suggesting robbery wasn’t the motive.Prosecutor Kevan Cunningham told the court that Jones left Pete & Mary’s to buy a steak-and-cheese sub at D’Angelo’s with a woman named Brigite Strothers. He walked back into the bar and minutes later, came out onto the street pushing Rodriguez ahead of him and then shot him dead, Cunningham said.According to the state’s case, Jones took off on foot, followed by two eyewitnesses who had been eating sandwiches in their car when they saw the attack. Prosecutors said he lost them a few blocks away after he jumped a fence, and discarded a .32 caliber automatic in a nearby bar, before returning to Pete & Mary’s. Police later were able to link the gun to the bullet that killed Rodriguez.But there were no fingerprints on the gun. Prosecutors produced no evidence that it belonged to Jones.Strothers — who still lives only blocks from the crime scene — told NECIR that police pressed her to say Jones was the killer, which she refused to do. She says she thinks he was set up, although she doesn’t know why.The police “threatened me,” Strothers said. “They kept coming to my house. They kept telling me I remembered something I didn’t remember. The streets talk in those days. I never heard people say he [Jones] did it.” At the trial, Strothers testified she drove away from the bar and the murder scene before the shooting happened.Jones agrees he bought a sub and went back to the bar to eat it. He says he was sitting with friends when police arrived at the bar and told them about the shooting. The defense presented three witnesses who testified Jones was in the bar eating a sandwich when Rodriguez was shot.One of them, Evelyn Anderson, then a 37-year-old Boston Public School reading specialist, said she is still horrified that nobody believed her. “How can you lock this boy up when he was in the bar with us?” said Anderson. “I think that boy has spent a lot of years in jail for something he didn’t do.”Not everything Anderson said at trial helped the defendant. While Jones says that to this day he doesn’t know what Rodriguez looked like, Anderson testified that she saw the two of them talking in the bar earlier that night.Jones and the victimJones has never claimed to be a saint. He racked up four juvenile arrests for breaking and entering, stealing and assault during an 18-month period before his 18th birthday. After he shoved a school security guard, he was kicked out of Boston’s English High School in the 10th grade, Jones said.As an adult, he also had a misdemeanor conviction for stealing a wallet in Brockton several weeks before Rodriguez was shot, for which he received a $50 fine.On the night Rodriguez died, he says he stepped out on his pregnant girlfriend and their 15-month-old son at home in Boston and hopped a bus to meet other girls in Brockton, where he had a group of friends and bartenders didn’t ask his age. He says his nickname, “Diamond,” came from his ability to attract girls.Despite his wandering, Jones said he had been trying to do right by his young family. He had earned his high school equivalency diploma and was working part time as a security guard.Cheryl Frederick, his Boston girlfriend, told NECIR that she knew Jones was cheating on her but put up with it because he helped out with their son and was “really in love” with her. She said her life fell apart after he was arrested and she never believed Jones was guilty. “It took my breath away,” said Frederick, now 49. “It seems like I still can’t get my breath back.”Rodriguez, a Cuban national with Miami ties, was 43 years old, married with an infant daughter. Described as a laborer on his death certificate, he was killed while facing charges of possessing and distributing cocaine.Rodriguez’s widow Claridad is 61 and now lives in Miami. Reached by phone, she said in Spanish that she believed Jones was the killer before a family member hung up the phone. Her daughter Julia, who was 11 months old when her father was killed, said talking about his case was too painful. “That story has been closed for 30 years,” she said. ‪Tunnel vision?Police records show Jones was quickly flagged as the main suspect.On the night of the murder, Colocousis writes that he showed up at D’Angelo’s responding to a reported stabbing. Instead, he found Rodriguez on a stretcher with a bullet wound. An officer handed him a slug that fell out when Rodriguez was rolled over.Police quickly zeroed in on Jones. At 4:30 p.m. the following day, Colocousis wrote in a police report, he visited an informant named Robert Allen who told him the shooter was someone known as Diamond. The detective’s report described Jones as a tall 18-year-old who “carries a .38” gun and was “supposedly wanted” under outstanding arrest warrants in Boston.Colocousis wrote that another officer heard from an unnamed source that Diamond was Darrell Jones — described as “dangerous and very clever,” supplying a group called the “Commandos” with weapons.Jones said in interviews that he’s amazed by what he’s read in these police reports, which he first saw a few years ago. He says that he was not a gun supplier, had no outstanding arrest warrants and wouldn’t have needed to lift a wallet or ride buses if he were a sophisticated criminal. Jones said he never heard of the Commandos, which may have been a small local gang. His criminal record — available in the prosecutorial file — shows no history of weapons possession or outstanding criminal warrants at the time of the killing.The Innocence Program says Allen has told its legal team that he only shared rumors he’d heard on the street and that the only thing accurate about the report was that he told police they should be looking for “a guy named ‘Diamond.’”The informant interviews apparently helped turn the spotlight on Jones. On the same day police spoke to Allen, a memo from Detective Donald LaGarde described Jones as the “prime suspect” and LaGarde, now deceased, showed a witness who had been near the crime scene a photo line-up including Jones. Other leads appear to have been ignored. Detective Joe Smith, who was assigned to the homicide investigation three days after the shooting, wrote in a police report that a Brockton bus driver named Steven Betts “has been mentioned several times as possibly being the one that did the shooting.” He interviewed a former girlfriend of Betts, who said he “might have been involved in the shooting,” records show.Betts — who had many run-ins with the law — died in 2003 of liver failure and alcohol abuse, according to his death certificate and criminal history report. Available police records don’t show that anyone interviewed Betts about the Rodriguez killing.His brother Keith Betts, found in October at his Brockton home with a tidy lawn covered with Halloween decorations, said he had never heard before that his brother was a suspect or was questioned about the shooting. “I would have known,” he said.James Trainum, a former Washington, DC-based homicide investigator, says the Jones case shows signs of “tunnel vision,” in which police decide a person is guilty and then filter out inputs that don’t support their conclusion. “The odds are… they honestly believed at one point he was the right suspect,” said Trainum, who now specializes in reviewing alleged wrongful convictions. “It was just sloppy investigation.”Former detective Smith, reached by phone, declined to discuss the case. “What’s on paper is what happened,” he said.Six days after the shooting, Jones said he heard that police were asking about him, so he called them and told them he was coming in to talk. Police records don’t show any calls from him that night. He said he stopped for a meeting with his father at Pete & Mary’s, where police picked him up. Jones said he still wasn’t too worried and believed he would soon be let go. “I thought it was humorous,” he said. “I was just looking at it like a joke.”But things turned serious quickly. Weeks later, Jones was charged with murder and said he was unable to pay bail, initially set at $49,000, and spent ten months in jail waiting to face a jury.Problematic defenseOn the first day of trial, defense attorney Kenneth Elias — a tall man with a booming voice and unkempt hair — told the jury not to draw any conclusions from the unconventional seating he’d arranged for Jones. Instead of sitting next to Elias, as is customary, the defendant had a chair in the prisoner’s dock behind him — about 10 feet behind, according to Jones.“I like to be alone. I don’t want to be distracted,” Elias told the court. “A defendant sometimes gets excited by what’s going on by testimony.”Separation prevents a defendant from instructing his attorney immediately as evidence is presented and could prejudice the jury against him by setting him apart, according to legal experts interviewed for this story. “Any rational person practicing law today would recognize that that is problematic,” said William Fitzpatrick, president of the Virginia-based National District Attorneys Association. “A lawyer has to be able to communicate with his or her client.”Jones was surprised two days into the trial, when Elias notified him that he had represented three police officers testifying for the prosecution — including Colocousis, Smith and LaGarde. The judge asked Jones whether he wanted another attorney, and he declined. Today he says he regrets that decision, didn’t understand his rights and was worried a new lawyer would have been costly to his family.The ties between Elias and the police could have inhibited the defense, according to Kevin Reddington, an attorney who represented a Brockton officer during one of the investigations into missing cocaine. “The problem is, even if it is a past client, you still know potential secrets. You might know things about them,” Reddington said. “Instead of having undivided loyalty you have a conflict of interest.”Before his 2013 death, Elias said that his legal practice was in disarray while he defended Jones because he had too many clients. While he represented Jones, he was also facing allegations before the state bar association that he had moved a client’s money into his own account, which ultimately led to a seven-year suspension from practicing law.His work diary showed that most days he had as many as three court appearances and six or seven meetings. “I had no idea what was going on,” he admitted in 1993 to the Board of Bar Overseers. In most cases, he told the board he “was just showing up” for court appearances. “I couldn’t do a very good job of it, and I didn’t.”Elias billed 14 hours of investigative work in the Jones case. Six trial witnesses — including Anderson, who testified for the defense — told NECIR or the Innocence Program that Elias didn’t interview them before the trial. Jones said Elias met with him for two-and-a-half hours in the ten months he was in jail awaiting trial.Spending so little time investigating and failing to preview witnesses represent major weaknesses, according to Mike Hussey, president of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.“Any time you have that kind of situation, one has to seriously consider whether a tragic miscarriage of justice has occurred,” he said. Elias appears to have missed another opportunity presented by the case records — the inconsistencies between eyewitness testimony and the size of the man they convicted. At least four witnesses, either in depositions, court or grand jury testimony, described a shooter who was noticeably shorter — as much as a foot shorter — than Rodriguez. Jones, at six feet, is only an inch shorter than the height listed for the victim in his autopsy. “He should have told me to stand up,” says Jones.Elias “was completely and utterly out to lunch during this case,” Kavanaugh says.Doctored tape?Terie Lynn Starks was sitting in a Cadillac Eldorado outside D’Angelo’s with a group of friends on the night of the shooting. Brockton police arrested her about two weeks later on outstanding warrants and quickly expressed interest in what she had seen in the parking lot.In a videotaped police interview shown at the trial, Starks sat between officers Smith and LaGarde. She told police she was in the passenger seat after drinking a couple of rum and cokes. The music was on and the windows were rolled up when she saw a “smaller guy” pushing a “taller guy” across the street, she said. “When they got to the sidewalk, I saw a gun.”The interview was interrupted when the color video suddenly cut to a black-and-white scene of a singing soldier from an episode of the old Silvers TV show and then returned to Starks and the police. At the trial, Smith testified that the cut-away happened when he accidentally hit “record” instead of “play” on the VCR while running the tape for Elias before the trial.Elias objected to the introduction of the tape for reasons other than the interruption — and was overruled. He didn’t attach much significance to the break. “You mean you recorded something else over that tape while I was there?” he asked Smith in the courtroom before moving on. “It’s probably immaterial; I don’t even remember it.”Jones and his attorneys say new, digital analysis of the tape by experts they hired points to the conclusion that the tape was altered on purpose to remove statements by Starks favorable to the defense. The new evidence “strongly suggests that the police deliberately performed a crash edit” of the interview by recording from the master tape to a copy tape while removing content, according to the motion to reopen the case.Smith’s explanation for the interruption is “not possible” because police must have re-recorded the interview onto a tape that already had the TV show on it, according to an affidavit supporting Jones’ motion from Jeff Spivack, owner of a Florida multimedia firm that specializes in examining recordings. The videotape shown in court wasn’t even the first copy, but at least “third generation” – or a copy of a copy, Spivack said. The missing testimony could have been as brief as the 20 or so seconds that police estimated, but it also could have been as much as two minutes and 16 seconds, according to the second recording expert. Jones’ motion argues, “the forensic analysis is consistent with a scenario in which someone erased a segment of the tape and then tried to conceal or minimize his conduct.”Jones believes what was carved out of the tape at the very least conflicts with the prosecutor’s account of events. According to a memo from LaGarde released by Brockton police in 2011, Starks told police during the videotaped interview that the shooter and the victim had not approached the scene of the murder from the front door of Pete & Mary’s — as described by Cunningham, the trial prosecutor.The memo says she saw them approaching the parking lot from another street about a block away. No account of a statement like that appears on the videotape. According to Jones’ plea, seeing the complete video could have changed the jury’s mind about the prosecutor’s efforts to identify Jones, which relied heavily on his movements that night.In the video, Starks picks a picture out of a photo array, and Detective Smith then says she has selected Jones. In court, Starks said she couldn’t “be positive” that he was the one who killed Rodriguez.Other testimony also cast doubt on Jones’ guilt.Paul Jones, who is no relation to Darrell, told police that he was with his girlfriend Denise Perkins at D’Angelo’s the night of the shooting. He said he was buying sandwiches when two African Americans — a young man and woman — arrived to buy food. The man, he said, returned to Pete & Mary’s, and four or five minutes later came back out pushing a taller Cuban man, and shot him in the parking lot.Jones, now 54 and living in nearby Avon, says he is still confident that the man who purchased the sandwich killed Rodriguez, in a shooting that still unnerves him. At trial, Paul Jones told the jury that he wasn’t certain that the man he saw in the courtroom — Darrell Jones — was the shooter.“I did not point him out because I wasn’t 100 percent sure it was him,” Jones told NECIR during a recent walkthrough of the crime scene.On the witness stand, Perkins also said she wasn’t sure, but pointed to Jones when she was asked if anyone in the courtroom was “of a similar description” to the shooter.Perkins later said that police prodded her to identify Jones in photo line-ups. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s commission examining police-identification practices, has recommended that police who show photos to witnesses should not know who is the suspect is, and should not confirm a witness’s choice – which could lead to them being more confident about identifications in court.“When I narrowed it down to four the police told me that I was doing well because the guy was in that group of photographs,” Perkins said in a 2014 affidavit. “It seemed like the police already knew who did it and they were just asking me to confirm what they already knew.”Lisa Pina, another eyewitness, who was in the same car as Starks, testified in court that she couldn’t identify Jones as the shooter.“I did not see much that night, but I felt like the police had their own idea of what happened and they wanted me to come to the same conclusion that they did,” Pina said in a 2014 affidavit filed with the motion for retrial. Jones said he had planned to testify in his defense but didn’t after Elias advised him not to — since he had failed a lie detector test in a pre-trial interview in which he said “no” when asked if he shot Rodriguez. If Jones had taken the stand, the test results could have been used against him in court to cast doubt on his denial. Several years later, in 1989, the state Supreme Judicial Court banned such use of the tests in criminal trials, saying the accuracy rates for innocent subjects was only “slightly better” than “flipping a coin.”On the first day of its deliberations, the jury asked the judge for a definition of “beyond a reasonable doubt.” The next day, it said it couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict, as required by law. After the judge told them to keep trying, they returned a guilty verdict on the third day.The jurorsEleanor Urbati said she was the last juror holding out for not guilty. Initially unconvinced by the evidence, the retired telephone operator said in a recent interview that the judge’s instructions when things were deadlocked — to find a way to agree — persuaded her to give in.“It just seemed like everybody was against this kid for whatever reason,” said Urbati, who is 79. “All I had to do was say ‘no’…I’ve been regretting it my whole life.”Another thing that troubles Urbati: two jurors’ comments that she deemed “racist.” On the first day of deliberations, she said both of them believed Jones was guilty.“Because he’s black?” she asked. “And they said, ‘yes.’ They said ‘yes,’ the two men. How do you like that?”Urbati said she couldn’t remember the two jurors’ names. Anthony Padula, another juror in the case, said he had no memory of anyone saying they believed Jones to be the killer because he is black.“The evidence as far as I am concerned is that 30 years ago he was guilty as sin,” said Padula, who now lives in Maine. He said that he was convinced partly because eyewitnesses identified Jones as the shooter and picked him in line-ups. Charles Costas, the jury’s foreman, said he didn’t remember jurors saying “anything like” the racially biased words Urbati recalled. “I’m done with it,” Costas said, declining further comment. “I can’t help you.”For Jones, it’s not done. His new motion to reopen the case could take months to decide. He says he’s still waiting for the government to produce evidence showing he was the killer.“My story’s the same story every day,” he says. “I’m still in jail.” This story was written by Jenifer McKim and reported by McKim, WBUR reporter Bruce Gellerman, researcher Leonard Singer, NECIR interns Evelyn Martinez and Bianca Padro, and students from a NECIR investigative class held at Boston University.

The original story corresponds with a five-part radio series on WBUR, listen here.Darrell “Diamond” Jones has been in a Massachusetts prison for 30 years for a murder he says he didn’t commit. Now the 48-year-old convict, his hair turned salt-and-pepper over the decades, is hoping that a snippet of grainy video from an old TV sitcom will help set him free.In a new court filing, Jones says that police tampered with a videotaped interview of a key witness shown at his 1986 trial to remove evidence that could prove his innocence. As the video played in the courtroom, a brief segment of the “The Phil Silvers Show,” a 1950s send-up of Army life, suddenly appeared in the middle of the interview.Police attributed the bizarre non sequitur to an honest pre-trial mistake handling the tape. But forensic specialists and lawyers working for Jones say technology not available at the time of the trial shows that explanation can’t be correct and as much as 136 seconds was cut out, suggesting a deliberate “crash edit” that removed witness statements favorable to the defense.“Why would you need to cut the tape up? If you were an honest cop, why are you taking a tape, and chopping up the parts you want?” Jones asked in a recent interview. “The police set me up.”The videotape allegations are part of a motion filed in October to re-open the case in Plymouth County Superior Court, where Jones was found guilty of the 1985 murder of alleged Cuban cocaine dealer Guillermo Rodriguez in Brockton, about 25 miles south of Boston. Jones, then 19 years old, was sentenced to life without parole.Prosecutors provided no motive and offered no physical evidence linking him to the crime. None of the eyewitnesses testified in court that they were sure Jones was the shooter, although one said he looked similar to the killer and at least three had picked him out earlier in photo line-ups. An all-white jury convicted the young black father after three days of deliberations.Interviews, newly surfaced records and forensic analysis portray a case tinted by a key witness’s statement favoring the defense that didn’t make it to trial, alleged racist comments by jurors, and police who ignored other suspects and coaxed witnesses to pick Jones in photo lineups. His court-appointed attorney presented only a brief defense, and admitted later that he wasn’t sure he “was functioning with any sense at all” during the time of the trial, the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and WBUR found. The defense attorney, Kenneth Elias, died in 2013.More than 300 exonerations based on genetic evidence since 1989 have shed new light on how often the criminal justice system sends innocent people to jail in the U.S. In many of these cases, the unique traits of convicts’ DNA failed to match the forensic evidence — often blood or hair from a crime scene — that originally linked them to homicides. The Jones case is part of a growing effort to prove innocence based on non-DNA evidence, using technology unavailable at the time of conviction or new evidence casting doubt on eyewitness accounts. One-hundred-and-19 people were exonerated without DNA evidence in 2015, more than double the level of 2011, according to the latest data from a registry kept by the University of Michigan Law School. Misconduct by police or prosecutors and inadequate legal defense contributed to about half of all exonerations in the registry since 1989.In Massachusetts last year, the state Supreme Judicial Court created a 12-member commission to minimize risks that faulty eyewitness testimony — caused by problematic memory or suggestive, leading-the-witness-type police work — will send innocent people to jail. Faulty eyewitness testimony helped convict 72 percent of those proven innocent with the help of DNA since 1989, according to the New York-based Innocence Project.Richard Sproules, then a Brockton police captain who supervised detectives working the Jones case, said he questions whether justice was served after hearing about the tape and reviewing the case with a member of the convict’s legal team. Sproules pleaded guilty in 1990 to stealing drugs seized as evidence by the department, following several investigations into drug-related corruption in the Brockton police force. Sproules said in a recent interview that he was an “addict and alcoholic in full tilt,” during the five years before he was caught in 1989, which included the period when police investigated and testified against Jones.Sproules, who served 28 months in state prison, said he is speaking out because he knows first hand what it is like to be incarcerated. He said he is surprised that the District Attorney’s Office decided to prosecute in light of what he now sees as a weak case.“What evidence is there that he did it?” asked Sproules, 71. The court should “take a hard look at allowing him a hearing” to reopen the case, he says.Persuading the court to take another look will be an “uphill battle,” according to Lisa Kavanaugh, who represents Jones and is director of the Innocence Program, part of the Massachusetts public defenders’ office. Of more than 600 inmates who have applied for help since her program began in 2010, Kavanaugh and other attorneys have filed new-trial motions in 21 cases — and only seven of them have been granted.Kavanaugh said that the new evidence in the Jones case will help. The videotape shows a witness, Terie Lynn Starks, being interviewed by police prior to the trial and identifying Jones as the shooter — which she didn’t do while on the witness stand in court.The videotape “was of critical importance to the jury at trial,” said Kavanaugh. “Now that we’ve shown that the police tampered with that evidence, it changes everything.”Starks — under arrest at the time on prostitution-related charges — picked a picture of Jones out of a photo line-up while in custody. The police told her before she looked at the photos that she “could spend a long time in prison,” but that “things would go better for her if she cooperated,” according to a sworn affidavit from a lawyer who interviewed her on behalf of Jones. The Brockton Police department declined to comment for this story.The Jones conviction “has repeatedly been affirmed on appeal,” said Beth Stone, a spokeswoman for the Plymouth County District Attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case. She said the prosecutors will respond to the new motion, which follows an unsuccessful appeal and the denial of two other moves to re-open the case in 1992 and 2000.The right person was convicted, according to one of the police investigators in the case, now retired. “There is no doubt in my mind,” that Jones is guilty, said Fotis Colocousis, taking a break from mowing his lawn to answer questions. He said he and his colleagues used straightforward police work, following leads that took them to Jones.Sitting on a flimsy chair in the visitor’s room at a maximum-security prison about an hour from Boston, Jones urged people to read trial transcripts and police records, many of which his legal moves have helped bring to light. He says he doesn’t expect anyone to believe he’s innocent without considering all the evidence.After one of his sons was murdered, he was barred from attending the 2008 funeral. While in prison, he launched a program to help troubled youths and married and separated from an activist who helped him with that campaign and with his legal efforts.“I just want the truth out,” he said. “I’ve already lost so much.”The shootingRodriguez was fatally shot in the parking lot of a now-shuttered D’Angelo’s sandwich shop across the street from Pete & Mary’s bar, known by Brockton police and former patrons as a seedy hangout popular with cocaine dealers and their customers. Rodriguez — six-feet-one, 210 pounds — lay on the ground pleading for help before the ambulance whisked him away. His wallet and a gold chain were later found at the scene, suggesting robbery wasn’t the motive.Prosecutor Kevan Cunningham told the court that Jones left Pete & Mary’s to buy a steak-and-cheese sub at D’Angelo’s with a woman named Brigite Strothers. He walked back into the bar and minutes later, came out onto the street pushing Rodriguez ahead of him and then shot him dead, Cunningham said.According to the state’s case, Jones took off on foot, followed by two eyewitnesses who had been eating sandwiches in their car when they saw the attack. Prosecutors said he lost them a few blocks away after he jumped a fence, and discarded a .32 caliber automatic in a nearby bar, before returning to Pete & Mary’s. Police later were able to link the gun to the bullet that killed Rodriguez.But there were no fingerprints on the gun. Prosecutors produced no evidence that it belonged to Jones.Strothers — who still lives only blocks from the crime scene — told NECIR that police pressed her to say Jones was the killer, which she refused to do. She says she thinks he was set up, although she doesn’t know why.The police “threatened me,” Strothers said. “They kept coming to my house. They kept telling me I remembered something I didn’t remember. The streets talk in those days. I never heard people say he [Jones] did it.” At the trial, Strothers testified she drove away from the bar and the murder scene before the shooting happened.Jones agrees he bought a sub and went back to the bar to eat it. He says he was sitting with friends when police arrived at the bar and told them about the shooting. The defense presented three witnesses who testified Jones was in the bar eating a sandwich when Rodriguez was shot.One of them, Evelyn Anderson, then a 37-year-old Boston Public School reading specialist, said she is still horrified that nobody believed her. “How can you lock this boy up when he was in the bar with us?” said Anderson. “I think that boy has spent a lot of years in jail for something he didn’t do.”Not everything Anderson said at trial helped the defendant.

He had earned his high school equivalency diploma and was working part time as a security guard.Cheryl Frederick, his Boston girlfriend, told NECIR that she knew Jones was cheating on her but put up with it because he helped out with their son and was “really in love” with her. She said her life fell apart after he was arrested and she never believed Jones was guilty. “It took my breath away,” said Frederick, now 49. “It seems like I still can’t get my breath back.”Rodriguez, a Cuban national with Miami ties, was 43 years old, married with an infant daughter.

His criminal record — available in the prosecutorial file — shows no history of weapons possession or outstanding criminal warrants at the time of the killing.The Innocence Program says Allen has told its legal team that he only shared rumors he’d heard on the street and that the only thing accurate about the report was that he told police they should be looking for “a guy named ‘Diamond.’”The informant interviews apparently helped turn the spotlight on Jones. On the same day police spoke to Allen, a memo from Detective Donald LaGarde described Jones as the “prime suspect” and LaGarde, now deceased, showed a witness who had been near the crime scene a photo line-up including Jones. Other leads appear to have been ignored. Detective Joe Smith, who was assigned to the homicide investigation three days after the shooting, wrote in a police report that a Brockton bus driver named Steven Betts “has been mentioned several times as possibly being the one that did the shooting.” He interviewed a former girlfriend of Betts, who said he “might have been involved in the shooting,” records show.Betts — who had many run-ins with the law — died in 2003 of liver failure and alcohol abuse, according to his death certificate and criminal history report. Available police records don’t show that anyone interviewed Betts about the Rodriguez killing.His brother Keith Betts, found in October at his Brockton home with a tidy lawn covered with Halloween decorations, said he had never heard before that his brother was a suspect or was questioned about the shooting. “I would have known,” he said.James Trainum, a former Washington, DC-based homicide investigator, says the Jones case shows signs of “tunnel vision,” in which police decide a person is guilty and then filter out inputs that don’t support their conclusion. “The odds are… they honestly believed at one point he was the right suspect,” said Trainum, who now specializes in reviewing alleged wrongful convictions. “It was just sloppy investigation.”Former detective Smith, reached by phone, declined to discuss the case. “What’s on paper is what happened,” he said.Six days after the shooting, Jones said he heard that police were asking about him, so he called them and told them he was coming in to talk. Police records don’t show any calls from him that night. He said he stopped for a meeting with his father at Pete & Mary’s, where police picked him up. Jones said he still wasn’t too worried and believed he would soon be let go. “I thought it was humorous,” he said. “I was just looking at it like a joke.”But things turned serious quickly. Weeks later, Jones was charged with murder and said he was unable to pay bail, initially set at $49,000, and spent ten months in jail waiting to face a jury.Problematic defenseOn the first day of trial, defense attorney Kenneth Elias — a tall man with a booming voice and unkempt hair — told the jury not to draw any conclusions from the unconventional seating he’d arranged for Jones. Instead of sitting next to Elias, as is customary, the defendant had a chair in the prisoner’s dock behind him — about 10 feet behind, according to Jones.“I like to be alone. I don’t want to be distracted,” Elias told the court. “A defendant sometimes gets excited by what’s going on by testimony.”Separation prevents a defendant from instructing his attorney immediately as evidence is presented and could prejudice the jury against him by setting him apart, according to legal experts interviewed for this story. “Any rational person practicing law today would recognize that that is problematic,” said William Fitzpatrick, president of the Virginia-based National District Attorneys Association. “A lawyer has to be able to communicate with his or her client.”Jones was surprised two days into the trial, when Elias notified him that he had represented three police officers testifying for the prosecution — including Colocousis, Smith and LaGarde. The judge asked Jones whether he wanted another attorney, and he declined. Today he says he regrets that decision, didn’t understand his rights and was worried a new lawyer would have been costly to his family.The ties between Elias and the police could have inhibited the defense, according to Kevin Reddington, an attorney who represented a Brockton officer during one of the investigations into missing cocaine. “The problem is, even if it is a past client, you still know potential secrets. You might know things about them,” Reddington said. “Instead of having undivided loyalty you have a conflict of interest.”Before his 2013 death, Elias said that his legal practice was in disarray while he defended Jones because he had too many clients. While he represented Jones, he was also facing allegations before the state bar association that he had moved a client’s money into his own account, which ultimately led to a seven-year suspension from practicing law.His work diary showed that most days he had as many as three court appearances and six or seven meetings. “I had no idea what was going on,” he admitted in 1993 to the Board of Bar Overseers. In most cases, he told the board he “was just showing up” for court appearances. “I couldn’t do a very good job of it, and I didn’t.”Elias billed 14 hours of investigative work in the Jones case. Six trial witnesses — including Anderson, who testified for the defense — told NECIR or the Innocence Program that Elias didn’t interview them before the trial. Jones said Elias met with him for two-and-a-half hours in the ten months he was in jail awaiting trial.Spending so little time investigating and failing to preview witnesses represent major weaknesses, according to Mike Hussey, president of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.“Any time you have that kind of situation, one has to seriously consider whether a tragic miscarriage of justice has occurred,” he said. Elias appears to have missed another opportunity presented by the case records — the inconsistencies between eyewitness testimony and the size of the man they convicted. At least four witnesses, either in depositions, court or grand jury testimony, described a shooter who was noticeably shorter — as much as a foot shorter — than Rodriguez. Jones, at six feet, is only an inch shorter than the height listed for the victim in his autopsy. “He should have told me to stand up,” says Jones.Elias “was completely and utterly out to lunch during this case,” Kavanaugh says.Doctored tape?Terie Lynn Starks was sitting in a Cadillac Eldorado outside D’Angelo’s with a group of friends on the night of the shooting. Brockton police arrested her about two weeks later on outstanding warrants and quickly expressed interest in what she had seen in the parking lot.In a videotaped police interview shown at the trial, Starks sat between officers Smith and LaGarde. She told police she was in the passenger seat after drinking a couple of rum and cokes. The music was on and the windows were rolled up when she saw a “smaller guy” pushing a “taller guy” across the street, she said. “When they got to the sidewalk, I saw a gun.”The interview was interrupted when the color video suddenly cut to a black-and-white scene of a singing soldier from an episode of the old Silvers TV show and then returned to Starks and the police. At the trial, Smith testified that the cut-away happened when he accidentally hit “record” instead of “play” on the VCR while running the tape for Elias before the trial.Elias objected to the introduction of the tape for reasons other than the interruption — and was overruled. He didn’t attach much significance to the break. “You mean you recorded something else over that tape while I was there?” he asked Smith in the courtroom before moving on. “It’s probably immaterial; I don’t even remember it.”Jones and his attorneys say new, digital analysis of the tape by experts they hired points to the conclusion that the tape was altered on purpose to remove statements by Starks favorable to the defense. The new evidence “strongly suggests that the police deliberately performed a crash edit” of the interview by recording from the master tape to a copy tape while removing content, according to the motion to reopen the case.Smith’s explanation for the interruption is “not possible” because police must have re-recorded the interview onto a tape that already had the TV show on it, according to an affidavit supporting Jones’ motion from Jeff Spivack, owner of a Florida multimedia firm that specializes in examining recordings. The videotape shown in court wasn’t even the first copy, but at least “third generation” – or a copy of a copy, Spivack said. The missing testimony could have been as brief as the 20 or so seconds that police estimated, but it also could have been as much as two minutes and 16 seconds, according to the second recording expert. Jones’ motion argues, “the forensic analysis is consistent with a scenario in which someone erased a segment of the tape and then tried to conceal or minimize his conduct.”Jones believes what was carved out of the tape at the very least conflicts with the prosecutor’s account of events. According to a memo from LaGarde released by Brockton police in 2011, Starks told police during the videotaped interview that the shooter and the victim had not approached the scene of the murder from the front door of Pete & Mary’s — as described by Cunningham, the trial prosecutor.The memo says she saw them approaching the parking lot from another street about a block away. No account of a statement like that appears on the videotape. According to Jones’ plea, seeing the complete video could have changed the jury’s mind about the prosecutor’s efforts to identify Jones, which relied heavily on his movements that night.In the video, Starks picks a picture out of a photo array, and Detective Smith then says she has selected Jones. In court, Starks said she couldn’t “be positive” that he was the one who killed Rodriguez.Other testimony also cast doubt on Jones’ guilt.Paul Jones, who is no relation to Darrell, told police that he was with his girlfriend Denise Perkins at D’Angelo’s the night of the shooting. He said he was buying sandwiches when two African Americans — a young man and woman — arrived to buy food. The man, he said, returned to Pete & Mary’s, and four or five minutes later came back out pushing a taller Cuban man, and shot him in the parking lot.Jones, now 54 and living in nearby Avon, says he is still confident that the man who purchased the sandwich killed Rodriguez, in a shooting that still unnerves him. At trial, Paul Jones told the jury that he wasn’t certain that the man he saw in the courtroom — Darrell Jones — was the shooter.“I did not point him out because I wasn’t 100 percent sure it was him,” Jones told NECIR during a recent walkthrough of the crime scene.On the witness stand, Perkins also said she wasn’t sure, but pointed to Jones when she was asked if anyone in the courtroom was “of a similar description” to the shooter.Perkins later said that police prodded her to identify Jones in photo line-ups. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s commission examining police-identification practices, has recommended that police who show photos to witnesses should not know who is the suspect is, and should not confirm a witness’s choice – which could lead to them being more confident about identifications in court.“When I narrowed it down to four the police told me that I was doing well because the guy was in that group of photographs,” Perkins said in a 2014 affidavit. “It seemed like the police already knew who did it and they were just asking me to confirm what they already knew.”Lisa Pina, another eyewitness, who was in the same car as Starks, testified in court that she couldn’t identify Jones as the shooter.“I did not see much that night, but I felt like the police had their own idea of what happened and they wanted me to come to the same conclusion that they did,” Pina said in a 2014 affidavit filed with the motion for retrial. Jones said he had planned to testify in his defense but didn’t after Elias advised him not to — since he had failed a lie detector test in a pre-trial interview in which he said “no” when asked if he shot Rodriguez. If Jones had taken the stand, the test results could have been used against him in court to cast doubt on his denial. Several years later, in 1989, the state Supreme Judicial Court banned such use of the tests in criminal trials, saying the accuracy rates for innocent subjects was only “slightly better” than “flipping a coin.”On the first day of its deliberations, the jury asked the judge for a definition of “beyond a reasonable doubt.” The next day, it said it couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict, as required by law. After the judge told them to keep trying, they returned a guilty verdict on the third day.The jurorsEleanor Urbati said she was the last juror holding out for not guilty. Initially unconvinced by the evidence, the retired telephone operator said in a recent interview that the judge’s instructions when things were deadlocked — to find a way to agree — persuaded her to give in.“It just seemed like everybody was against this kid for whatever reason,” said Urbati, who is 79. “All I had to do was say ‘no’…I’ve been regretting it my whole life.”Another thing that troubles Urbati: two jurors’ comments that she deemed “racist.” On the first day of deliberations, she said both of them believed Jones was guilty.“Because he’s black?” she asked. “And they said, ‘yes.’ They said ‘yes,’ the two men. How do you like that?”Urbati said she couldn’t remember the two jurors’ names. Anthony Padula, another juror in the case, said he had no memory of anyone saying they believed Jones to be the killer because he is black.“The evidence as far as I am concerned is that 30 years ago he was guilty as sin,” said Padula, who now lives in Maine. He said that he was convinced partly because eyewitnesses identified Jones as the shooter and picked him in line-ups. Charles Costas, the jury’s foreman, said he didn’t remember jurors saying “anything like” the racially biased words Urbati recalled. “I’m done with it,” Costas said, declining further comment. “I can’t help you.”For Jones, it’s not done. His new motion to reopen the case could take months to decide. He says he’s still waiting for the government to produce evidence showing he was the killer.“My story’s the same story every day,” he says. “I’m still in jail.” This story was written by Jenifer McKim and reported by McKim, WBUR reporter Bruce Gellerman, researcher Leonard Singer, NECIR interns Evelyn Martinez and Bianca Padro, and students from a NECIR investigative class held at Boston University.

Water dripping off icebergs and into the Antarctic Ocean, also known as the Southern Ocean, contains iron and other nutrients, according to research published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience. These nutrients fertilize phytoplankton, the microscopic marine life that plays a key role in oceanic ecosystems, and help the tiny plants absorb carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as they grow into plumes. In other words, there might be even more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere if it weren't for the help of phytoplankton, said Dr. Grant Bigg, professor of earth system science at the University of Sheffield in England and lead author of the study.""Previous research had shown that there was a fertilizing effect from iceberg meltwater but no one had looked at the giant icebergs in a systematic way before,"" he said. ""The extent, and strength, of the fertilized phytoplankton plume was the big surprise.""For the study, Bigg and his colleagues analyzed 175 satellite images taken between 2003 and 2013 that show ocean water and at least 18-kilometer-long icebergs in the remote Antarctic Ocean. A greenish color of the water indicated high levels of phytoplankton productivity.They noticed the colorful phytoplankton plumes in the photos extended hundreds of kilometers from giant icebergs and persisted for at least a month after the iceberg passed by.

27,POLITICS,The 2015 State Of The Union Drinking Game,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-state-of-the-union-drinking-game_us_5694246be4b05b3245da13e6,"As President Barack Obama prepares to deliver his last State of the Union address, you should prepare to get soused.",2016-01-12,What surprises will Obama have at this year's State of the Union address? ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569424c51a00002d00ab04f4.jpeg?cache=E33bFLwZVW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Well, everyone, it's January of 2016 and it's time for the State of the Union address. This year it's President Barack Obama's last such speech before a joint session of Congress, a fact that will greatly please the president's critics, though probably not as much as it will please the POTUS himself.But for one last time, the pundits that chronicled the Obama era will polish up their State of the Union hot takes, all of which were prewritten over the past weekend.We know how this goes. The president will make an entrance, stroll down the aisle shaking hands, ascend to the dais, and with a friendly acknowledgment of the vice president and the speaker of the House, launch into a lengthy oration that -- if history is our guide -- will contain one really bad joke, the kind your dad makes where everyone groans amiably. There will be ovations and snubs, sleepy elderly lawmakers and feisty young firebrands, call-outs and camera cut-aways. And for one member of the Cabinet, there's a potentially exciting new opportunity if the contrivance that I like to refer to as ""The Cylons Nuke Caprica Scenario"" unfolds.In times past, I've noted that the State of the Union address, as an oration, is ritually oversold as something that really matters deeply to the course of our politics. Political science teaches us that presidential speeches tend to not move or shape public opinion, that when presidents make big speeches they focus on policies that are broadly popular in the first place, and that anything else should be seen as a signal to the opposition party about the policies over which the president would like to negotiate.But this time, you can throw that out the window because it's Obama's last year, and the big battles in Congress have all been put to bed. So this year, the president has said that this address might break with the traditions of the past.That could mean many things. Maybe he'll invite the cast of ""Hamilton"" to sing. Maybe he will, as has been reported, simply ""focus on issues 'beyond the next election' and skip the traditional list of the year's legislative goals."" Maybe Donald Trump will join him to reveal that the two of them have been engaged in an eight-year-long situationist prank about democracy in the age of late-stage capitalism.Whatever it is, our drinking game will have you prepared for every conceivable possibility.***What Is The State Of The Union?Take a sipObama says, “The state of the union is strong.”Take a swigObama says, “The state of the union is continuing to improve.”Pound a shotObama says, “The state of the union ... it's aiight, right?

If you use the actual population -- 322.8 million -- we'd get just $4.02 each, plus a fraction of a cent. Since $1.3 billion is the jackpot for those who choose to have it paid out over 30 years, that adds up to a hair over 13 cents per person per year.Since the meme was created, the jackpot jumped to $1.4 billion -- or enough to give everyone roughly an extra penny per year.Don't spend it all in one place. Instagram user Esteyban has deleted the original post and owned up to the math mistake. ""Sometimes it takes a little humility and humor to start a conversation about an important topic,"" he wrote. The next Powerball drawing is on Wednesday night. Also on HuffPost: "
32,QUEER VOICES,Here's How Taraji P. Henson Would Silence Homophobic 'Empire' Haters,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taraji-p-henson-homophobia_us_569525b5e4b05b3245da7445,The Golden Globe winner is not amused.,2016-01-12,"NBC's ""72nd Annual Golden Globe Awards"" - Arrivals",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5692e95e17000042005671e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Taraji P. Henson doesn't have time for homophobia. The 45-year-old actress, who nabbed a Golden Globe on Sunday for her role as Cookie Lyon on ""Empire,"" told People that she and her cast mates aren't fazed by the anti-gay reactions from critics of the smash Fox series. ""We ignore that. That's nonsense and that's fear, so we understand where that's coming from, so there's nothing to comment on that,"" she said. ""People are dealing with this, it's not a joke, that's why it's in the script. It's not for show, it's not for sensationalism.""Objection to the gay content of ""Empire"" has been significant. A scene from the show's first season in which gay R&B singer Jamal (Jussie Smollett) shared a kiss with his boyfriend, Michael (Rafael de La Fuente), reportedly tanked among test audiences, but co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong opted to leave it in anyway. Meanwhile, 50 Cent took heat in October when he appeared to link a recent dip in ratings for ""Empire"" to the ""gay stuff"" on the show in a since-deleted post on his Instagram account. A press rep later clarified that the rapper had simply ""reposted something on Instagram that originated from a blog"" and deleted the post once he realized it was ""not a reflection of his views at all."" According to Henson, that type of perceived backlash is exactly why she and the show's cast and creatives are choosing to ""shed light"" on gay issues. ""You can't make everybody happy, we don't try to,"" she told People. ""We just try to touch and affect lives and I think we have.""And how would Henson directly address her critics?""I'll send you cookies, thanks,"" she quipped. Also on HuffPost: "

35,POLITICS,The Numbers Of Mothers And Kids Picked Up At The Border Are Rising Again,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/border-crisis-families-unaccompanied-children_us_56954300e4b09dbb4bacc33a,Many of them are fleeing the ongoing violence in Central America.,2016-01-12,"A 1-year-old from El Salvador clings to his mother after she turned them in to Border Patrol agents near Rio Grande City, Texas, in December.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56954c331a00002e00ab061b.jpeg?cache=d39WfjHGEw&ops=crop_19_423_4982_2569%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The numbers of undocumented mothers and children apprehended along the southern border are up significantly from last fiscal year, according to data released by the U.S. government on Tuesday. Customs and Border Protection agents picked up about 21,500 family units in October, November and December, the first three months of the 2016 fiscal year. During the same period the year before, agents had apprehended about 7,500 families. The number of unaccompanied minors apprehended crossing the border has also risen, from nearly 8,000 in the first three months of fiscal 2015 to about 17,400 in the same period this year. The Obama administration dealt with a similar surge in 2014. At that time, the rising numbers of families and unaccompanied minors overwhelmed a system that didn't have the room to house the apprehended or the capacity to work through all their cases quickly. This time, federal agencies are more prepared. A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that the Department of Homeland Security, ""along with the entire administration, has been closely monitoring these trends and coordinating across the whole of government to ensure an effective response to any changes in migration flows."" That includes working with the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure they have the capacity to house unaccompanied minors.HHS has about 9,500 beds for unaccompanied minors and will add some 2,200 more in coming months, a spokeswoman said. Congress allocated $750 million last year to address the problems in Central America that are causing mothers and children to flee. Still, HHS ""may face serious funding challenges"" given the increase in unaccompanied children, Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell wrote to members of Congress in December.The surge poses a problem for an administration that is juggling border security issues with concerns about protecting mothers and children, many of whom have sought asylum or other relief based on violence in their home countries.The White House is arguing with Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates over the latest deportation raids aimed at families who entered the country after May 1, 2014, and whose removal has since been ordered by judges. The critics contend that the women and children should be allowed to stay under temporary protected status because they could face dire consequences, even death, if sent back to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. But there are concerns that allowing people ordered for deportation to remain in the U.S. would send the message to others who come without authorization that they, too, may be able to stay.The White House has argued that the families being targeted for deportation have exhausted their legal options and that they fall into the administration's stated priorities for removal, because they entered the country after January 2014.White House Counsel Neil Eggleston went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to assuage Democrats' concerns ahead of a press conference they planned to criticize the raids. At the meeting, he emphasized the need to follow deportation priorities and enforce immigration law, according to an administration official who declined to be named. ""The administration continues to reinforce that while we recognize the serious underlying conditions that cause some people to flee their home countries, we cannot allow our borders to be open to illegal migration,"" the official said in an email. ""Those who come here illegally will be sent home after being provided an opportunity to have their cases heard, consistent with our laws and values.""This story has been updated to include comments from Customs and Border Protection.Also on HuffPost:"
