1,POLITICS,"Majority Of Voters In Iowa, New Hampshire Want Feds To Respect State Marijuana Laws",Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/voters-primary-state-marijuana-laws_us_55dca76be4b04ae497049b07,"Candidates who say they would shut down legal state marijuana businesses are “out of touch with the voters,” one advocate says.",2015-08-25,California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom at the 2014 California State Democratic convention,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559d6dcc1a00005c0024c04c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Voters in the two earliest presidential voting states overwhelmingly agree: states should be able to set their own marijuana laws without federal interference.Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling asked voters in Iowa and New Hampshire if states should be able to execute their own marijuana laws without the involvement of the federal government, or if the feds should arrest and prosecute those who are following state drug laws.The survey, released Tuesday, found a supermajority of voters in both states believe that the feds should not interfere with state marijuana laws -- 71 percent in Iowa and 73 percent in New Hampshire.Iowa and New Hampshire are often viewed as critical bellwether states, together helping to cement each party's presidential front-runner. The Iowa caucus in the first week of February serves as the launch into election season, quickly followed the next week by the first primary election in New Hampshire.The PPP poll also found substantial bipartisan support for states' rights when it comes to marijuana policy, with very large Democratic and independent majorities leading in both states, but with strong majority support from Republicans as well.Presidential hopefuls should take note of how strongly these voters want to end federal marijuana prohibition, Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, a drug policy reform group that commissioned the PPP poll, said in a statement. ""Candidates who say they would send in the DEA to shut down legal, taxpaying marijuana businesses are effectively announcing that they're out of the mainstream and out of touch with the voters they need support from in order to get elected,"" Angell said. ""That type of rhetoric is just not going to score any points in 2016.""To date, 23 states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes while 17 others have legalized the limited medical use of cannabis extracts, frequently used to treat debilitating seizures. New Hampshire legalized medical marijuana in 2013, and Iowa is one of the states that allows limited medical use of extracts. Four states and D.C. have legalized recreational marijuana. (The District still bans retail sales.) But marijuana, be it medical or recreational, remains prohibited under federal law. Under the Controlled Substances Act, the U.S. has five categories for drugs and drug ingredients. Schedule I is reserved for what the DEA considers to have the highest potential for abuse and no medical value. Marijuana has been classified as Schedule I for decades, alongside other substances like heroin and LSD.States that have legalized rely on Department of Justice guidance urging federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting their state-legal marijuana operations. While federal prosecutions of medical marijuana patients and providers have slowed more recently, the Drug Enforcement Administration and several U.S. attorneys under the Obama administration have raided marijuana dispensaries and sent people to prison, even though they complied with state laws. According to a 2013 report released by advocacy group Americans for Safe Access, the Obama administration spent almost $80 million each year -- more than $200,000 per day -- cracking down on medical marijuana. The PPP poll is some of the strongest sentiment yet from voters who want to see an end to prohibition-style marijuana policies. In April, CBS News found that 58 percent of Americans believe that legalizing marijuana should be left to each state, without involvement from the federal government. A recent report from centrist think tank Third Way found 60 percent of Americans feeling similarly and also found that a larger majority of Americans would also support the creation of a new federal law that would make those marijuana-legal states a ""safe haven"" from federal laws against cannabis.State legislators also appear to agree -- just this month, the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nongovernment organization composed of state lawmakers and their staffs, passed a resolution urging the federal government to amend the Controlled Substances Act and other federal laws ""to explicitly allow states to set their own marijuana and hemp policies without federal interference"" and to refrain from undermining state marijuana and hemp laws.The PPP surveys included 1,500 registered voters in Iowa and 841 voters in New Hampshire. The Iowa poll was conducted Aug. 7-9 and the New Hampshire poll was conducted Aug. 21-24.  Also on HuffPost:"

The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Monday that 79-year-old Cardinal William Joseph Levada, of Menlo Park, California, was stopped at about midnight Thursday in Kailua-Kona on the Big Island after a patrol car saw him swerve. Levada, formerly the highest ranking American official in the Vatican, was charged with driving under the influence and was released from police custody after posting $500 bail.In a statement emailed to The Huffington Post by a spokesman for the Archdiocese of San Francisco, Levada said, “I regret my error in judgment. I intend to continue fully cooperating with the authorities.”Levada, the former archbishop of Portland and San Francisco, was reportedly vacationing with other priests on the Big Island when the arrest occurred. When asked how the archdiocese handles situations like this, spokesman Michael Brown said that in this specific case, ""'punishment' is not a factor.""“Speaking generally at all levels of the organization, such things would be looked at on a case-by-case basis,"" he wrote in an email to HuffPost. ""Where a lapse in judgment occurred, the matter would probably be considered less serious. If the matter seemed to indicate a more serious problem, this would be treated more seriously. This would be true at all employee levels.""Catholic cardinals, traditionally seen as ""princes of the church,"" are appointed by the pope and are second to him in terms of church hierarchy. Currently, there are 219 cardinals worldwide, including 15 in the United States. In 2005, former Pope Benedict XVI named Levada as his successor as Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. One year later, Benedict named him a cardinal. Since his retirement as Prefect in 2012, Levada has held the position of Prefect emeritus of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. He was part of the conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Levada is scheduled to appear in Kona District Court Sept. 24. A police spokeswoman declined to provide the newspaper with Levada's blood alcohol content. "

The protesters were calling on Kerry to block Enbridge Energy from expanding its Alberta Clipper oil sands pipeline, which runs from Canada to Superior, Wisconsin.Last year, Minnesota’s White Earth Nation tribe, the Indigenous Environmental Network, the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity sued the State Department, claiming it illegally allowed Enbridge to expand its pipeline without a permit application and an environmental review. The Midwest Unrest protesters said on Tuesday that Kerry should step in and stop the company from completing the project.“Why in the world would we let them proceed without an environmental review?” said Greta Herrin, a student from Kalamazoo, Michigan, who attended the protest outside Kerry's residence Tuesday. “This is a corporation that has shown a complete disregard for the people and the Earth.”In 2010, another Enbridge pipeline leaked more than 800,000 gallons of tar sands oil into a Kalamazoo River tributary. It was the largest inland oil spill in the nation's history.The Midwest Unrest protesters, many of whom were bused from the Midwest to Washington overnight, marched to Kerry’s Georgetown residence from a small park nearby. Some held up signs quoting Kerry describing climate change as ""a weapon of mass destruction."" Others expressed confusion over why the Obama administration would take a more cautious approach toward approving a permit for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which has been under consideration at the State Department for years.“We're saying, 'Secretary Kerry, pay the same attention to this as you do to Keystone,'"" said Kenny Bruno, a longtime activist who also attended Tuesday's rally. ""They're both dirty, they're both not in the national interest, so you've got to reject it.”The protest drew students, recent graduates and veteran environmental activists.""I'm mad, and I don't like people lying to us. They promised us clean air and energy and water, and they didn't do it,"" said Joy Sides, 73, who travelled from Jacksonville, Illinois, to participate in the protest.After four hours of protest, police arrested 20 demonstrators who were blocking the sidewalk outside Kerry's house.The State Department did not immediately respond for comment."

8,POLITICS,St. Louis County v. The Press: Round 1 Begins Without The Reporters,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-reporters-case_us_55db8878e4b08cd3359cfa37,A St. Louis County spokesman suggests community service is on the table in similar cases.,2015-08-25,"<p>Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly is taken away by police during the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in August last year.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c93b091700006e0056721a.jpeg?cache=L07ftXbkKm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The showdown between St. Louis County and the two reporters who were charged with essentially doing their jobs in Ferguson, Missouri, last August began quietly enough on Monday. Court activity in the case was postponed until Oct. 5 as the lawyers maneuver.It's too soon to say what that means for The Huffington Post's Ryan J. Reilly and The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery, but the prosecuting authority in their case, the St. Louis County Counselor, has clearly been busy.And judging from the ""hundreds"" of court summonses that defense attorneys say were recently sent out, it appears that County Counselor Peter Krane is ready to argue that a lot of good arrests were made amid the turmoil in Ferguson last year.Despite widespread complaints from media organizations that Reilly and Lowery in particular did nothing to merit the charges, Krane doesn't seem convinced.""I'm not surprised that they would claim that they were not doing anything wrong,"" Krane said last week, according to St. Louis Public Radio. ""But I looked at the police report, and I feel that they did do something wrong.""So how serious are the charges that Reilly and Lowery face in the North Division of the St. Louis County Municipal Court?The reporters were each charged with trespassing on private property and interfering with a police officer during the performance of his duty. All this stems from an encounter at the Ferguson McDonald's on Aug. 13, 2014, when the journalists allegedly did not vacate the fast-food establishment as fast as the police wanted.The offenses with which they've been charged are governed by the part of the St. Louis County municipal code that regulates ""public safety and morals."" Each offense is punishable by up to one year in jail, a fine of $1,000 or both.But the threat of jail time is likely only on paper. In real life, the alleged misdeeds under Missouri law barely rise to the level of ""ordinance violations"" -- think of the kind of broken-windows policing that has been a hot topic in New York and elsewhere. A St. Louis County reference guide calls these ordinances ""regulations that commonly affect everyday life.""None of these quality-of-life offenses are being pursued by Robert McCulloch, St. Louis County’s prosecuting attorney. A spokesman for the county confirmed to The Huffington Post that McCulloch referred all the nonviolent cases stemming from the Ferguson unrest to the county counselor's office.""There were so many cases that came in,"" said Cordell Whitlock, director of communications for St. Louis County. ""The workload was such that it had to be divvied up.""Last week, Krane had denied that McCulloch or the city of Ferguson turned down the prosecutions prior to the referral to his office. He said that the ""charges came to my office and my office only for review.""The county counselor's office also defends the county and its agencies, like the police department, against lawsuits.Whitlock said that most of these new cases against those once arrested are ""probably not even that serious,"" and he suggested that Krane would be seeking community service in many of them.It isn’t clear if any offer of community service is on the table for Reilly and Lowery. Besides reducing potential punishment, any deal that the two reporters -- or any of the others arrested and now charged -- might strike with authorities could theoretically address their rights to bring related future cases, such as those alleging that the police violated their First Amendment rights.The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri has set up an online form to help find legal representation for anyone charged during the protests a year ago."

Stuart was a Confederate general and a slave owner, and Julianne Moore is just one of thousands of people who think his name should be removed from a Virginia high school. Moore joined Academy Award-winning producer Bruce Cohen to launch a Change.org petition calling on the local school board change the name of J.E.B. High School. Both stars once attended the Fairfax County, Virginia, school.The petition is proposing to rename the school Thurgood Marshall High School. Marshall was the lawyer and eventual Supreme Court justice who argued against segregation in public schools in the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education. The school was named for Stuart when it was founded in 1959 to protest that ruling.Alumni who signed the petition say they've felt the need to apologize for their alma mater's name ever since:When we were at J.E.B. Stuart in the late ’70’s, the school symbol was Stuart riding a horse and waving the Confederate flag. The Confederate flag was at the center of our basketball court and on our athletic letter jackets and wasn’t removed until 2001 -- but the symbol of Stuart on a horse waving a flag (now solid blue) remains. No one should have to apologize for the name of the public high school you attended and the history of racism it represents, as we and so many alumni of Stuart have felt the need to do our whole lives.The petition has received almost 30,000 signatures since its launch four weeks ago, and has since been promoted by the likes of Russell Simmons and the local NAACP chapter. In a statement to ABC News, the Fairfax County School Board said they plan to review this request. ""We recognize that there are legitimate concerns of students, parents and communities in these schools and whether those names best reflect their community,"" the statement read. ""We also recognize that there are historic, legacy, and financial concerns in making changes in the names of schools. Current and former students have initiated this dialogue and we will work with our communities to hear all sides of this discussion and work collaboratively to address this issue.""Moore was not immediately available for further comment.

He might want to check the latest polling from Gallup, which found Latinos were more likely to say they disliked than liked him by a 51-point margin.His results were disastrous compared to every other Republican presidential candidate on the survey, as illustrated by this chart released on Monday:It's not surprising that Trump is unpopular with Latinos. He opened his campaign by claiming the Mexican government was sending rapists and other criminals into the U.S. as undocumented immigrants, and his stance has hardened from there. Last week, he proposed ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S., and vowed to deport all undocumented immigrants.Gallup notes that it did not poll Latinos on Trump before his announcement speech, so there's no clear mark for how it affected his image. In their polling since, he's been consistently viewed unfavorably.Although Latinos don't typically rank immigration as the top issue for choosing a candidate, harsh rhetoric against undocumented immigrants was considered a major factor in the GOP's dismal result with Latinos in the 2012 presidential election. Trump has succeeded in drawing Latinos' attention, at the very least. Gallup reports that 8 in 10 of those polled had formed an opinion on Trump, compared to about 6 in 10 who had formed an opinion of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. None of the other candidates hit the 50 percent mark for familiarity with Latinos.Bush is faring the best with Latinos, who were more likely to say they viewed him favorably than unfavorably by an 11-point margin. His margin of favorability has actually gone up, although it's yet to be seen whether there will be fallout from his recent stumbles over the term ""anchor babies.""   The former governor has taken a more moderate tack on immigration than Trump, and opposes changing the 14th Amendment to end birthright citizenship. Among Democrats, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has a major advantage. She has a net 40 favorability score, and about 75 percent of Latinos know who she is. Only 25 percent of Latinos were familiar with Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders. The results were even worse for former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Sen. and Gov.

When it was revealed to be Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, a character allied with a military group called The First Order, fans speculated further.  Who is Kylo Ren ?  Is he a Sith?  What is The First Order? Director J.J. Abrams clarified some details about his new ""Episode VII"" character in a recent interview with Empire magazine. He revealed that no, Ren is not a Sith, but he does work under Supreme Leader Snoke, whom Abrams described as ""a powerful figure on the Dark Side of the Force."" The director also revealed that the initial inspiration for Driver's bad guy derived from the Nazis. Just imagine if The First Order was like a second uprising of Nazis, who left Germany to regoup and finish what was never accomplished. Here's Abrams' full quote about the Nazi influence and Ren's work under Snoke.That all came out of conversations about, what would have happened if the Nazis all went to Argentina but then started working together again? What could be born of that? Could The First Order exist as a group that actually admired The Empire? Could the work of The Empire be seen as unfulfilled? And could Vader be a martyr? Could there be a need to see through what didn’t get done?In a sense, then, Ren is like a Nazi of another galaxy, only much worse. Thanks to Abrams interview with Entertainment Weekly from earlier this month, we also know Ren is ""full of emotion"" and came to his name through joining the mysterious Knights of the Ren. Could that group have Nazi inspirations as well? We'll have to wait to see just how evil Ren is when ""The Force Awakens"" hits theaters on Dec. 18.For more, head to Empire.

13,IMPACT,How One Actress-Activist Is Working To End Dogfighting In Los Angeles,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/los-angeles-dogfighting-tipline_us_55db787ee4b04ae497040c40,Rebecca Corry hopes a new tip line will help land more animal abusers behind bars.,2015-08-25,<p>The dogfighting tipline is now being advertised on all of Los Angeles County's 100 animal care trucks.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55db7d181d00006e00145b8b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the second year, The Huffington Post is holding a week-long, community-driven effort to bust the myths and raise awareness about pit bulls, a maligned ""breed"" that often bears the brunt of dated, discriminatory legislation that can make it near impossible for these dogs to find a forever home. You can follow along with HuffPost Pit Bull Week here, or on social media where we'll be using the hashtag #PitBullWeek.Dogfighting, the “sport” where dogs are bred and trained to fight each other to the death, is a felony in all 50 states -- but it's still a crime that appears to be both relatively common and infrequently prosecuted.Rebecca Corry, an actress, comic and writer, is trying to change that -- in the Los Angeles area, at least.Through her nonprofit Stand Up for Pits Foundation, which was also responsible for last year’s Million Pibble March on Washington, Corry has launched a new tip line -- 877-777-2585 -- allowing individuals in Los Angeles County to confidentially report incidents of dogfighting that they witness or suspect.Their incentive? A reward of up to $5,000 provided by the Humane Society of the United States in the event of an arrest or conviction as the result of a tip provided through the line, which launched on July 1. “It sickens me to my core that animals would be forced, and that’s the word, forced, to fight to the death for money, entertainment or human pleasure in any way,” Corry told The Huffington Post. “It’s absolutely disgusting and it’s everywhere, being done by all kinds of people, all over the place. It’s time to end it, period.”Though other existing tip lines -- like CrimeStoppers and the HSUS’s national dogfighting tip line -- already allow citizens to alert law enforcement to suspected animal abuse including dogfighting (and if a dogfight in progress is witnessed, a 911 call should be made), the Stand Up for Pits line takes a slightly different approach.Covering only the immediate Los Angeles County area, the tip line allows private investigators working with the organization to look into tips they receive in an effort to determine if a tip is legitimate and to provide more thorough information to law enforcement.Receiving a more comprehensive tip can make a big difference for time-crunched law enforcement, Christine Murray, a retired police officer who works as one of the line’s two investigators, explained to HuffPost.“Our hope is to kind of vet the tips and have an investigator look at what they’ve got to determine if the tips are workable,” Murray said. “So we can serve up to law enforcement a very robust tip rather than a vague one, to show them that this is one you want to work because it has potential and it’s not just a dog barking call.”The tip line, which is funded through charity comedy events and the sales of apparel on the organization's website, is also operated not as an answering service but, instead, with live operators answering calls that come in around the clock.These are key differences that make Deborah Knaan, head of the animal cruelty division at Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, confident that Corry’s line could succeed where other efforts have fallen short. Knaan was consulted by Corry as she went about building the line, a process that took about a year.“It’s very localized which means it’s going to get a lot of attention by the people working the tips and the people working the tips will be very familiar with LA County,” Knaan told HuffPost. Because dogfighting operations operate in an underground economy, it is practically impossible to know exactly how pervasive the problem is, but the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals estimates that tens of thousands of people are involved with the practice in the U.S. and many officials believe that number may be climbing.According to Chris Schindler, HSUS animal rescue team manager of animal fighting response, the organization's tip line is receiving a steadily climbing number of tips each year and is on pace to surpass 5,000 tips for the first time this year.While dogfighting cases come up in a diverse set of settings -- urban, rural and everything in between -- the Los Angeles area appears to be home to more than its fair share of it.Over the past 10 years, felony dogfighting charges have been filed against 16 defendants in the county, according to data from the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.In a high-profile case late last year, Pauline Winbush, an assistant superintendent at Palmdale Unified School District, was charged along with her boyfriend with four felony counts of dogfighting, 17 felony counts of animal cruelty and one felony count of child abuse. Winbush pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial in the case wherein investigators found almost 20 injured or malnourished pit bulls and a dead puppy and other animals at the couple’s home in Lancaster.At a statewide level, California is home to among the highest number of dogfighting cases in recent years in the nation. The degree to which the tip line is successful in combatting all of that depends, of course, on how many people become aware of it.“A lot of times people know it is happening in their community but are afraid to report,"" Knaan said. ""And until somebody reports, nothing can be done.""Since the line began, Corry said they've already received viable tips and she hopes that trend will continue. Corry plans to promote the number through billboard ads and the distribution of flyers in communities and animal shelters in the months ahead. In addition, all of the county’s 100 Animal Care and Control trucks are, as of earlier this month, sporting the tip line number.It's with good reason that the tip line is a priority for the county.Marcia Mayeda, the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control director, explained that they are supporting the line not only because of the viciousness of the fighting and the effect it has on the dogs, but also on the documented connections between dogfighting and other forms of animal abuse and crimes directed at humans such as domestic abuse, child abuse and sexual violence. Illegal drugs and gambling are also commonly connected with dogfighting cases. “Dogfighting is just part of a larger situation in which animals and people are harmed,” Mayeda said.While a range of dog breeds are used for fighting, pit bulls and pit bull-type dogs are most at risk of becoming victims of the practice in the U.S., according to the ASPCA. Even when dogs are rescued from a fighting operation, they often require significant rehabilitation before they are able to be safely housed and must be evaluated before an adoption is even considered. But even with all the obstacles, it is all worth it to Corry, who hopes to see others create similarly localized tip lines on the issue in the future.“We believe that if every county and state had a tip line running, people would know what to do and communities would empower themselves to get animal abusers arrested and put away, which is where they belong,” Corry added. “You’ve got some seriously broken people with some serious issues and these dogs are the voiceless victims of it. They’re helpless.”Also on HuffPost:"
14,POLITICS,New Documentary Makes The Case For Supervised Heroin Injection Sites In New York,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-documentary-makes-the-case-for-supervised-heroin-injection-sites-in-new-york_us_55dc7b46e4b0a40aa3ac26bc,"""If we don't come up with a plan, we're going to lose a lot of human life.""",2015-08-25,"<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: #eeeeee;"">Drug paraphernalia is seen lying on the street in the new documentary ""Everywhere But Safe.""</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55dc9ffc170000b700568853.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new documentary is shedding light on the thousands of residents of New York state who inject heroin in public or semi-public places, with dire consequences for their health and their communities. ""Everywhere But Safe,"" which will premiere this week in Manhattan, features interviews with heroin users in New York City, Albany and Schenectady, as well as in Columbia County, a more rural area upstate. Most of the people interviewed in the film have at various times injected drugs in places like hallways, subways, alleyways, parks, parked cars, restaurant bathrooms, streets and other public areas, primarily due to homelessness. This kind of public injection, as the film makes clear, can often create a public health emergency.""If we don't come up with a plan, we're going to lose a lot of human life,"" one man says in the documentary's trailer. That's because people who shoot up in public spaces are statistically more susceptible to overdoses and disease. A forthcoming report from the Injection Drug Users Health Alliance shows that a majority of needle exchange participants in New York City injected in public spaces in the past year, and were therefore more than twice as likely to have overdosed as users who didn't. They were also twice as likely not to have a steady supply of sterile injection equipment, and four times as likely to reuse injection equipment, which often leads to the transmission of disease. “In New York, we're seeing people in our community dying of overdose, contracting HIV and hepatitis C and being pushed to the edges because of the shame and stigma associated with injection drug use,” said Taeko Frost, one of the film's two directors and the executive director of the Washington Heights CORNER Project, a needle exchange program. “As harm reduction providers, we're engaging individuals on safer drug use and providing the tools and resources to prevent overdose and transmission, but the reality is there isn't a consistent, safe space to apply these strategies."" The problems of public injection have been compounded in recent years by the sharp rise in the homeless population, particularly in New York City, and the surge in heroin use across the northeastern U.S., including in New York state.There are at least 56,000 people in New York City sleeping in homeless shelters each night -- a near-record high, according to the latest count. And in 2013, more people in New York City died of heroin overdoses than of murder. Meanwhile, nationwide, the number of heroin-related deaths jumped by 39 percent in 2013. “Public injecting is real problem in New York, but fortunately it is one for which we have a clear solution supported by a large body of research,” said Julie Netherland, deputy director of the New York policy office at the Drug Policy Alliance, in a statement Monday. “Countries around the world have opened supervised injection facilities to address the kinds of public health and safety problems so poignantly illustrated in 'Everywhere But Safe.' It’s time for New York to follow the science and implement evidence-based strategies, such as SIFs, that can save lives."" Australia, Canada and some European countries operate SIFs, or supervised injection facilities, where users can inject heroin with sterile equipment in a clean environment, under professional supervision. There are currently no such facilities in the U.S. Matt Curtis hopes ""Everywhere But Safe"" can help change that. Curtis, who co-directed the film with Frost and serves as policy director at VOCAL-New York, an advocacy group that also operates a needle exchange, told The Huffington Post he hopes the documentary will ""humanize"" the problem of public injection and make the idea of supervised injection sites more palatable to an American audience.“New York is not taking responsibility for this problem,” Curtis said in a statement. “We do not have to have thousands of New Yorkers injecting in public.""Creating SIFs, he said, would ""remove a major public health threat, make our communities safer, and save the city money.” It would also be a step away from the drug war's aggressive, enforcement-heavy approach to the country's heroin epidemic -- an approach in which most users are simply thrown in jail -- and a step toward what's called a ""harm reduction"" model. In the 1980s, under the philosophy of harm reduction, the city opened its first needle exchanges to help stop the spread of HIV. More recently, the city has equipped its police and emergency responders with naloxone, a drug that can prevent death in people who have overdosed on heroin.""Everywhere But Safe"" premieres Friday, Aug. 28, at the Maysles Documentary Center in Harlem. Curtis said the movie marks the beginning of a campaign by a new group called SIF NYC, which next month will begin a push for SIFs in the city. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article mistakenly identified Curtis as the executive director of VOCAL-New York. He is the group's policy director."

""We believe the facts will show the FTC's allegations are unfounded,"" he added.FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez welcomed the decision.""It is not only appropriate, but critical, that the FTC has the ability to take action on behalf of consumers when companies fail to take reasonable steps to secure sensitive consumer information,"" she said.Congress has not adopted wide-ranging legislation governing data security, a growing concern after high-profile breaches such as at retailer Target Corp, infidelity website Ashley Madison, and even U.S. government databases.In a test of its power to fill the void, the FTC sued Wyndham in June 2012, claiming its computers ""unreasonably and unnecessarily"" exposed consumer data to the risk of theft.Wyndham accused the FTC of overreaching, but U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark, New Jersey, let the case proceed.Affirming that ruling, Ambro rejected Wyndham's argument that it lacked ""fair notice"" about what the FTC could require.He also rejected what he called Wyndham's ""alarmist"" argument that letting the FTC regulate its conduct could give the agency effective authority to regulate hotel room door locks, or sue supermarkets that fail to sweep up banana peels.""It invites the tart retort that, were Wyndham a supermarket, leaving so many banana peels all over the place that 619,000 customers fall hardly suggests it should be immune from liability,"" Ambro wrote.The case is Federal Trade Commission v Wyndham Worldwide Corp et al, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-3514.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Alina Selyukh in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Alan Crosby)"

Chris Christie (R) features images taken from Islamic State propaganda videos, marking a growing trend among Republican candidates seeking to attack President Barack Obama. The 30-second campaign video, “Law Enforcer,” was released on Monday. Christie lists a series of examples of “lawlessness in America and around the world” during Obama's presidency. He intones that these acts of lawlessness include “ISIS beheading Christians"" as stills of the Islamic State's flag and militants poised to behead prisoners appear on screen. In addition to featuring images of the Islamic State, Christie's new ad contains other graphic photos to support his argument that Obama has enabled crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, a rise in heroin abuse and Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear weapon.The New Jersey governor then promises to reverse these trends as commander in chief. “We need a strong law enforcer as president,” he concludes. “Someone who says what he means, and means what he says.”The video is Christie's third ad as a Republican presidential candidate, and it will air nationally on Fox News, according to his campaign.As the ad demonstrates, Christie is attempting to stake out ground as the Republican presidential field’s most qualified and unyielding national security hawk. The governor was a U.S. attorney in New Jersey from 2002 to 2008, and defended the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance programs in a heated exchange with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) during the first Republican presidential primary debate. Media watchdogs have criticized the way news outlets and politicians are using video from Islamic State beheadings to exploit the tragic murders and rack up page views or votes. Critics argue that republishing explicit images from the beheadings plays into the extremist group’s media-based terror strategy. Christie's campaign ad can be viewed above. The campaign defended its use of the images in a statement to HuffPost.""The ad addresses one of the biggest issues on the minds of Americans right now,"" said Samantha Smith, a Christie campaign spokeswoman. ""In town hall meetings across the country, one of the first questions people ask is about foreign relations and the growing threat of ISIS. This is the reality we face and the ad clearly shows that."" Christie is not the first 2016 Republican hopeful to release a campaign ad featuring graphic images of the militant group. A PAC supporting former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee used footage from an Islamic State propaganda video in a pre-campaign launch video on May 1.Several Republican Senate and House candidates also used images of Islamic State beheadings in campaign videos during the 2014 midterm elections. For example, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) -- who is now one of the loudest critics of Obama’s Iran nuclear deal -- won his seat after using footage from an Islamic State propaganda video in one of his campaign advertisements.CORRECTION: This article previously stated that Christie's ad contained explicit images of Islamic State beheadings; the ad contains images taken from Islamic State videos but shows no beheadings taking place.Also on HuffPost:"

One of the club's members says they were treated unfairly because they were black. A group of women with the book club Sisters on the Reading Edge boarded the luxurious Napa Valley Wine Train around 11 a.m. on Saturday for an annual excursion to wine country. But soon, the group, which was made up of 10 black women and one white woman, was asked to leave the train. Lisa Renee Johnson, a member of the club, told the Napa Valley Register that she and the other women were just having a good time: chatting, snapping pictures and streaming their experience on Periscope. But an employee aboard the train told them that other passengers had complained that they were being too loud. Johnson says that they were ""singled out"" because they were black.""It was humiliating. I’m really offended to be quite honest,” Johnson, 47, told SFGate. ""I felt like it was a racist attack on us. I feel like we were being singled out.""Accounts of the episode spread across social media this weekend under the hashtag #LaughingWhileBlack.In a statement Sunday, Wine Train spokeswoman Kira Devitt said that ""several parties in the same car"" complained, and that the group was warned to ""keep the noise to an acceptable level."" Johnson insists that she and her friends weren't doing anything wrong. ""She said people were complaining and I said, 'Who’s complaining?' And she said, 'Well, people’s faces are uncomfortable,'"" Johnson told the Napa Valley Register. ""At that point, one passenger nearby said, 'Well, this is not a bar.' We reacted, 'Yes, it is a bar, a bar on wheels.'""When the train pulled into St. Helena, there were police waiting at the station. Johnson told the Register that the group was ""paraded through the cars"" before exiting.The women were transported via van to Napa, where they received a refund. Johnson says she wants a public apology from the company. Chief Jeff Hullquist of the Napa Valley Railroad Police Department told the Independent UK that police are called as a precaution when anyone is let off a train. No arrests or citations were given.Devitt told the Register that it's not uncommon for people to be removed from the train. On her Facebook page, Johnson posted photos with other people on the train who she said weren't bothered by their group's laughter. She pointed out that other customers not with their party have criticized the Wine Train's handling of the incident.The company's Yelp profile has been flooded with one-star reviews in the wake of the incident."

One would imagine that what most party leaders and conservative pundits are hoping for now is some kind of winnowing of the field from the pretenders to the contenders.But there is one obvious exception: Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, who -- for some reason -- wants more candidates to enter the race. And by ""more,"" I mean nine additional dudes.What is it about the current field of 17 candidates that doesn't cut it for Kristol? Well, in this week's piece, ""An October Surprise for the GOP"" (in which the ""October Surprise"" comes one year sooner than a traditional ""October Surprise""), Kristol doesn't actually get around to laying out any specific reasons. He can't say that ""the GOP isn't on course to nominating their very own Dukakis,"" and he suspects Donald Trump has forced a ""distorted view of the quality of the field,"" but that's about it. Kristol just ... isn't sure, man.But there is one thing that he suspects to be true. ""Well,"" writes Kristol, ""it's not as if every well-qualified contender is already on the field.""O RLY? Per Kristol:Mitch Daniels was probably the most successful Republican governor of recent times, with federal executive experience to boot. Paul Ryan is the intellectual leader of Republicans in the House of Representatives, with national campaign experience. The House also features young but tested leaders like Jim Jordan, Trey Gowdy and Mike Pompeo. There is the leading elected representative of the 9/11 generation who has also been a very impressive freshman senator, Tom Cotton. There could be a saner and sounder version of Trump -- another businessman who hasn't held electoral office. And there are distinguished conservative leaders from outside politics; Justice Samuel Alito and General (ret.) Jack Keane come to mind.Won't some of these guys run for president? After all, if they don't get in the race and start competing, Bill Kristol might never get around to identifying the five or six people he really, REALLY wants to see run for president. Although maybe we're learning that Kristol's true dream ticket is ""Diazepam/A Long Nap 2016.""(Sidebar: You have to feel a little bit bad for Carly Fiorina here, whom Kristol would pass over in favor of some ""saner and sounder ... businessman who hasn't held electoral office."" Gotta be one of those out there somewhere!) But look, this is old hat. Kristol's uncertainty about the quality of the GOP field is basically a return to the column-stuffing schtick he regularly deployed four years ago. As you may recall, Kristol spent most of the latter half of 2011 inside his Glass Case Of Emotion, constantly lamenting Mitt Romney's status as front-runner and constantly writing regular articles about how no one was inevitable, how better candidates were always available to join the race, and how there was always -- ALWAYS! -- enough time for a savior to make a late bid for the Republican nomination. On Sept. 23, 2011, Kristol reacted to that week's primary debate by saying, ""Yikes ... maybe the GOP presidential boat needs rocking."" In an Oct. 25 dispatch, he bragged that ""81 percent of the GOP primary voters"" were ""in play"" and that the ""race seem[ed] to be more open and fluid than conventional wisdom has it."" Kristol's post-Thanksgiving tryptophan hangover led to a brief screed denying that Romney was ""inevitable"" and insisting that ""a late January entry by another candidate isn't out of the question."" Come Dec. 8, Kristol was endorsing a Rhodes Cook piece about how it wasn't ""too late for a candidate to enter the race"" and suggesting there was a ""window of opportunity"" for such a candidate to get in around Valentine's Day. On Dec. 19, Kristol wrote a piece begging for some ""non-Hughes, non-Dewey, non-Nixon, non-Dole Republican candidate to present himself"" by Presidents' Day weekend to save the GOP from Romney. By December's end, Kristol was suggesting that the GOP's only hope was a brokered convention. During that time, Kristol never ran out of potential game-changing dark horse candidates, offering Rudy Giuliani, John Thune, Mitch Daniels, Mike Pence, Paul Ryan, Mike Huckabee, Sarah Palin, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Chris Christie as the certain rescuers of the GOP's White House ambitions. And throughout it all, Kristol was inspired by the illustrious voices of history's specters, like the ""ghosts of Lincoln and FDR"" or Harry Truman or Alexander Hamilton or Geoffrey Chaucer or William Butler Yeats.In fact, this ground has been so well trod by Kristol that poor Yeats is being conscripted into his second ""Please, please somebody else run for president"" tour of duty. This week, Kristol draws on Yeats' ""The Second Coming"" to wonder, ""But what if come October all we have is Bushies lacking all conviction, Trumpers full of passionate intensity, and a bunch of uninspiring also-rans?"" Now, let's flash back to Sept. 23, 2011:A third e-mailer Thursday evening, watching the debate, was reminded of Yeats's ""The Second Coming:""There's a special irony there. The New Jersey governor is one of a handful of 2016 candidates whom Kristol desperately wanted to run in 2012. Now, Kristol isn't sure that Christie -- along with Rubio, Bush and Huckabee -- is worthy of seeking the nomination at all. The man is like Prince's mom: never satisfied.One can only wonder how Kristol is going to hold it together this time out. Here he is, standing at the threshold of his mid-autumn anxiety attack and it's only August. But maybe it's not too late for Kristol to find some way to chill, if only for a few months. After all, the way he ends his piece suggests that he's not chosen the path of panic just yet.It may seem odd to suggest that the solution to an already unprecedentedly large field is to expand it further. But politics is full of oddities. And what would be truly odd would be to go into battle in 2016 with a candidate we settle on rather than a nominee the country can rally behind. The presidency would be a terrible thing to waste.One thing's for sure: I believe Kristol when he says that the presidency would be a terrible thing to waste because he ended his Dec. 19, 2011, column the exact same way.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

Speaking on HBO's ""Last Week Tonight"" on Sunday, Oliver pointed out that while gay couples now have the right to get married, they don't have many other rights in much of the nation.In some cases, they have no rights at all. Now Oliver is calling on the feds to extend basic civil rights protections to the gay community. ""States have a checkered history when it comes to civil rights,"" Oliver said. ""Just look at Arkansas right now. Not only do they not have any anti-discrimination ordinances, earlier this year they actually passed an anti-anti-discrimination ordinance that prevents any city or county from extending civil rights protections to gay people.""As Oliver pointed out, that's the opposite of progress.""It would be like if Apple suddenly introduced the iPhone 7 and it was a flip phone,"" he said. ""That's still not as dumb as the Apple Watch... but it's dumb."" Check it out in the clip above. Also on HuffPost:"
