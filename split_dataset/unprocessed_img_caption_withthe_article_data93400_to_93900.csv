3,HEALTHY LIVING,Just Breathe,"Leigh Weinraub, ContributorChampion Motivator and Founder, Mind in Motion  info@getyourmi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/just-breathe_b_6934402.html,"Here's a challenge: name the word and/or action that will get you through your own slump. Write it down (and share it below!). Put it where you'll see it. Look at it again and again. Take it in. Own it. Complete it. Be it. Repeat it. When you do, you'll blow beyond your negative self-perceptions and external projections, fixing your gaze instead on powerful truths inside you.",2015-03-26,2015-03-24-1427228519-1417417-huffpost_MIM_breathe.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-24-1427228519-1417417-huffpost_MIM_breathe-thumb.png,"She was the former club champ with formidable groundstrokes, but you wouldn't know it. She'd built a mental block that was crippling her game and melting her self-confidence. Once fluid and powerful, she now staggered anxiously to the baseline, the ball feeling like a grenade in her hand. How'd she get here? Words. Not just words she'd heard but words she'd said repetitively to herself, words like, ""I suck,"" ""I've lost it,"" ""I'm done.""   Like many athletes, she linked wins to worth. The ruminations that built in her head about how others viewed and valued her had become her toughest opponent. She was losing to herself, which is often the toughest loss to swallow.  By the time I started coaching her, the obsession with external judgment had grown so strong that she was caving under its pressure. Between mind chatter and spiking Cortisol, she was so paralyzed with fear that she could barely swing her racquet. I experienced this myself as a competitor. Over the last 15 years of my coaching and therapy career, I've listened to countless stories about how judgment is what we fear more than anything. We tell ourselves that if we are judged negatively, and therefore lose positive regard and affection, the devastating effects are unbearable. Forget whether this judgment is real or perceived. Once we think we're being judged--the moment we project self-criticism--the judgment and criticism are real. We can take other people out of the equation--we're doing it to ourselves.  I've also learned in many years as an athlete and coach that one of the worst things to say to a stressed athlete is ""just relax."" In the heat of a battle, telling someone to ""just relax"" is nebulous, trite and ineffective. What an athlete needs to practice most in those high pressure moments--what anyone needs--are simple and controllable actions that they can complete and repeat again and again and again. They need the guarantee of back pocket (or bottom of their uniform) victories. This is what actually helps people reach their undefined outcomes like relaxation and flow.   After a few weeks of watching this student struggle, something clicked in my own thinking. I knew that if she could just breathe, she could start to regain her power. Maybe that sounds simplistic, but it was true. Somatically speaking, she was so flooded with stress that she'd forgotten to breathe.   We approached the topic from a few angles. Breathing helps with focus. Breathing is a way to manage rhythm. Breathing increases oxygen flow, thus improving brain and muscle function. She started to get it and quickly began to move with greater ease, but one bad shot, lost point, or a glance at a spectator watching her would send her into a spiral. She needed a constant reminder. But what? I couldn't exactly stand on the sidelines yelling ""BREATHE!"" during her matches.   It was late at night and I was lying in bed when the answer struck me. In order to combat the negative words in her mind, she needed to have this one powerful, actionable word in front of her where she could see it. And not only in front of her, but as close to her as possible, even if it meant wearing it.   I grabbed a black marker and a white T-shirt, sat on the floor and wrote the word ""breathe"" upside down on the shirt, so the word would appear right-side up to the person wearing it. After all, the word was for her alone. No one else mattered. Every time she looked down during her match, she would see, read, and internalize this constant reminder.   The next day I gave my student the shirt, and reminded her to ""walk to the line, look down, and draw the simple solution from within.""   Was the shirt the solution? I believe that the work we did, from our very first session all the way up to the shirt played a role. In the end, she started winning again. And smiling. More importantly, as on-court success continued, the larger success revealed itself: she discovered a new way to approach her stressful moments, empower her own actions, and simplify the dialogue in her head. Her clothing became a reminder that keyed a mental shift, which triggered a physical response. Her body and mind were in motion together.   Word spread to other students. One shirt led to another, which led to another. Eventually there were dozens of shirts containing self-directed, one-word messages designed to help others take control. Ten years later, I have an apparel line, MbyMindInMotion--clothing that inspires, encourages and moves people toward confidence and possibility. Was this my intent when I made my first shirt? Not even close.   Here's a question I ask people all the time: How would your life change if you could physically look down every day at a single word that prompted an emotional shift? If ""seeing is believing,"" how can your eyes trigger your deepest motivation? Can you silence your own negative chatter, and focus instead on something tangible and powerful that is both in front of and within you? What if you could turn your apparel into something you wear from the Inside, Out? Imagine the widespread effect this would have on people you interact with daily? Perhaps your sense of style could inspire the words you want to internalize, and then become the feelings you wish to project. Ultimately, you could create a contagious boomerang effect of greatness all around you.   Here's a challenge: name the word and/or action that will get you through your own slump. Write it down (and share it below!). Put it where you'll see it. Look at it again and again. Take it in. Own it. Complete it. Be it. Repeat it. When you do, you'll blow beyond your negative self-perceptions and external projections, fixing your gaze instead on powerful truths inside you.Follow Leigh and Mind in Motion at  or http://getyourmindinmotion.comFacebook at https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mind-in-Motion/177407369069539 or drop us a line at info@getyourmindinmotion.com."
4,HEALTHY LIVING,"Sugar, Maybe Not So Sweet","Karen J. Inwald, ContributorResearches and advises businesses, organizations and individua...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sugar-maybe-not-so-sweet_b_6934764.html,,2015-03-26,2015-03-24-1427227179-3305303-ht_mayor_bloomberg_nanny_ad_jt_120602_vblog.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-24-1427227179-3305303-ht_mayor_bloomberg_nanny_ad_jt_120602_vblog-thumb.jpg,"Back in 2013, a judge threw out a ban on super-sized sugary drinks that then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg attempted to enact. Mayor Bloomberg was ridiculed and even photo-shopped as a nanny.In February 2015 the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Council in its recommendations to the federal government called for a tax on sugary beverages to curb consumption of sugar by the American public.On March 10, 2015 the NYC Board of Health voted to amend the rules governing consumption of fruit juices in day care centers administered by the City of New York. The current mayor Bill de Blasio approved the amendments, though he was critical of Mayor Bloomberg's former beverage initiatives. In an effort to curb childhood obesity and improve health, the new rules state that a child must be 2 years or older before consuming fruit juices and that consumption should be capped at four ounces per day. This differs from the previous rule of a minimum of 8 months of age and a maximum of 6 ounces of juice per day.While fruit juice may appear benign when compared to soda, it is, in fact, just as sugary. When the whole fruit is consumed, the fiber mitigates the effects of the sugar on the human body. Fruit juice is simple sugar water with some trace vitamins.Of course the board also suggests limiting television viewing and increasing physical activity.This shift in public health policy clearly indicates an increasing understanding of the hazards of sugar consumption. Over the last 50 years there really have been contradictory nutritional recommendations. First we must limit fat intake. Then we must limit or even eliminate eggs in order to curb dietary cholesterol. Oh how many watery all-white egg omelets! Finally let us eschew butter for margarine. No, wait. The trans fat. It is no wonder the public is thoroughly confused.We did follow many of these recommendations. For example, butter decreased from a U.S. per capita consumption of about 18 pounds in 1910 to a low of 3.5 pounds 100 years later in 2010. What did increase in direct proportion, though, are the consumption of sugar and the rate of obesity of both adults and children.This cautionary tale of sugar is not new. Late British physiologist and nutritionist Dr. John Yudkin warned in his work Pure, White and Deadly (Sweet and Dangerous in the U.S.), published in 1972, of the perils of the overconsumption of sugar. Dr. Yudkin, from his research, stated that sugar led to coronary thrombosis and dental caries. He hinted that sugar was probably the cause of obesity and Type 2 diabetes and possibly gout and some cancers.This was an instance of dueling nutritionists. Ancel Keyes, the ""Father of the Lipid Theory,"" disagreed with Yudkin. Keyes asserted that it was fat, not sugar, that was the culprit in modern diseases, particularly heart disease.Keyes yelled the loudest. Invectives of quackery, shoddy research and pseudoscience were hurled at Yudkin. He endured ad hominem attacks. In short, he was thoroughly discredited. We as Americans embarked on our low-fat, high-carbohydrate adventure.Yet the science was always there. Nobel prize winner Otto Warburg, in 1923, discovered the metabolic pathway of cancer cells to be one of anaerobic respiration -- glucose fermentation. Thus, even then, sugar was implicated in the growth of cancer tumors.Furthermore, there are essential fatty acids and essential amino acids for the human body. There are no essential carbohydrates, no essential sugars. We simply don't need them.The shift in public health policy, as demonstrated by the recommendations of the DGAC and the NYC board of health, not only vindicates Mayor Michael Bloomberg, but Dr. John Yudkin as well.Some years ago the Corn Refiners Association attempted to change public opinion by changing the name of high fructose corn syrup to corn sugar. It does not appear to have been successful. Of course it's all just sugar -- high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, honey, maple syrup, agave syrup and fruit juice. They are all metabolized the same way.  Dr. Robert Lustig of the University of California Medical School, San Francisco details that metabolism.How to allay confusion then? To begin, we need only pose a simple question: Is it good for human beings? Not, is it good for corporations, nor the sugar lobby, not even the dairy industry. Is it good for the human organism and the planet? That would be a start. Then we could just follow the money."

Stop downloading lip-syncing apps and listen to the new song right here:EARLIER: Rihanna caught our attention on Wednesday night after posting what appeared to be artwork for her new single on Instagram and teasing a March 26 release date with the hashtags #R8 -- the moniker she has used to describe her much-anticipated eighth album -- and #BBHMM. That latter tag represents the title of Rihanna's new track, ""Bitch Better Have My Money,"" 10-second snippets of which are now available on Dubsmash, the smartphone app where users can upload videos of themselves lip-syncing.The new single, referred to on Dubsmash as ""BBHMM,"" presumably hails from her first album since 2012's ""Unapologetic."" Its release follows months of restlessness from the Rihanna Navy. Fans have been tracking a slew of tidbits regarding the singer's next album, initially hoping for a 2014 release. Even without the full song, rest assured that we can all shine bright like diamonds knowing it's on its way.#BBHMM corresponds to the Braille on the left side of the artwork Rihanna posted, which, according to Complex, translates to ""Bitch Better Have My Money"" -- also a 1991 album and song by rapper AMG. ""R8,"" if that is indeed the album's title, still has no target date, though many fans hoped the March 26 tease would result in its full release. Kanye West is its executive producer, while DJ Mustard, Ty Dolla $ign, Natalia Kills, Florence Welch and Ne-Yo have also been touted as collaborators. We'll update this post when the full song becomes available."
7,FIFTY,King Lear and the Silver Tsunami,"Brendan Hare, ContributorRetired attorney and author of From Working to Wisdom: The Adv...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/king-lear-and-the-silver-tsunma_b_6942922.html,One of the great pains of aging comes when you discover how much time you wasted being wrong. One of its greatest pleasures may follow this -- when you see there's still time to change.,2015-03-26,Low key side portrait of an old man with a white beard.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6725c2600003001830bc1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm no Shakespearean. Until recently, I'd only read King Lear once. This happened in college, in the late 1960s, very early one morning, hours before I was to submit an essay entitled -- if I recall correctly- - ""King Lear and the Tragedy of Time."" There I sat, hunched over The Collected Works, squinting at its endless microscopic print, staving off sleep with cigarettes, battering the keys of my wobbly Underwood. By dawn, I'd produced a few pages of what I suspect was nonsense, but which somehow sufficed for a passing mark. After that, I declared myself an economics major, quit smoking, graduated and ran off to law school.Then, for 40-odd years, I busied myself with family and career, and never gave the old King more than a passing thought. His story, I believed, had nothing to do with mine. If pressed, I might have said, Sure, I know that one: There's this 80-year-old guy, see, and he's senile, and one day his daughters abandon him, and so he wanders around the countryside for a bit, and then he dies.One of the great pains of aging comes when you discover how much time you wasted being wrong. One of its greatest pleasures may follow this -- when you see there's still time to change. Of course I was wrong about Lear. More than this, I was wrong about old age. And these mistakes were rooted in the same ugly prejudice: I'm ashamed to confess that, for much of my life, I was an incorrigible ageist.About two and a half years ago, freshly retired, having entered what I was defensively calling my ""early late sixties,"" I dug up a copy of Lear and gave it another go. I was surprised to find that, as the curtain lifts, the hero is not feeble, not already half-lost to senility. Rather, he is strong, blustering, full of passion and self-assurance. It's the cruelty he suffers that speeds his decline. Two of his daughters shut him from their homes and condescend to him remorselessly. They call him an old fool and a superannuated baby, and tell him the time has come for him to ""be rul'd and led"" by others. Lear experiences this as a trauma. He exclaims, ""grief hath craz'd my wits,"" and begins to doubt his sanity, wondering aloud, who ""can tell me who I am?"" Before long, he seems to adopt his daughters' view, calling himself ""wretched,"" nothing more than a ""poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.""Amid its spectacular poetry and profound truth, King Lear offers something more basic: a rough metaphor for how society often mistreats the elderly. As I write this, ten thousand Americans are retiring each day. None of them, one prays, will suffer the type of extravagant cruelty inflicted by Lear's daughters. The evils most commonly faced by seniors are subtler and more diffuse, but pernicious nonetheless.As I've previously written, ageism stands as one of the last widely acceptable social prejudices, and is rampant even among the otherwise conscientious. When you watch for it, you find it everywhere: entertainment, government, advertising, commerce. Have a look at the birthday cards on offer at your neighborhood pharmacy. They supply a catalogue of ugly stereotypes about the old. Scanning them, you'd think no one has anything to look forward to past fifty but a painful, pathetic, protracted shriveling of body and mind.Ageism is harmful because, like other forms of prejudice, it prevents people from being treated fairly. It affronts their humanity and attempts to diminish them, to disregard their character, to reduce the vast complexity of each person to a thing, a cheap, ready-made, less-than-human ""type."" As Lear illustrates, the consequences of such prejudice can prove devastating. It may ""craze the wits,"" and trick us into believing that we are, merely because of our age, wretched and despised. The study results I cited in my last article from Duke University's Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development, the Journals of Gerontology and the CDC bear repeating: researchers have correlated experiences of age discrimination with higher rates of physical and mental infirmity.My generation can proudly reflect on the many ways in which, together, we helped to shape youth culture, sex, music, politics and civil rights. Much of this owes to the extraordinary demographic coincidence of our births: there are, quite simply, a lot of us. And in our numbers there is great power and energy. The buzz phrases used to label our cohort reflect this: We came into the world in a ""baby boom""; we'll depart it in a ""silver tsunami."" Surely, it is our responsibility to harness our collective might once more, and to rally against ageism with the same fervor we exercised in our youth. Stamping out age discrimination would stand as a worthy final achievement -- one more generational contribution to what George Eliot called the ""growing good of the world.""And as we fight against ageism in society, we must also guard against it in ourselves. On this front, Lear is also instructive. It reminds us that old age need not be, as the King believes at the start of the drama, a long ""crawl toward death."" Instead, it can be an adventure, an opportunity to enlarge our empathy and wisdom. As Lear draws nearer to death, he grows larger in spirit. ""The great rage"" that marred his mature years recedes, and he turns ""brave"" and ""jovial,"" wishing only to ""live, and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies."" Lear is famously difficult, bleak, brutal and sad. In spite of this -- perhaps because of the tremendous intensity of language and character on display -- it is never depressing, never foreclosed to hope. Near the end of the play, another old man, the Duke of Gloucester, having been betrayed, assaulted, blinded and cast out, breaks down and wishes to die. His devoted son sees him wallowing on the ground and speaks a simple phrase, one I hope to never forget, no matter what circumstances old age might impose: snap out of it, he says, ""Thy life is a miracle."""

NEA president Lily Eskelsen García told reporters on a conference call Wednesday that the union and its 3 million members are considering candidate endorsements earlier than ever. The goal, García said, is making education a top issue in the election. ""It is not too early to be thinking about who the next president of the United States is going to be, even though it's one and a half years away,"" said García. ""We know that educators have to step up and have our voices heard in this 2016 presidential election."" In the past, García said, the NEA would send politicians questionnaires about their views on education after candidacies had been announced. This time, the union has already sent questionnaires to all viable candidates in both political parties, said Carrie Pugh, NEA political director. The union wants to determine potential candidates' stances on issues that include the role of standardized tests, ballooning costs for university education and the rising number of students who come from low-income families. The NEA also has begun hiring organizers in states with early voting, including Iowa and New Hampshire, and is putting up billboards in Des Moines and Manchester.""You can read a poll, and a poll will tell you teachers are trusted and Americans want strong public schools,"" said García. ""A lot of people running for high office are not professional educators. We want them to know what we know are the right answers.""NEA leaders wouldn't say how much the union plans to spend on the election. During the 2014 midterm elections, the NEA and smaller American Federation of Teachers spent unprecedented sums. The AFT also has begun engaging members on who to endorse in the 2016 campaign, a spokesperson told The Huffington Post, though it's no earlier than in past presidential races. "

That seems to be the way it goes nowadays. A crazy rise to stardom, a seemingly never-ending series of stunts and stories to make them bigger, better, badder, crazier, more slutty, more sassy, more careless... an exhausting life led for all the world to see and mock that inevitably only ends because they die or can no longer keep up with the next big thing.As we parents watch this exhausting and terrifying cycle, we struggle to find a way to have a serious conversation with our children. They may not be international superstars, but the challenges they face are not so different -- cyber-bullying, peer pressure, depression, drugs, alcohol and sex.We agonize for hours over how to teach them to reach for their dreams but know their limits. How respecting themselves means making hard decisions and sometimes (maybe oftentimes) going against the greater will of the masses. We want them to learn that success cannot and should not come at the expense of your life or your sanity. You know us. We're the same moms and dads that sit grumpily through your concerts. We're the ones buying the concert tickets, T-shirts and iTunes downloads. You don't know, but we secretly sing along with One Direction songs when our kids aren't in the car. Our kids know you and love you, and we sorta kinda (but don't tell anyone) do too. So while there are certainly hoards of screaming tween and teenagers out there, sobbing your name and begging for you to return, please know that we're still here, a silent wall of support for you standing right behind them. We applaud you for choosing life over fame. We celebrate and hope that you will find the peace you seek. Most of all, we thank you. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for showing our children that there is more to life than fame and fortune. You've given us a positive opportunity to remind them that no amount of money in the bank can replace a life lost and that the most important expectations are the ones we set for ourselves.(This post originally ran on The Nomad Mom Diary and BLUNTmoms)"

However, this knowledge hasn't stopped us from pursuing more possessions, so new research is here to offer an antidote: If you want to be rich, you're also going to have to be grateful.A new study out of Baylor University found that the negative effects of materialism -- prioritizing the acquirement of possessions -- may be offset with a little thankfulness. Researchers sent a questionnaire to nearly 250 college students and found that those who link happiness with material gain were less satisfied with their lives, but practicing gratitude seemed to buffer those emotions. The results also suggest that the good nature of gratitude helps reduce the self-indulgent nature of materialism.""Individuals high in gratitude showed less of a relationship between materialism and negative affect,"" the study authors wrote. ""Additionally, individuals high in materialism showed decreased life satisfaction when either gratitude or positive affect was low.""We like to think this is a general score for the gratitude lovers, since the results found that people who express thankfulness felt happier with their lives. Gratitude has also been shown to help individuals sleep better, boost psychological well-being and improve your relationships.We know money can't buy us happiness, but apparently with a little gratitude, it can buy us a tad more life satisfaction.The findings were published in The Journal of Positive Psychology."
11,RELIGION,10 Tips for Creating Inclusive Religious Organizations,"Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, ContributorPresident, RespectAbilityUSA.org",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-tips-for-creating-inclusive-religious-organizations_b_6943718.html,"We are a stronger country when religious organizations of all faiths live up to our values--when we are welcoming, diverse, moral, and respect one another.",2015-03-26,Entrance to st. Mary?s Cathedral. Sydney. Australia,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fdcc2100002501c91eb2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We are a stronger country when religious organizations of all faiths live up to our values -- when we are welcoming, diverse, moral, and respect one another. People with disabilities and our families have the same hopes and dreams as everyone else, even if they face different challenges. However, as we approach major religious holidays and the eve of the 25th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it's important to remember that faith-based organizations were exempted from the ADA. Thus, many churches, synagogues, mosques and other religious organizations are not yet fully inclusive of people with disabilities. This is a big challenge as fully one in five Americans (56 million Americans) has a disability. Thus, by ensuring that those who want to be a part of the community are welcomed, respected and valued, we can be a stronger and better nation. Together we can build more inclusive faith-based communities where our children, parents, grandparents, and other family and friends with disabilities have an equal opportunity to fully participate. Here are 10 tips to do just that:1. Communicate that all people are of equal value and are to be respected and openly welcomed. Clergy and CEOs of religious organizations, lay leaders, philanthropists, and faith-based media all set the vision, mission and tone of faith-based communities. Leadership must be intentional, not accidental. Inclusion of all must be embedded in policies, budget, staffing and practice. 2. Work with people with disabilities, not for them. People with disabilities want a seat at the table and to be involved in decision-making. If there are no people with disabilities participating in your decision-making process, invite them in. Value their experiences and opinions. Even people who are unable to speak have opinions that must be shared and heard. Remember the mantra: Nothing about us without us. And keep in mind that people with disabilities don't want to be objects of pity -- they want to contribute to making this world a better place, just like anyone else.  3. Take the time to learn ""people-first language,"" which respects human beings and their rights to be appreciated for the strengths they have, rather than to be defined by their disabilities. An example of people-first language is referring to a child with Down syndrome by his or her name, not ""the kid with Down syndrome."" Or, worse yet, the ""Down-syndrome kid."" A person who uses a wheelchair is a person first. Their wheelchair is a tool of liberation, and he or she is not ""wheelchair-bound."" People-first language puts the focus back on people by speaking of ""people with disabilities"" (PwDs), not ""handicapped"" or ""the disabled."" It costs nothing to use different language and it goes a long way to making people feel respected and valued.4. Ensure all program registration and sign-up forms include questions about accommodations people may need to fully participate. Not all programs can meet every need, but often all we need to do is ask. Starting such conversations lets people know you care about including them. When participants indicate they need an accommodation (i.e. sign language, more time to transition from one activity to another, extra tutoring etc.) their forms must go to the inclusion director/coordinator so he or she can ensure that their needs can be met. If you have a question about what a person with a disability needs in order to participate in a program, the solution is easy: ask them!5. Trust is vital -- and must be established before even meeting face to face with a person with a disability. How can you do this? Go beyond encouraging people to share their needs on registration forms. When people share their needs, respect their privacy by treating it just as you would healthcare information. Also, those working with children with disabilities will find that parents can be your best assets: they are already experts in meeting their children's needs and can help you serve them successfully.6. Spread the word in your marketing and social media that all people - with and without disabilities -- are welcomed and appreciated. Showcase photos of people with disabilities enjoying your programs next to their ""typically developing"" peers. This sends a message that all are welcomed and valued. Websites, Facebook, Twitter and media can be important tools for sharing your values and what you offer. Post your diversity policy on your website and ensure it states that you are open to all, regardless of ability. Work to make your website easy to navigate and accessible to people who are blind and deaf. Post all of your videos on YouTube, which helps people who are hearing-impaired by creating free captions. 7. Inclusion is a lot less expensive than most people think, but it still takes the right team and training to do it effectively. All religious organizations, schools, camps and other institutions should have trained staff or provide effective training for existing staff in order to achieve success. Also critical is making changes to buildings so they accommodate those with disabilities. Professional training sessions and materials are vital to prepare staff and community for successful inclusion, and much of it is available online and for free.8. Provide an inclusion director/coordinator to ensure your organization is ready to meet the needs of community members with disabilities. This does not need to be expensive. Trained professionals can be hired on a part-time basis and many people are willing to work as volunteers. Numerous special educators, therapists and social workers working in public schools or other institutions may be available to work, consult or volunteer part-time. 9. Make a commitment to enable people with and without disabilities to develop peer relationships, build social skills and respect and accept each other. In many institutions, one-on-one counselors and educators who provide support to children with more involved disabilities may mistakenly think their job is to be a child's best friend. It's not. Their role should be to ""aid and fade"" so that children with disabilities can make friends with their typically developing peers, and children without disabilities can enjoy diverse friendships as well. Moreover, it's not a staff member or counselor's job to fix every problem or constantly hover over participants. Instead, they should help children or adults with disabilities discover solutions on their own. At times a teacher or counselor will need to assist people with disabilities, either physically or in a conversation to meet their needs. But once the immediate need is met, it is important that people are given the space to be as independent as possible.  10. Put diverse and qualified people with and without disabilities on your staff, board and committees. Non-profit and for profit agencies alike should reflect the people they serve. This includes being models for involving qualified people with disabilities. In addition to developing programs with people with disabilities, they should also employ them and make use of their great talents. Organizations can encourage their members to offer internships to young people with disabilities or serve as 'job coaches' to help teens with disabilities get on track to a life of independence and success.We all have hopes, dreams, and a desire to contribute to making a better world. By being intentional about opening our doors to all people no matter their differences, everyone benefits. Each person with a disability, just like those without disabilities, has strengths, purpose, equal value and a place in the community."

We have all learned something about one of our kid's friends or one of our friend's kids that we are not sure what to do with. We may have learned that our daughter's perfectly lovely friend is smoking marijuana several times per week, or that your son's best friend has confided (and not to his parents) that he is struggling with depression. These are among the trickiest of all situations, particularly if you have learned this information from your child. Here, you find yourself between a rock and a very hard place. On the one hand, you don't necessarily want to go directly to the child's parents and betray your child's confidence, but you don't necessarily want to ignore the information either.What's a parent to do?Listen to me carefully here, and please feel free to write to me and chime in. I've seen these types of situations go terribly awry and go extremely well. There are a number of pointers to keep in mind before choosing action or inaction.1. Consider that your child may feel in over his or her head and may be confiding in you with the hope that you will intervene. If you sense that this is the case, call the child's parent and let him know what is going on.  2. Before calling a parent, ask yourself if you are coming from a place of good intention. Look at yourself in the proverbial mirror and ask yourself if you truly care or if you are simply sharing gossip. 3. If you do call a parent, let him/her know that you will keep this information between the two of you and that you have no intention of making this community information-gossip that is.4. Before calling another teen's parent, let your child know. Your child may be a little upset, but at least she will not be blindsided.5. You may want to ask the parent not to reveal the source of information to their child. Theinformation is more important than the source and may protect your relationship with your child.  6. If your teen is up to it, give her the opportunity to encourage the friend to talk to her parents herself. This is not the likeliest outcome, but it's worth a try.7. Think about whether or not you would want this information shared if it was your child. If the answer is an unequivocal yes, then by all means pick up the phone.8. If you believe that there is an abusive situation going on, you may want to call the school. School personnel are mandated reporters of abuse.  9. Know that you may lose some friends in this process, because we are all very sensitive about our kids, right? Better though to lose a friend then to kick yourself for holding on too tightly to information that would help the child by being shared.AND  10. Listen closely to your heart and gut and pray for the best. We are after all a community."

I mean that figuratively, and man that opening line, which is still going on by the way, was pretty lame. Yet, it's true. The Broadway veteran and television actress has been a force for years -- from her recent turn as Jory in the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway drama Disgraced to her recurring role on the FX series The Americans. A-Sides caught up with Pittman, and talked about her credits in film, stage, and the tube. Before I get to the interview, take a look at her credits. Maybe I'll lie and take some and throw them on my resume. I'd seem so much cooler. Anyway, Pittman has appeared on television shows such as The Blacklist, 30 Rock, and The Good Wife. She starred in Broadway's Passing Strange, and was seen various films including The Bourne Legacy and Begin Again. Anyway, let's get to that interview...The Americans is one of the most awesome (yet underrated) shows on TV. Talk to me about your character, and whether or not you were a fan of the show beforehand. Feel free to say you were even if you weren't.I certainly knew about The Americans, because the characters and the idea for the story was so original. I'm not a big TV watcher, but [this] was the exception during their first season. I was (also) excited to find they had a character that I might help create with them. My character Lisa befriends Michelle at an Al-Anon meeting and starts out as a mentor, but really, they become friends, taking care of each other. So they look out for each other in many ways and you'll see their relationship unfold over the season. I really like Lisa because of her love of her children, she likes to laugh, she's devoted to family, hard working. I like that both Michelle and Lisa are vulnerable with each other and it proves to conjure up some real moments with Keri (Russell) on screen. She's a real pro and a lotta fun to work with.Yes, and she had great hair in Felicity and no one should bring that up anymore so I apologize. Anyway, you have so many Broadway and television credits, what's the biggest challenge of both mediums.... what's a cake walk? The challenge of working in both mediums is staying spontaneous, interested especially after long days on set, or several weeks during the run of a play. I was fortunate that my character on The Americans is the polar opposite in many ways to the character I was working on in the Broadway play Disgraced so I was able to keep my imagination active. The easy part is that the writing, the aesthetic, the cast and crew really make the experience what it is. I find I do my best work when I feel comfortable...You appeared in Begin Again and The Bourne Legacy. Would a mash-up of the films work? What might that look like? [Laughs] A mash up would definitely work! I'd love to do one of those famous Tony Gilroy scenes where the camera follows you through a crazy stunt scene car chase situation...I had a great time on Begin Again. It was a lot of fun.Getting back to Broadway, do you have any immediate plans to return? I do not...Our last show for Disgraced was just a few days ago (although we joke that there should be a sequel called The Jory's In), I'd like to take a little break from the stage and continue working with my film and TV projects for a bit. But, Broadway is an incredible experience as an actor, a test of stamina and focus. I'll always be happy to come back to climb that mountain. Always.Lastly, do you remember your first opening night on Broadway? Talk me through it. I consider my first real Broadway opening night to be Disgraced - it was a glittery, starlit evening, filled with well wishers and congratulatory hugs. I remember seeing my co-stars looking smashing and the playwright on pins and needles. It all turned out beautifully. And the splashy third season premiere of The Americans this year was cancelled because of ""Sno-mageddon"" (aaaaargh!!). I'm certainly rooting for my character Lisa to stick around til next season, so I can get to the next glittery opening for Season 4!

Christine Burke describes how her daughter's simple question made her see herself through a 7-year-old's eyes and examine why she spent so much time and effort contouring, highlighting, plucking, cleansing and otherwise enhancing her looks.I wear makeup. Not every day, but then, I work from home, so half the time I don't put on my clothes, let alone my face. But if I'm going out and I have time, I'll do my makeup. And I love buying the stuff... few things make me happier than finding a new brightly-colored liquid eyeliner!But what message am I sending my kids? Am I teaching Molly that women need to correct or enhance their natural features? That her own face isn't good enough? That to live as a woman means to constantly be evaluated against society's standards of beauty and modesty, skirt *juusst* long and short enough to demonstrate that you're neither a slut nor a prude; ""bare-faced"" makeup that makes you look exactly like you aren't wearing makeup without looking like you do when you aren't wearing makeup...Spoiler Alert: Unfortunately, that last one *is* true.And what about our boys? Am I teaching Ben to idealize a particular set of beauty standards and to expect a certain level of effort from the girls and women in his life? That he should judge them by the amount of pride they take in their appearance, as evidenced by the time they spend curating it?Intersectional or ""third-wave"" feminism seeks to dismantle ALL of the systemic oppressions that impact ALL people. As A. Lynn of Nerdy Feminist puts it, ""When you enter a feminist space and you are only concerned about sexism, you are missing the full story."" Read the rest of her fantastic post, ""Intersectionalism 101,"" here. Go on. I'll wait.When it comes to our society's standards of women's beauty (which are influenced by a multitude of factors, including sexism, racism, whiteness, tokenism, ablism, transphobia, fatphobia, homophobia, rape culture, slut-shaming and which are marketed through mass-media and passed down through generations) there is only so much we can do on a micro level to influence our kids one way or the other.But we can do that much.We can expose those arbitrary standards for what they are -- arbitrary standards. We can celebrate all kinds of beauty and focus on characteristics other than ""beauty."" And we can frame discussions about our bodies, hair and faces in terms of our own choices and desires rather than how other people see us.Many of the responses I've seen to Christine Burke's post refer to ""needing"" makeup -- things like ""I wear it so I don't spend the whole day listening to people tell me I look so tired,"" and, ""I tell my daughter she probably won't need it until she's older.""But that's what it does for other people -- what does makeup do for you? For most people, it makes us feel happy about how we look. It makes me happy to have a pop of colur on my eyelids and or to disguise a zit on my forehead. Maybe it makes you happy to have a more even complexion, red lips or darker lashes. There is nothing wrong and everything right about choosing to wear something that makes you happy.In the post I referenced earlier, author Christine Burke relates her reply to her daughter's question: ""'I look into her clear, freckled face and simply say, ""I wear makeup because it tells the story of my face in color.' And I hope my answer enough for now and I pray that she can't see the lie through my makeup.""Her words make me want to smile and weep at the same time, because her response is playful and alive and naturally flawless. I just wish she had believed it herself.When Molly asks me, ""Why are you putting that stuff on?"" I say, ""Because I like to."" When she says, ""What's that blue thing for?"" I say, ""To make my eyelids blue."" When she says, ""Can I have blue eyelids?"" I say, ""Sure. Hold still!""Because what I want my children learn from me is not that ""true"" beauty is natural and youthful and free from artificial enhancements until you're old enough to need them. I want them to learn that true beauty is enjoying and loving yourself the just way you are -- makeup and all.~ karynThis post originally appeared at PicklesINK.

It happens when you pass a roadside sign and see ""Men in Fleas"" or ""Mean Trees"" instead of ""Men in Trees."" Happens to me all the time, typically when anxiety (or too much caffeine) gets the best of me.My most recent case of ET, however, has caused me to really think about the way I've been living. You see, a couple of years ago, I wrote for a fashion and beauty website dedicated to women on a budget. While working on an article, I did a double take when I read about a particular skirt style. It said it had ""abbreviated living."" Huh? A living skirt?In reality it was, ""abbreviated lining,"" a style whereby the lining ends above the hemline. The rest just hangs looking empty, needing more.Hmmm. Abbreviated lining, er, living.So I got to thinking: are we living abbreviated lives? Like the skirt, are our abbreviated lives leaving us with the feeling that something is missing? Are we cutting ourselves short of our full potential, sacrificing a bit here and a bit there . . . dare I say, skirting the issue?I know I am, and I doubt I'm alone.I thought this two years ago, and interestingly, still find myself struggling with these questions today.Social Media: Are we making our character count?Even our social media mandates we live abbreviated lives. We think our character counts when, well, we make the right character count on Twitter.Our interactions with family and friends are often social media-dependent. If grandma and mom aren't privy to a party or event, oh well. We'll tell them about it a week later. Our Instagram and Facebook friends see pictures of an event before family even knows there was one in the first place. Sometimes, relationships fall by the wayside, ironically, thanks to certain sites that aim to bring them together. After all, why meet when you can ""see"" how I've been doing on the internet? Wouldn't talking about it over lunch be a waste of time?Sigh.Now, I'll be the first to admit I'm a bit of a Facebook addict. I'm on Twitter, Skype, LinkedIn and dabble with Instagram. And StumbleUpon. And Digg. And Pinterest. Oh Boy. Clearly the importance of social media and the power it has to spread news, inspire, grow business and form friendships is a wonderful thing. But lately, I've been feeling like it's been one too many status updates and not enough dinner dates for me.Am I the only one?In a way, we're secretly more thrilled at a retweet, a Facebook ""like"" or text from a pal than a phone call with a relative we haven't spoken to in ages.Facebook: modern-day equivalent to asking little Susie to come out and play?Yet we continue: We send out new friend requests on Facebook, the modern-day equivalent to a third-grader showing up at the house down the street, knocking on the door to ask if Susie can come out and play. Like the child, we sit and perhaps stew, wondering why Susie doesn't like us anymore or why little Joe never accepted our friend request. But we get over it 11 seconds later, moving on to share with our ""real"" friends pictures of our teff and walnut breakfast, as I did earlier today. Bet you're sorry you missed that, huh, Susie?Will obits read, ""born in #Wisconsin, John was a longtime member of the #VFW with 433 Facebook friends who once tweeted '#ILoveHamburgers because I don't like cheeseburgers,' and who had a Facebook page consisting of 14,237 likes""?I think not.We'll remember him (hopefully) for community involvement, his smile, his love of the Twilight Zone and his passion for saving endangered species.Editing pictures or our lives?We want to be involved, but are we? Really? Does the quick ""like"" of something take the place of actual involvement in it? Is our retweet of someone's call for action enough of an action? I sometimes share images of missing children, mistreated animals and inspirational sayings about certain illnesses, but should I be doing more? Is a good heart filled with good intentions enough? Still, I take pics, upload dozens of pics to various albums, crop the pics, put filters on the pics, manage the pics, caption the pics, tag people in the pics, edit the pics, delete a few pics . . . could it be that at times, I'm more consumed with posting life's moments than I am actually living them? Indeed, our gadgets fill us with the notion that we're saving time and bonding with family and friends more. I kinda think it's less. I don't know about you, but the time it takes me to check out Facebook, manage my pages, see the latest Twitter trends, share stuff, text people about what I read on Facebook, check personal emails, pay bills online and scour news headlines (and . . . inhale), leaves me little time to get my oil changed, let alone make a phone call to a good friend.I came upon a quote recently that sums up a great deal of our abbreviated living: ""The more elaborate our means of communication, the less we communicate.""  - Joseph Priestley (No, not Jason Priestley, for all of you who just had a case of Eye Trickery and some ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" flashbacks. This particular one was an 18th century theologian, philosopher and scientist.)As I write this, looking out of my window at the New Hampshire landscape, I catch the sunlight enveloping birch trees. It's a pleasant day, and I understand temperatures may reach the low 50s later in the week. I'm tempted by the warmth, excited at the thought of leaving earmuffs inside. Hmmm.I'm all of 15 minutes from mountains and lakes. My deadlines are met. Just like that, I could get in my car and take in the sweeping views and fresh air. But someone just commented on something I posted, and well, it'll still be nice out later.Maybe.  This article originally appeared on Jennifer Lilley's site, Jen Lilley's Thought Buffet, in 2013.

Schneider, who wrote about law enforcement in her book, ""Art of Darkness: Ingenious Performances by Undercover Operatives, Con Men, and Others.""",2015-03-25,2015-03-24-1427202084-2178000-SaraSchneiderCourtesyofMitchellSchneider.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-24-1427202084-2178000-SaraSchneiderCourtesyofMitchellSchneider-thumb.jpg," This is an interview with Sara K. Schneider, who wrote about law enforcement in her book, ""Art of Darkness: Ingenious Performances by Undercover Operatives, Con Men, and Others."" Yet she describes having had since her early 20s a ""haunting"" to work inside the prison system. Initially finding it hard to ""break in,"" she started teaching men in a post-release program on the west side of Chicago. A mindfulness teacher who'd been teaching in the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) made introductions for her to teach the female minority residing in the federal prison in Chicago's central Loop. Sara directed the MCC's women's yoga program, where she taught weekly from 2012 to 2014; and has recruited and trained other yoga teachers to teach both women and men inside the prison. In addition to being a yoga instructor, Sara is a playwright, professor, and performance ethnographer writing about body-based spiritual practices including, most recently, yoga in prisons. Sara can be reached at sks@thinkingdr.com.Rob: What have been some of the surprises of teaching yoga in the prison setting?When I started working with the women at the MCC, I imagined I'd be introducing yoga to women who had not had any prior experience with it. Not only did these women incarcerated in Chicago's federal prison seem more comfortable and familiar with seeing yoga as a spiritual as well as a physical practice than sometimes do new students ""on the outside,"" but a few had already been practicing yoga before their incarceration. Many of the women who self-selected to join the yoga class were using their prison time in other ways to develop themselves spiritually.Another surprise was how the conventions of the yoga studio seemed to fall away. Some of those who were newer to yoga frequently saw the poses in a sexual light, and would break out into nervous laughter or giddy riffs on the poses that would take the group a while to recover from! I had to learn to go with the flow on that, to allow the laughter as a necessary part of coming to the practice from prison culture. It was important to channel that laughter so that it would be shared rather than aimed at one or another student, as might be common on the residential floor. How else did you have to adjust your expectations or adapt your teaching in the prison setting?I'm a vinyasa teacher who loves flowing and (yes) complex sequences. The inmate population is not necessarily invested in yoga choreography, nor is the average inmate in physical shape to be able to get much flow going, in part because prison life keeps the women quite inactive. While at the beginning I held to an idea of getting my new students into shape to be able to handle vinyasa, the MCC population was so transient that this wasn't a realistic goal.Over time, my teaching shifted to focus on a couple of things: the first was giving the inmates a few simple breathing, mindfulness, and postural practices they could do on their own, in the spaces available to them, to enhance their ability to handle anxiety, depression, anger, and other troubling emotions they naturally experienced during the week. The second focus was trying to give the women an experience of positive female community. Sometimes my regular students wouldn't come down to the chapel space for yoga because of infighting with other women on the floor they knew were planning to come; they just didn't want to do yoga side by side with them. With only 20 or fewer female inmates in a facility of nearly 700, every woman got to know every other woman very well. In class, one of their favorite activities was to lay out the yoga mats right up against each other and to ""roll."" It was actually a very gentle twist that would take all of us, in a very childlike way, from one side of the open chapel room to the other. We'd start face down, and initiate rolls onto our backs from the trailing hip and rolls onto our bellies from the trailing shoulder. The women loved teaching new students how to roll in this way and laughed and laughed together as they flopped onto their backs or onto their bellies. My sense was that it was rare for these women to enjoy the simple pleasure of their bodies in this communal way in their life on the residential floor. Plus we were doing fun spinal twists!Finally, I wanted them to have the protected space of a class and to have a Savasana (corpse pose) that offered a brief but complete release. These women are woken up with guards' flashlights shone in their eyes early each morning, and had so little experience of real rest. They instantly understood Savasana as a space of deep, protected peace, yet it was often real work to ensure that no prison staffer interrupted them, as they did not necessarily buy into the vital importance of such rest.Are there ways in which your teaching in a prison has impacted your teaching on the outside, or your own practice?The fact of incarceration, as juxtaposed with the freedom inherent in yoga, was brought home powerfully to me on a summer's evening when we had class on the roof of the prison, instead of in the chapel, which actually has a glorious view of the Chicago skyline. As we started our sun salutations, and I modeled raising my eyes to my joined hands overhead, in our line of vision was the barbed wire roof that stood between us and the sky of Chicago. I remember my unfettered ability to see the sky every time I do a sun salutation now. When I teach in studios, I'm aware of our privilege in being able to buy classes, to feel comfortable in a yoga studio, and to end class at our leisure, rather than with a sharp interruption from a guard. I appreciate that many of us are wearing clothing that supports rather than impedes movement. And I am more aware than before of the power of yoga as a practice for those who know they need one.What would you describe as a peak moment in your teaching of the inmates?I think probably my favorite moment was when one of the students, a sometimes-bawdy and always-enthusiastic participant, was stretching in wide-legged forward fold (Prasarita Padottanasana A), experimenting with whether it was possible to deepen into a pose simply by ""breathing into it."" Like me, she was from the era of bouncing and re-bounding to deepen a stretch, and we were investigating a whole new way of taking the practice inside. As I watched her, it seemed evident to me that this smartly clowning, often externally oriented woman had found a new and internal reference for her pose. She bobbed up as if from a deep-sea dive, and cried, ""I breathed into the pose!"" We had big smiles all around.What advice would you share with those hoping to teach in a correctional setting?Teaching in a prison means that you will be subjected and exposed to some part of the trauma of incarceration that inmates experience daily, such as the withholding of information about what is really going on, the lack of control over your time, and the inability to move without supervision. There are also inexplicable barriers to effective communication across departmental lines, the all-too-close scrutiny of how you are dressed and surveillance of what you can carry into the prison, and a culture in which staff members can seem more bent on passing blame than on serving the public.  Ensure that you have a way to process some of the emotions that come up, ideally with others teaching in a similar setting. Here in Chicago, the Socially Engaged Yoga Network, a loose collective of yoga teachers involved in social justice work, has been having quarterly gatherings to network and to share experiences and lessons learned. The sense of community with others involved in yoga service work has been invaluable!

A Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus police officer was shot and killed late Thursday night at the school's campus in Cambridge. A short time later, police reported exchanging gunfire with alleged carjackers in Watertown, a city near Cambridge. One suspect has been killed during the car chase and police are seeking another, believed to be the same person (known as Suspect Two) wanted in connection with the deadly bombing at the Boston Marathon earlier this week. Police have confirmed that the dead assailant is Suspect One from the recently released marathon bombing photographs.

FBI leadership ""is not unified or consistent in driving cultural change"" needed to move away from its traditional approach of prosecuting crime and towards the goal of stopping threats in a complex environment, the report said.On a more positive note, the commission found the bureau has improved information-sharing with other local, state and federal law enforcement organizations. Collaboration with the CIA is also at likely the highest level ever.One big impediment to the bureau's work has been the difficulty it faces forming ""constructive partnerships"" with tech companies and the public due to skepticism about the government programs unmasked by Edward Snowden, the report noted. It called the FBI's engagement with the private sector ""fragmented."" To help, the report recommended that the bureau work with Congress on legislation that would somehow enable tech companies to better communicate and work with the government in combating cyber threats.The report's commissioners were Ed Meese, who served as attorney general under President Ronald Reagan; Tim Roemer, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana; and Bruce Hoffman, a Georgetown professor with an expertise on terrorism.

Bratton and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio were talking about Shotspotter, a new technology that the NYPD is using to detect gunfire throughout New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ef082100002501c96cfa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York City police Commissioner William Bratton has a message for privacy advocates concerned over the NYPD’s new ShotSpotter program: “Get a life.” Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the launch of ShotSpotter last week. The $1.5 million program, which has been implemented in other cities, consists of a series of publicly mounted microphones intended to capture the sounds of gunfire and send data to police in real time about where the shooting is happening.At a press conference announcing the launch, de Blasio said that the technology “increases the chances of catching the shooter. It increases the chances of recovering the weapon. It increases the chances of stopping further crime.”But it can also, on occasion, increase the chances of authorities listening in on people’s conversations. Conversations recorded by ShotSpotter have been used to convict people in murder trials in Oakland, California, and New Bedford, Connecticut, raising concerns among civil liberties advocates. Pressed about those concerns earlier this week by Rita Cosby on her Sunday WABC show, Bratton said “the advocates have to get a life.” “We’re not out there eavesdropping,” he said. “That’s not what the system does. That’s not what it’s designed to do. That’s not what it’s capable of. So get a life. Move on to some other issue. We’re not out there eavesdropping on public conversations. I got enough to do without doing that.” Still, privacy advocates could be forgiven for being wary of the NYPD. In recent years, the department has spied on Muslim communities and protesters, stopped and frisked hundreds of thousands of people illegally and maintained a camera surveillance program called the Domain Awareness System, which watches over much of Manhattan. The New York Civil Liberties Union has not made any public comment about ShotSpotter. A spokesperson told The Huffington Post Wednesday that the organization is still studying the technology.Previously, Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, told the digital media company Take Part that “we are always concerned about secondary uses of technology that is sold to us for some unobjectionable purpose and is then used for other purposes.” “If [ShotSpotter] is recording voices out in public, it needs to be shut down,” he said. In 2013, according to an investigation by WNYC, 75 percent of “gunshots” detected by the ShotSpotter system in Newark, New Jersey, turned out to be false alarms.ShotSpotter -- a private, California-based company on whose board Bratton sat before he was sworn in as New York's police commissioner in 2014 -- says on its website that its microphones “do not have the ability to overhear normal speech or conversations on public streets,” and that the technology does not permit police to listen to any sort of live audio. “Unless someone is yelling loudly enough to be heard in public, and also doing so within two seconds before or four seconds after a loud, explosive acoustic incident, the audio will be flushed from the sensor’s buffer and overwritten,” the site says. “The simple fact is that there has never been a case of a private conversation overheard or monitored by any ShotSpotter sensor anywhere at any time. Period.""Bratton has said Shotspotter is important because in other cities, 75 percent of shootings go unreported.There are currently 300 ShotSpotter sensors in place in New York, primarily in Brooklyn and the Bronx, that are able to detect 15 square miles of the city. New York City public advocate Letitia James has introduced a bill that would require the NYPD to issue quarterly reports on the data collected by ShotSpotter.  "

20,RELIGION,Why George Zimmerman's Theology Is Flawed,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-zimmerman-gods-plan_n_6938456.html,,2015-03-25,"FILE - In this Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2013, file photo, George Zimmerman, acquitted in the high-profile killing of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, listens in court, in Sanford, Fla., during his hearing on charges including aggravated assault stemming from a fight with his girlfriend. Zimmerman is asking a judge to change the terms of his bond so he can have contact with his girlfriend. Zimmerman on Monday, Dec. 9, 2013, filed an affidavit from his girlfriend that says she doesnât want him charged with aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief. (AP Photo/Orlando Sentinel, Joe Burbank, Pool, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fdb52100000001c91ea4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"George Zimmerman, the man who shot and killed Trayvon Martin in 2012, thinks it was God’s will that the 17-year-old died -- but many Christians reject this opinion.In a video released on Monday by the law firm Ayo and Iken, which represents Zimmerman, the 31-year-old said he has a clear conscience and does not believe things could have turned out differently that day in Sanford, Florida.“I believe God has his plans, and for me to second-guess them would be hypocritical, almost blasphemous,” he said in the video.Though steeped in religious rhetoric, Zimmerman’s analysis does not sit well with many Christians who reject the notion that God wanted Martin to die. “It’s a theology that’s different than mine,” Rev. John Vaughn, the executive vice president of Auburn Theological Seminary, told The Huffington Post over the phone. “My theology is one of much more that's rooted in God’s love and that we have free choice and will.”Pastor Victor Montalvo, who leads a congregation in Sanford just blocks away from where the teenager was shot, told HuffPost he believes Zimmerman should assume responsibility for his actions and repent.“The idea that God willed for him to shoot Trayvon is absolutely ludicrous,” Montalvo said. “It’s not God’s fault that Trayvon is dead.”Montalvo said that for weeks after the shooting, he drove by memorials on the side of the road. His church is diverse, with no racial or ethnic group comprising more than 35 percent of the congregation, he said. “As a multiethnic church, it’s easy for us to take for granted our multiethnicity and our celebration of diversity,” the pastor said.Montalvo said the shooting brought to the forefront “seething” racial tensions that have existed in Sanford for generations. But, he added, it also has provided Christians with an opportunity to “stand in humility” and work to restore their communities. And this is where Zimmerman’s statement on Monday breaks down for the pastor.“God can use even the worst situations,” he said. “But when you talk about the will of God, you talk about the desire of God,"" and it's not right to say that God would want this death.“That God somehow wanted Trayvon to be shot and killed ... We don’t see that in Jesus,” Montalvo said.Vaughn brought up one of the most-repeated phrases in the holy text: ""Be not afraid."" He said the ""stand your ground"" law in Florida -- which allows a person to use deadly force in self-defense when faced with a perceived threat -- is based on the presumption of guilt before innocence and encourages people to act out of fear, just as Zimmerman did that fateful day. As a father of two young African-American boys, Vaughn said he is worried about the precedent the Zimmerman case sets. “The fact that this could be one of my sons walking down the street who’s assumed to be guilty before proven innocent greatly concerns me,” he said.The reverend said he is optimistic that faith communities will continue working toward greater equality and safety for all people -- but the theology at the heart of this work needs to be one of love.“The church has done some poor things and the church has done some incredible things,” he said. “It’s important that people of faith and moral commitment continue to step up, continue to push for change, continue to be building bridges with police communities, with law enforcement, with a range of leaders and reaching out to communities like the community Mr. Zimmerman might represent to create more substantive relationships and dialogue to do something to change the tide.”"

One who is afraid of votes in a ballot box will eventually see stones thrown in the streets,"" Rivlin said.Netanyahu, accepting the mandate that gives him six weeks to form a new coalition, said he sought peace with the Palestinians and pledged his new government would safeguard democratic rights for Israelis ""regardless of race, religion or gender,"" as well as taking steps to cut living costs.Two far-right parties - Jewish Home, which won eight seats, and Yisrael Beitenu, with six - have pledged their support for Netanyahu in consultations with Rivlin.In addition, centrist Kulanu, with 10 seats, ultra-Orthodox Shas, with seven, and United Torah Judaism, with six, have also backed Netanyahu, whose Likud has 30 legislators of its own.Although the horse trading for cabinet positions has yet to start, Likud announced that Netanyahu will name Kulanu's leader, Moshe Kahlon, as the next finance minister, replacing the centrist Yair Lapid, who has refused to join the new government.Kahlon, a former Likud member, focused his newly-founded party's campaign on promises to reform the housing and banking sectors and bring down real estate prices, which have doubled since 2007.A Likud team is due to begin bargaining sessions with its prospective coalition partners on Thursday, but the government-building process will compete for headlines in Israel with the worst crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations in decades.OBAMA ANGERNetanyahu's pre-election promise that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch and his comments about Arab voters further aggravated his testy relationship with U.S. President Barack Obama, who has dismissed his subsequent attempts to backtrack.Obama was already furious after Netanyahu accepted an invitation from the Republicans to address Congress earlier this month, where the Israeli leader attacked a potential nuclear deal between world powers and his arch foe Iran.The Democrat president has since said that Washington would ""reassess"" its relations with Israel, which receives some $3 billion a year in military aid from the United States.One of Kahlon's first tasks will be to pass a budget for 2015 and 2016, as the country has been operating since the start of the year without a new financial program.Shas and United Torah Judaism are expected to pursue a narrow agenda to benefit their own largely poor religious sector, leaving Likud and the ultra-nationalists as the main players on hot-button matters such as Iran's nuclear program and peace with the Palestinians.Tzachi Hanegbi of Likud, deputy foreign minister in the outgoing government, predicted a slow path to a coalition, with far-right partners likely to lobby for top cabinet posts, such as defense and foreign affairs.""It will take time. It will demand nerves of steel from all sides, particularly from the prime minister,"" he told Israel Radio. (Additional reporting by Tova Cohen; Editing by Crispian Balmer/Ruth Pitchford)"

But the justices ducked a ruling on the plan's lawfulness and sent the case back to a lower court.The court avoided deciding whether the redistricting plan proposed by the Republican-controlled state legislature in 2012 violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law by concentrating black voters, who tend to vote Democratic, into a small number of districts.The court was divided on ideological lines, with conservative swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy joining its four liberals in the majority.The case centers on the practice known as gerrymandering in which election districts are drawn in a way to provide one party an advantage in as many districts as possible while consolidating the other party's voters into as few as possible.Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the majority, said the lower court should have considered the claims district-by-district rather than focusing on the state as a whole.""Asking the wrong question may well have led to the wrong answer,"" Breyer wrote.Breyer made reference to ""the harms that underlie a racial gerrymandering claim.""""Those harms are personal,"" Breyer wrote. "" ... They directly threaten a voter who lives in the district attacked.""The redistricting plan in Alabama, a Deep South state with a past history of erecting hurdles for black voters, was challenged by the Alabama Democratic Conference and the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus.This was the first voting rights case heard by the high court since its 2013 ruling that gutted a key section of the Voting Rights Act.Conservatives Antonin Scalia, John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.Scalia said the ruling undermines states' ability to manage their own elections and would have ""profound implications for the constitutional ideal of one person, one vote."" Scalia objected to the challengers getting ""a second bite at the apple"" under the ruling to attack the state redistricting plan.Thomas, the court's only black justice, criticized state legislators who take race into account, saying, ""This is nothing more than a fight over the 'best' racial quota.""The two consolidated cases are Alabama Democratic Conference v. Alabama and Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-1138 and 13.895. (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"

(Photo by Erhan Elaldi/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fdb91f00002501252e4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ayla Jean YackleyEDIRNE, Turkey, March 25 (Reuters) - When the domes of Edirne's abandoned Great Synagogue caved in, Rifat Mitrani, the town's last Jew, knew it spelled the end of nearly two millennia of Jewish heritage in this Turkish town.As a boy, Mitrani studied Hebrew in the synagogue's gardens and, in the 1970s, dispatched its Torah to Istanbul after the community shrank to just three families. In 1975, he unlocked its doors and swept away the cobwebs to marry his wife Sara.""Only I am left. It happens slowly, becoming the last one,"" said Mitrani, 65,whose family fled here more than 500 years ago.Now a five-year, $2.5 million government project has restored the synagogue's lead-clad domes and resplendent interior ahead of its Thursday re-opening, the first temple to open in Turkey in two generations, but one without worshippers.It is part of a relaxation of curbs on religious minorities ushered in during President Tayyip Erdogan's 12 years in power.Yet it coincides with a spike in anti-Semitism in predominantly Muslim Turkey and a wave of Jews moving away, say members of the aging community, which has shrunk by more than a third in the last quarter century.The increase, observers say, is linked to anti-Israel sentiment which reached a crescendo during Israel's Gaza offensive in July. Erdogan compared Israel's assault on Palestinians to ""genocide"" and ""Hitler's barbarism.""He drew distinctions between Israel and Turkish Jews, yet his words helped stoke outrage, and local Jews were threatened by public figures and pro-government newspapers.Turkey's Jews, most of whose ancestors sought refugee here from the Spanish Inquisition, are on edge. Their school and synagogues are behind security tunnels, shielded by steel blast protection.""They have lived in a state of fear for a long time after terror attacks and the feeling that they are not treated as Turkish citizens. There is worry for the younger generation,"" said Ohad Kaynar, Israel's deputy consul general.Louis Fishman, an expert on Turkish affairs at Brooklyn College in New York, saw evidence of government indifference to anti-Semitism. ""Buildings might be protected but the people who visit them are subjected to regular hate speech and threats,"" he said.Erdogan's spokesmen and other officials did not respond to requests for comment for this article. However, the Turkish government has been at pains to distinguish between its Israel policy and its attitude towards Turkey's Jewish population. FORMER FRIENDSClose allies under previous governments, Israeli-Turkish ties hit a nadir in 2010 when Israeli commandoes stormed a Turkish-led convoy of ships carrying aid to Gaza and killed 10 Turks. Turkey withdrew its ambassador and ejected Israel's.""Regardless of the fact that we identify ourselves as Turks, we are still perceived as foreigners. Tensions between Turkey and Israel directly impact us,"" said Karel Valansi, a political columnist with Salom newspaper.For centuries, Ottoman lands were a haven for Jews, welcoming Sephardim expelled in 1492 by Spain.Once here, they adopted new rituals, such as the melody of the azan in their prayers, while maintaining their traditions, most prominently the Judeo-Spanish dialect called Ladino.Census data shows Ladino was the mother tongue for 84 percent of Turkish Jews in 1927 before nationalist campaigns stamped it out. Today only a few elderly speak the archaic form of Castilian Spanish, one of the world's endangered tongues.A ""wealth tax"" in the 1940s, emigration to Israel after 1947 and decades of political instability conspired to decimate a population that was 150,000 before World War One.Spain and Portugal are redressing historical wrongs by offering citizenship, bound to prompt some to pull up stakes.""Jews have long left for economic reasons. What is different now is a factor for young people is the pressure they feel because they're Jewish,"" said Mois Gabay, 31, who writes for Salom. He cited figures showing one in four Jewish high-school graduates opted to study overseas in 2014, doubling in one year.But the decline is mainly due to a death rate that exceeds births threefold, said Naim Guleryuz, the Jewish museum curator. HATRED FLARESAt Istanbul's main Neve Salom synagogue, vandals in November hung a fake demolition notice close to the anniversary of a string of 2003 car bombings claimed by al Qaeda that targeted Jewish temples and British interests, killing 57 people.Even the opening of the Edirne synagogue was at risk. The governor said it would be a museum instead and that he felt ""hatred"" after Israeli police entered al Aqsa mosque in November. He later apologized, and restoration work continued.""This is not only Jewish but a part of Turkish and world heritage. It is proof that we have lived together and still do,"" said Guleryuz, author of a book on Edirne's Jews. ""If we occasionally celebrate a wedding, we can keep it alive.""The synagogue's bright yellow exterior is a burst of light among the dilapidated wooden houses and concrete apartment blocks in Edirne's former Jewish quarter. Inside, painters painstakingly decorated the ceiling with thousands of stars, as beams of sunlight passed through a colonnade of neat arches.""It looks like its old self,"" said Mitrani, standing beside the polished marble of the ark bearing the Ten Commandments.Once the Balkans' largest Jewish temple, the Great Synagogue opened on the sultan's decree in 1909 to serve some 20,000 Jews. It was modeled on a temple in Vienna, later destroyed by the Nazis.Thousands of Jews left Edirne, situated near the Greek and Bulgarian borders, in 1934 when a racist mob attacked their property, but Mitrani's father, a grocer, rebuilt his shop.Mitrani, who owns two supermarkets here, travels to Istanbul each week to join his wife and daughters for the Sabbath.He planted a pine tree next to his mother's grave in the old cemetery, part of which has been occupied by a housing complex that uprooted graves. Litter is strewn among hundreds of broken headstones, which include the odd Greek Orthodox inscription.""I would have liked to have been buried in Edirne, next to my mother,"" Mitrani said. ""Staying was always the easiest thing for me. I can't imagine the day I won't be here."" (Editing by Nick Tattersall and Janet McBride)"
26,POLITICS,Supreme Court Sides With Pregnant Workers,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-ups-pregnancy_n_6939004.html,,2015-03-25,"People wait in line outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Monday, March 23, 2015, in hopes to gain admittance for oral arguments. (AP Photo/Molly Riley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ef182100004202c96cfe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In a victory for pregnant women in the workplace, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in favor of a worker who sued shipping giant UPS for pregnancy discrimination, sending her lawsuit back to a lower court where she had previously lost.The case, Young v. United Parcel Service, hinged on whether or not UPS was justified in putting Peggy Young on unpaid leave after she became pregnant, even though other workers were commonly offered ""light duty"" for on-the-job injuries or to satisfy requirements under the American with Disabilities Act. The justices ruled 6-3 in favor of keeping Young's lawsuit alive, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joining the traditionally liberal members of the court.Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the majority, said the question the lower court needed to ask was ""why, when the employer accommodated so many, could it not accommodate pregnant women as well?""The decision essentially vacates a 2013 ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that threw out Young's case.Samuel Bagenstos, a lawyer for Young, called the ruling a ""big win"" in a tweet shortly after the decision came out.""The Court recognized that a ruling for UPS would thwart Congress’s intent. It adopted most of our key arguments,"" Bagenstos said, in an apparent reference to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The 1978 law says that companies cannot treat pregnant workers any differently from other workers who are ""similar in their ability or inability to work."" @jamieson It’s a big win. The Court recognized that a ruling for UPS would thwart Congress’s intent. It adopted most of our key arguments.The question at the heart of the case was whether the Pregnancy Discrimination Act requires companies to offer light-duty options to pregnant workers if they already do so for non-pregnant workers in other situations. UPS had maintained that its light-duty rules were ""pregnancy neutral,"" treating a pregnant worker like Young the same as anyone else. Under its collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters, UPS said it didn't have to accommodate workers with ""off-the-job injuries or conditions,"" except for cognitive disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act.The company tried to claim a partial victory after Tuesday's decision, saying in a statement that the Supreme Court ""rejected the argument that UPS's pregnancy-neutral policy was inherently discriminatory."" UPS said it was ""confident"" it would prevail in the lower courts, where Young's case may now go to trial.Whatever the outcome of Young's lawsuit, the Supreme Court case has reflected poorly on UPS. Young sued the company in 2008 and lost her case without a trial. That decision was upheld by the 4th Circuit in 2013, leading Young to appeal to the Supreme Court. Last year, not long before oral arguments were set to begin, UPS announced that it was changing its accommodation policy for pregnant workers, after years of defending it in court. As of Jan. 1, 2015, pregnant UPS workers are entitled to light duty.Young, who was interviewed by The Huffington Post in October, was delivering packages for UPS in Maryland when she became pregnant in 2006. Her doctor recommended she not lift more than 20 pounds for the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy. Although light duty was common for many workers, UPS told Young that such accommodations wouldn't apply to an ""off-the-job"" condition, which is how it classified her pregnancy.""I wanted to work,"" Young told HuffPost. ""I all but begged for them to let me work.""Young received support for her lawsuit from across the ideological spectrum, with 23 anti-abortion groups lining up behind her alongside the American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce. As the anti-abortion coalition noted in its brief, ""economic pressure is a significant factor in many women’s decision to choose abortion over childbirth."" "

The uptick in positive evaluations of the environment is offset by a decline in those rating the environment as 'only fair.' Forty percent of Americans rate the environment as only fair, down from 44% in 2014 and the lowest percentage found since 2001. At the same time, the 9% rating the quality of the environment as 'poor' is similar to what Gallup has found over the past six years. Americans' ratings of the quality of the environment dropped in 2003 and didn't rise until 2010… All partisan groups are a bit more positive about the quality of the environment this year than they were in 2014... Unlike the improvement seen in Americans' ratings of the environment today, the percentage who say the quality of the environment is 'getting better' has been essentially unchanged since 2009… Americans during Obama's presidency have been more likely to say the quality of the environment is getting better than they were to say the same during George H.W. Bush's presidency… Republicans are slightly more likely than independents or Democrats to say the environment is getting better."" [Gallup]Specific worries decline - Jeffrey M. Jones: ""Americans' concern about several major environmental threats has eased after increasing last year... Americans express greater concern over more proximate threats -- including pollution of drinking water, as well as pollution of rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and air pollution -- than they do about longer-term threats such as global warming, the loss of rain forests, and plant and animal extinction… The amount Americans worry about the various threats tends to rise and recede in unison, with concern higher in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the revival of environmentalism, and in the late 1990s and early 2000s amid the economic boom. Since then, Americans' worry has fallen, with concern dipping to record lows on most issues in 2010 or 2011. The current level of worry on each issue remains at or near those record lows… Americans tend to give environmental concerns higher priority when the economy is healthy than when it is ailing…The primary focus of the environmental movement has shifted toward long-term threats like global warming -- issues about which Americans tend to worry less than about more immediate threats like pollution.… And although concern about environmental issues is lower among both Republicans and Democrats since 2000, it is down more among Republicans.""
