We are heading toward a potentially severe clash between environmentalists who advocate for reducing carbon emissions and community and labor activists who are most concerned about jobs, racial equity, and reducing wealth inequality.Our urgency about the climate catastrophe does not trump equity concerns.Both the climate crisis and the wealth gap are deepening -- and both will require aggressive social movements. We can either pull together to work toward a systematic ""just transition"" -- a transition, that is, that satisfies both groups -- or we can be pitted against each other by corporate interests.I spent the summer interviewing labor, environmental and community justice activists and thinkers about the rift for a longer in-depth article on this topic in The American Prospect. Many of them invoked the late labor leader Tony Mazzocchi--described by biographer Les Leopold as ""the Rachel Carson of the American workplace.""Mazzocchi believed that, for the environmental movement to succeed, it must advocate for a ""just transition"" for workers displaced by environmental protections. That transition would offer benefits far beyond the pitiful job retraining programs included in trade agreements like NAFTA.Happily this concept of a just transition has been embraced and further developed by many in the climate justice movement. The Climate Justice Alliance has pointed to places like Richmond, Calif., home of Chevron refineries, the coalfields of Kentucky, and the Black Mesa reservation in Arizona, as having been exploited by the fossil fuel industry. They are pressing for just transition policies at the community and national level.""Fear keeps U.S. working people from looking to the future.""The question of a just transition extends beyond U.S. borders, and is further along across the Atlantic. In England, the debate over growth is more part of the political discourse and Labor Party Leader Ed Milliband was spotted reading Tim Jackson's Prosperity Without Growth. In France, a ""degrowth movement"" has pressed lawmakers to pursue a ""power down"" agenda -- in other words, policies that reduce our society's thirst for energy, such as incentives for improved insulation.In Germany, the labor movement is a full partner in the transition to decentralized and renewable energy, especially in the country's post-Fukishima rejection of nuclear power. This is in part because workers in Germany already have a strong social safety net. So if they lose their jobs during the transition away from fossil fuels, they will not lose their income, homes, or basic security.As Joe Uehlein, co-founder of the Labor Network for Sustainability, has said, ""Fear keeps U.S. working people from looking to the future.""Those of us in the climate justice movement have to appreciate that our urgency about this catastrophe does not trump equity concerns. If we really want to fix the environment, then we need to join coalitions with organizations that focus on changing our economic system too.The environmental movement must become a new economy movement that advocates for full employment, a just transition for workers, and job-boosting public investment in education, infrastructure, and research."
1,RELIGION,Pope: 'God Is Not Afraid Of New Things',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-homosexuality-church-gay_n_6010904.html,,2014-10-19,"Pope Francis waves as he leaves after he celebrated the beatification ceremony of Pope Paul VI, and a mass for the closing of of a two-week synod on family issues, in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican, Sunday, Oct. 19, 2014. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f18d200000f90101883d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - Pope Francis has closed an assembly of Catholic bishops that revealed deep divisions on how to respond to homosexuality and divorce, saying on Sunday the Church should not be afraid of change and new challenges.Francis, who has said he wants a more merciful and less rigid Church, made his comments in a sermon to some 70,000 people in St. Peter's Square for the ceremonial closing of a two-week assembly, known as a synod.The working session of the gathering ended on Saturday night with a final document that reversed a historic acceptance of gays by the Church made just a week earlier -- a result some progressives see as a setback for Francis.  ""God is not afraid of new things. That is why he is continuously surprising us, opening our hearts and guiding us in unexpected ways,"" the pope said.At the Mass, he beatified Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, bringing the pontiff best known for concluding the ground-breaking reforms of the Second Vatican Council and enshrining the Church's ban on contraception a step closer to sainthood.After an initial draft of the synod's final document was released on Monday, conservative bishops vowed to row back on the upbeat tone adopted regarding gays, cohabitation and re-marriage, saying it would create confusion among the faithful and threatened to undermine the traditional family.Francis dedicated most of his sermon to the synod, which tackled themes such as homosexuality, divorce, re-marriage, and same-sex couples ahead of a definitive gathering next October after more discussions at a local level around the world.He said the Church had ""to respond courageously to whatever new challenges come our way"". He spoke about courage a day after telling the bishops at their last working session to beware both ""hostile rigidity"" by doctrinal conservatives as well as ""destructive good will"" by those seeking change at any cost.BOTCHED ARTICLESFrancis called the synod, where some 200 bishops had heated debates on issues of sexual morality, ""a great experience"" because participants were able to speak ""in true freedom and humble creativity"".Now, he said, ""the Church is called to waste no time in seeking to bind up open wounds and to rekindle hope in so many people who have lost hope"".The pope, who urged the bishops to speak their minds frankly at the start of the meeting, told them on Saturday night that he would have been ""worried and saddened"" if there had not been such honest discussion during the gathering.Voting tallies released by the Vatican showed that three controversial articles, including the final version of one concerning gays, won an absolute majority but failed to get the two-thirds vote needed for a broad consensus.But the pope decided to keep even the botched articles, which would have been deleted under normal synod rules, in the final document, meaning the themes will be discussed locally ahead of next year's assembly.Experts pointed to the long-term results of Francis' new style for such assemblies, which in the past did not take place in two stages and did not allow for wider debate at the local level among the faithful.""By changing the synod methodology and making sure the assembly’s candid, sometimes contentious discussion was heard around the world, the pope showed he was not afraid of real debate,"" said John Thavis, author of the bestselling 2013 book ""The Vatican Diaries"".""Pope Francis clearly placed the Church on a new path, toward an evangelizing style that is less focused on doctrine and more willing to invite people in, no matter what their status,"" Thavis wrote in his blog.Former Pope Benedict XVI attended Sunday's Mass, making only his fourth public appearance at a major Church event since his resignation in March, 2013.(Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Crispian Balmer)ALSO ON THE HUFFINGTON POST  LISTEN: What Is The Future For LGBT Catholics "

Finland last week accused the Russian navy of interfering with a Finnish environmental research vessel in international waters.The Swedish military has said information about suspicious activity came from a trustworthy source, without providing details, and that more than 200 military personnel were involved in the search.The Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, citing unidentified sources with knowledge of the hunt, said it began after a radio transmission in Russian on an emergency frequency.Further encrypted radio traffic from a point in the archipelago and the enclave of Kaliningrad, home to the Russian Baltic fleet's headquarters, was intercepted on Friday evening after the Swedish search started, the newspaper said.The Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that there were no emergency situations in the Baltic involving its vessels.""Russian Navy ships and submarines are fulfilling their duties in the world ocean waters in accordance with the plan,"" Interfax news agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying. ""There has been and there are no extraordinary, let alone emergency, situations involving Russian warships.""Countries in the Baltic Sea region have become increasingly wary of Russia's military ambitions since Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March following the overthrow of Kiev's pro-Moscow president by protesters.Last month, Sweden said two Russian warplanes entered its air space, calling the intrusion a ""serious violation"" and sending a protest to Moscow's ambassador in the Nordic country.Ships, helicopters and troops from an amphibious unit as well as the home guard combed the search area in Stockholm's archipelago. The forces include HMS Visby, a corvette that has stealth technology and equipment for anti-submarine warfare.The Swedish military said on Friday there had been no armed intervention and declined to comment on who might be responsible for the suspicious activity, or whether the report had been about a submarine.""We still consider the information we received as very trustworthy,"" Captain Jonas Wikstrom, head of operations for the search, told reporters. ""I, as head of operations, have therefore decided to increased the number of units in the area.""Should the search find proof of foreign military activity in Swedish coastal waters it will represent the first real test of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's center-left minority government only weeks after coming to office.In 1981, a Soviet submarine known under its Swedish designation U137 was stranded deep inside Swedish waters not far from a major naval base in the neutral country, sparking intense suspicion about the scale and motives of such incursions.

Nigeria's government is ruling out an exchange of more than 270 kidnapped schoolgirls for detained Islamic militants, Britain's top official for Africa said Wednesday. Boko Haram abducted more than 300 schoolgirls from the school in Chibok in the northeastern state of Borno on April 15. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13f2c240000330022983e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LONDON -- Finally, a ray of hope for the more than 270 Chibok girls whose abduction by Boko Haram on April 14 has led to six months of captivity -- six months during which the girls' parents did not even know whether their daughters were dead or alive.The announcement on Friday of a potential cease-fire with Boko Haram and the strong rumor that the girls will be released on Monday is a vindication of the work of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and campaigners globally, who have never allowed the girls to simply vanish from the public eye.On Saturday, the day after an announcement of a cease-fire, there were Boko Haram inspired attacks on two Nigerian villages. And, as I am writing this, the latest ​information is that ""some"" of the girls may be released but perhaps not all of them. We cannot rest satisfied until every girl is returned to her family.Then there will be the work of healing.When the military options for rescue became difficult because the girls were split up and the release of one group would imperil others, the government did not give up. Amid constant rumors of exchange deals that would see the girls returned for Boko Haram prisoners seized by the Nigerian government, the government refused to do anything that would boost further terrorist incursions into Nigeria and her neighbors. Nigeria recognized that while Boko Haram had wreaked havoc, it reportedly had only around 1,000 terrorist fighters spread across Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad, and it could one day be forced into concessions.NO RETURN TO THE WAY THINGS WEREBut the schools of Nigeria cannot return to the way things were. Business as usual will not work. They have been changed forever by this outrage. For months, Boko Haram has managed to instill so much fear and anxiety amongst the schoolgirl population of northern Nigeria that thousands of girls no longer go to school.Now, thanks to the president and Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, there is a plan that brings hope for a better future for all girls who want to go to school. The plan might even tackle some of the problems that have allowed Boko Haram to cause so much trouble in the first place. The international task force assembled at the behest of President Jonathan and chaired by Ngozi is gathering significant donor support for the Safe Schools Initiative. It is now ready to bring forward its proposals to fund better fortifications -- from fences to guards and better telecommunication links between schools and the armed forces -- that will help to allay fears of children that they may be abducted from what should be the safe haven of a classroom.So far $25 million has been raised for this vital initiative, but a great deal more needs to be done. The Safe Schools Initiative was boosted with the news that 15 of the 57 girls who originally escaped from their kidnappers were going back to school and were even prepared to brave Boko Haram's threats to return to abduct them again. These courageous girls are trying to make up for lost time in their studies. Some are at schools in others states, but soon if the Safe Schools Initiative works, many will be prepared to take up the help of Norway, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States for their own state.Soon our focus will be the 10 million girls and boys who do not even enjoy elementary education in Nigeria, and we will make a plan to get them all to school as soon as we can. The Nigerian initiative to support girls in particular is part of a global civil rights struggle to end child trafficking, child labor, child marriage and discrimination against girls. Support for Nigerian girls is at the heart of the efforts of hundreds of Global Youth Ambassadors, who descended on New York last month from 100 countries to demand the right for an education for all be met. Hadiza Bala Usman of the Bring Back Our Girls movement joined in with hundreds of other youth campaigners and other grassroots advocates from around the world. The crowd demanded that people across the world stand ""Up For School"" and launched a global petition that carries the hopes of young people everywhere. It is intended to be the biggest petition in history and was launched under the title #UpForSchool, aiming to increase the awareness of world leaders of the millions of girls and boys shut out from education. With the possibility that the Chibok girls will go free soon, we must intensify our efforts for the wider global goal that every girl has the chance to be at school, safe and free from violence.A previous version of this piece referenced the daughter of a local carpenter. New information has confirmed the girl was not in fact from the Chibok community. "

(AP Photo/Simon & Schuster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb483572400005100979be5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rob Lowe, 25 years sober, sat in the Champagne Room at the famed Palladium Theater in Hollywood, California on Friday night, dressed in all black but sans tie. The 50-year-old actor was all ready for prom.There with his wife, Sheryl Berkoff, Lowe was on hand to support comedian Seth Rogen’s third annual Hilarity for Charity event. This year, the theme was '80s prom, which suited Lowe just fine: He never even went to his own prom, forgoing that seminal rite of passage for 1983’s cult favorite, “The Outsiders.” “I’m going to try to make up for lost time by making out with my wife in the backseat of a car tonight,” he said to HuffPost Entertainment, looking over at Berkoff, who was seated nearby.Lowe has long been involved in raising awareness for health issues, specifically cancer. He has worked tirelessly with Stand Up To Cancer and was the first male spokesperson for breast cancer awareness, having lost his mother and grandmother to the disease.Now, he's working with Genworth to encourage families to start having conversations about long-term health preparation for diseases like Alzheimer’s. He likens it to having the adult version of the birds-and-the-bees talk, and says it can be uncomfortable.“It’s a tacit acknowledgment of aging and mortality. And we don’t want to talk about it,"" Lowe said. ""We don’t want to think of our parents in that light and we certainly don’t want to think of ourselves in that light.”Lowe has been married to Berkoff since 1991, and they have two adult sons who are both in college -- but he is still getting used to that statement. One is at Duke and one is at Stanford and Lowe actually shudders at the word ""adult"" when discussing his children. “It’s such a depressing phrase,” he said with a laugh. “I prefer rambunctious. But I can’t really call them kids anymore, can I?”In fact, most of Lowe’s die-hard fans have loved him since he was practically a kid himself. After starring in many films during the 1980s and 1990s -- he was one of the original members of the Brat Pack -- Lowe transitioned to long-running television series like “The West Wing” and “Parks and Recreation."" He is perhaps one of the best people you could talk to about the definition of success. But the meaning of that word has undoubtedly changed throughout the decades of Lowe's career. Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise and Emilio Estevez at a film premiere in 1982.“When I was filming ‘The Outsiders,’ my idea of success was getting the next Martin Scorsese movie,” he said. “In fact, when Tom Cruise did get the next Martin Scorsese movie ['The Color of Money'], I was very angry. And then to add insult to injury, it was starring fucking Paul Newman. So I wanted to kill myself.”But over time, the value he places on success has morphed quite drastically. Now, at age 50, Lowe calls upon a new interpretation. “Living well is the best revenge,” he says. “It’s more about how I can live my life with the people I love. And if work doesn’t fit around my lifestyle, I’m not interested.”Part of that lifestyle is living close to the ocean in Montecito, California and surfing whenever he can. Surfing is such an integral part of his life that in 2011 Annie Leibovitz shot him on the cover of Vanity Fair, shirtless with nothing but his board. She also shot a photograph of his two sons for the magazine, and he has it signed and framed at home above his desk. It’s also the screensaver on his phone.Recently, Lowe has taken to stand-up paddleboarding. “Maybe it’s because I’m a Pisces. But whether it’s surfing or just being in the water, I find the ocean unbelievably recharging,” he said.He has an animated show in the works at Comedy Central with Elizabeth Banks called “Moonbeam City,” and a recently announced NBC comedy where he plays a character described as a “newly sober narcissist father.”“Really what I’m playing is the Dos Equis 'Most Interesting Man In The World' -- without the Dos Equis,” he said.But the better phrase for his character, according to Lowe, is a ""benevolent narcissist."" It's a term coined by his former “Parks and Recreation” co-star Rashida Jones.“I’m taking it as a compliment,” he explained of the nickname. Besides, as Lowe relayed, Jones thinks all the best people are narcissists, including even her father, Quincy Jones. In an attempt to define the term, Lowe used Quincy Jones as his example. “He lives a huge, talked about, endlessly interesting, larger-than-life life. Charismatic. Walks into a room and lights it up with energy. Hilarious. Interesting. And likes to be the center of the action,” he said. Comedies that are about the lives of the people making them are most exciting to Lowe. ""Like driving the car today, 'The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald' comes on the radio. I’m singing along. I loved it. My wife hates it, she wants me to turn it off. We fight about 'The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,'"" Lowe said. ""That is an episode of this show."""

(AP Photo/Wally Santana)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13f2b2400005500e47bf2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By James Pomfret and Elzio BarretoHONG KONG, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Violent clashes erupted early on Sunday in a Hong Kong protest hotspot as unarmed pro-democracy activists once again confronted riot police despite the confirmation of talks between protest leaders and officials early this week.Hong Kong's 28,000 strong police force have been struggling to contain a youth-led movement that has shown little sign of waning after three weeks of standoffs in which hundreds of thousands of people have occupied city streets to demand full democracy in the former British colony.In the densely populated Mong Kok district, police managed to earlier repel protesters from a major intersection but have faced a significant pushback.In the early hours of Sunday, demonstrators launched a fresh midnight assault, suddenly putting on helmets and goggles to ready themselves, before surging forward to grab a line of metal barricades hemming them into a section of road.Amid screams and cursing, hundreds of officers began whacking the protesters who raised a wall of umbrellas. Pepper spray was used intermittently amid violent scuffles. The police then surged forward with riot shields, forcing protesters back.""Black Police! Black Police!"" the crowds shouted amid the fray. One protester in a white T-shirt and goggles was beaten by a flurry of batons leaving him bleeding from a gash in the head. Several protesters were taken away. Fire trucks with water cannons were stationed further down the street but weren't used.A senior policeman on the scene, Paul Renouf, said 400 to 500 officers were deployed to force the crowds around 20 meters back from their original position near a key intersection.Hong Kong's Security Chief Lai Tung-kwok said some of the clashes in recent days had been initiated by activists affiliated to ""radical organizations which have been active in conspiring, planning and charging violent acts.""The fresh street battles come just hours after Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leader Leung Chun-ying offered talks to student leaders next Tuesday in an attempt to defuse the three-week long protests that have grabbed global headlines with scenes of clashes and tear gas rising between waterfront skyscrapers.Leung's chief secretary, Carrie Lam, announced on Saturday that talks between student leaders and the city government would take place for two hours on Tuesday and be broadcast live.The protests have been going on for three weeks and pose one of the biggest challenges for China since the crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing in 1989. It is also the gravest governance crisis faced by Hong Kong's government since the 1997 handover to China, with no clear resolution in sight.""These illegal acts are undermining the rule of law, undermining (what) Hong Kong has been relying on to succeed,"" said Police Commissioner Andy Tsang. He added his force had been ""extremely tolerant"" but had failed to prevent the demonstrations becoming more ""radical or violent.""Chinese and Hong Kong leaders are refusing to give in to any protesters' demands, while the movement has so far been galvanized, rather than cowed, by the use of police force.The protesters, led by a restive generation of students, have been demanding China's Communist Party rulers live up to constitutional promises to grant full democracy to the former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Hong Kong is ruled under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that allows the thriving capitalist hub wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms and specifies universal suffrage for Hong Kong as an eventual goal.But Beijing ruled on Aug. 31 it would screen candidates who want to run for the city's chief executive in 2017, which democracy activists said rendered the universal suffrage concept meaningless. The protesters are demanding free elections for their leader. 'WE WILL STAY'The Mong Kok area known for its tough, working class social fabric and criminal underbelly, has been the scene of violent brawls in recent weeks, pitting students against hostile mobs including triads, or local gangsters. While the heart of the protest zone was cleared away in the early hours of Friday, protesters regrouped to take back key sections within 24 hours.Posters declaring ""Reclaim Mong Kok!"" had been plastered on shop fronts.""We'll keep coming back,"" said student Angel So, 20, as a friend, Terry Leung, nursed grazes on his arms and legs from scuffles with police.Besides Mong Kok, about 1,000 protesters remained camped out on Hong Kong Island in a sea of tents on an eight-lane highway beneath skyscrapers close to government headquarters.

Unfortunately, too much of it is shallow -- mostly a stringing together of clichés. More disturbing still, is the extent to which this crisis has provoked another round of uninformed conversation about Arabs and Islam fueling fear and hatred of Arab and Muslim Americans. While a few knowledgeable individuals have been invited for rare media appearances, all too often the networks have let laziness win out dragging out a cast of ""regulars"" -- former military officers, current or former elected officials, and paid ""talking heads"". They may know a few choice Arabic words (Sunni, Shia, Jihadi, etc.) and can use a few of them in a sentence. But experts, they are not. I'm sorry to sound elitist, but some guy who made a fortune in real estate and happened to be elected to Congress is not, in my book, qualified to speak about countries he's never visited or cultures he's never studied. To hear these ""experts"" pontificating about Islam or Arab culture is more than annoying. It's downright dangerous. Instead of elevating the discourse, they dumb it down. And instead of making us aware of the enormous complexities involved in these conflict zones, they reduce them to simple and easy clichés. America has been down this road before in the Middle East -- with tragic results. I fear we may be heading there once again. During the past four decades we've been deeply involved across this region, but because we've known so little about its peoples, cultures and history -- all too often our involvement has spelled disaster. Studies have shown that the U.S. educational system doesn't prepare us to understand the Middle East. Popular culture has distorted perceptions of the region and its peoples reducing them to crude one-dimensional negative stereotypes. And the political culture has, all too often, exploited these stereotypes -- elevating them to political truths. After 9/11, there was a flurry of commentary about Islam and the Arab World. Questions were asked ""why do they hate us?"" and ""what's wrong with the Arab World?"" We knew we had a problem and we wanted to understand its source and how to resolve it. I found it especially tragic that, in that moment, when so many were open to knowledge, major media outlets and political leadership failed miserably. Instead of informing, they fell back on the conventional wisdom of the stereotypes. The airwaves were dominated by commentators who were either purveyors of the same old myths or those who had an axe to grind against Arabs and Islam.The answers they provided to the above questions were ahistorical, tautological or just plain uninformed. To the first they responded -- ""they hate us because they hate our values and are envious of our success"" or ""they hate us because they have been taught to hate us"". And to the second --"" they have failed because their religion is fundamentally backward"" or ""they have failed because their culture is inherently flawed"". Instead of helping to create understanding, they reinforced stereotypes. And instead of shattering myths enabling us to see our way forward to bridging the chasm that separated the West from the Arab and Muslim peoples, they accented our fears and contributed to deepening the divide. Fear and sensationalism might have been a convenient way to boost ratings or an easy way to scare up votes -- but real damage was done. Our political leadership, with most media outlets cheering them on, committed hundreds of thousands of our young men and women to fight and lose their lives in two failed wars. The Bush Administration invaded both Afghanistan and Iraq without any real understanding of their history or people -- stumbling as one would upon entering a dark room -- not knowing where we were going, what we would find, what we were bumping into, and what the consequences of our blunders would be. Almost 10 years after 9/11 and seven years after the invasion and occupation of Iraq, Zogby International conducted a poll of American public opinion. What we found was frightening: 37 percent of Americans still couldn't find Iraq on a map; less than a quarter knew that Syria bordered Iraq; and two-thirds thought Iran was an Arab country. Almost half of all Americans believed that ""most Muslims are religious fanatics"", and almost three-quarters were convinced that ""Arabs hated our values"". As someone who has spent his entire adult life attempting to understand the Arab World and to build bridges between East and West and who has worked with my brother, John, to measure Arab and American public opinion, all this was so terribly frustrating. Our polling in the Arab World shows that the overwhelming majority of Arabs love American values and culture, people and products, and the advances Americans have made in science and technology. What they don't like about us are our policies which so negatively affect their lives. Far from being fanatics, Arabs tell us that what they value most are their families and their work. They watch TV to be entertained. And their mosque attendance rates are roughly the same as church attendance rates in the U.S. But that's not what comes through over our airwaves or in our political discourse. When President Obama traveled to Egypt in 2009 to speak to the Arab and Muslim Worlds, he was making an effort to change and elevate the discussion -- there and here. He began:We meet at a time of tension between the United States and Muslims around the world -- tensions rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate... tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations.He continued appealing to both sides not to let our relationships be defined by differences, to reject negative stereotypes, and to end ""the cycle of suspicion and discord."" I believe that the President's Cairo speech is as relevant today as it was then. What is unfolding in Syria and Iraq is clearly a danger that we must address. But before we go half-cocked into another Middle East war based on half-baked notions about the people we will be fighting, we need to know a great deal more about the challenges involved. We need to understand the nature of ISIS. What is its appeal; what are the social and political characteristics of its base; how is it seen by those whom it counts as supporters; and what accounts for its rapid spread? What will it take to defeat them and what exactly would victory look like? How are we perceived by allies and enemies, alike? And will that impact our ability to operate in the region?This may be a war worth waging. But before we do more, we need to know more. Given the level of understanding on display from too many political commentators, that's something they still don't get. Follow @AAIUSA for more."

And with the stakes sky high in the 2014 midterm elections, the dirty political pool by the GOP was totally predictable.",2014-10-18,"Representative Tim Murphy, a Republican from Pennsylvania, makes an opening statement as he chairs a House Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee hearing on the U.S. public health response to the Ebola outbreak in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2014. Hospitals in the U.S. caring for Ebola victims need to appoint a full-time individual who is responsible for overseeing infection control, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today.

The GOP blamed President Obama for it. First, it was the lame brained borderline racist charge that Obama either deliberately or through sheer incompetence did nothing to seal the borders to keep the virus at bay. The only slightly more intelligible attack was that Obama did nothing to command the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take panic measures to insure no incidence of the disease would turn up in the country. Then the GOP campaign strategists stepped in and had some of its top candidates suddenly parroting the kooky line that Obama was to blame for a supposedly porous and negligent CDC and border security lapse. Obama's appointment of an ""Ebola Czar"" provided even more grist for the GOP hit mill on Obama. It was variously blown off as too little, too late or ridiculed as a desperate appointment of a supposedly medically unqualified political crony.This is political gamesmanship of the lowest order, playing on media and public fears over a legitimate and terrifying health crisis, to again belittle Obama. And with the stakes sky high in the 2014 midterm elections, the dirty political pool by the GOP was totally predictable. But the twist in the Ebola saga is that the dirty hit job has backfired. The attack opened the GOP wide open to media and public scrutiny of the galling fact that the GOP has systematically whittled away vital funding for dozens of health programs since 2010. The CDC, much the whipping agency for the supposed Obama health dereliction, was stripped of nearly $600 million; millions that could have gone to ramp up monitoring, screening, and education programs, as well as research on vaccines to deal with infectious and communicable diseases. The names of the more than two dozen Republicans who poleaxed the CDC budget have been published. And to no surprise the bulk of them are either directly affiliated with or have been in part bankrolled by tea party factions. In September, there were initial reports that House Republicans would cut almost half of the nearly $100 million that the White House wanted earmarked to fight Ebola. It didn't happen not because of any sudden epiphany by the GOP House members to provide all the funding that the White House asked for the program, but because word had quickly leaked out about the defunding possibility, and that would have been a PR nightmare that even the most rabid anti-Obama House Republicans knew was fraught with deep peril. GOP leaders have hit back hard on the charge that they are somehow to blame for any laxity in the fight against Ebola by claiming that Obama and the Democrats have also made cuts in the NIH budget and that those cuts are the reason for any shortfall in the CDC's funding for programs. That's true as far as it goes. But what the GOP conveniently omits is that the cuts to the NIH budget and indeed all other health and education and domestic spending program cuts were agreed to by Obama with the GOP jamming a virtual political gun to his head demanding he sign off on cuts as the draconian price for ending gridlock over the deficit war. Now in the backdrop of a potential catastrophic health nightmare, the cuts have suddenly become as big a political campaign tug of war as the blame game about Ebola. But it's one that the GOP can't win. Because it, not Obama and the Democrats, have been firmly identified in the public eye as the ones that have consistently sledge hammered the Obama administration and Congress to cut, cut, and cut some more spending. No matter how much the right wing gnashes its teeth, shouts and moans and attempts to turn the table and finger-point Obama for the funding fall off in the Ebola fight, it won't change that naked reality. The hit ads that Democrats took out lambasting the GOP for the funding cuts are believable not because of any numbers accuracy or inaccuracy but in part because of public belief that when it comes to pound saving, the GOP will go to any length to save a dollar at the expense of vital programs. The ads are believable in greater part because the GOP has left no stone unturned in its ruthless and relentless drive to use any and every crisis real or manufactured to paint Obama as a weak, ineffectual and failed president and presidency. It has banked on, and stoked, the frozen political divide in the country knowing that a wide segment of the public has open, unabashed contempt for his policies and his administration. The GOP banks that it can swivel this divisiveness into sustained opposition to those policies, and that it can further boost its numbers in the House and especially the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections. The ultimate aim is to translate the incessant hit attacks on Obama into a White House win in 2016.The Ebola scare gave the GOP another seemingly readymade opportunity to blame Obama for yet another crisis. But this time the signs are good that the ploy has backfired.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.
