1,LATINO VOICES,Dozens Of High-Profile Hispanics Write Blistering Open Letter To Donald Trump,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/67-hispanics-write-blistering-open-letter-to-donald-trump_us_563caecde4b0411d307096fc,"Junot Díaz, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Diego Luna, Demián Bichir, Mario Vargas Llosa and 62 others came together to blast the candidate.",2015-11-06,"He Called Latino Immigrants ""Criminals"" And ""Rapists""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e0e21714000077002e4580.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Dozens of prominent Hispanic figures from across the political divide have come together to formally ""condemn"" Donald Trump and the comments the GOP candidate has made against Latinos since the beginning of his presidential campaign. In a blistering statement published Tuesday in Spanish on Univision.com, 67 scientists, historians, award-winning authors, lawyers and more from the United States, Latin America and Spain signed a statement denouncing Trump's behavior and asking the American people to ""stop tolerating his absurd views."" Among the most controversial comments and actions cited in the statement include Trump's remarks on Mexican immigrants -- who he called criminals, ""rapists"" and drug traffickers in June -- and his removal of prominent journalist Jorge Ramos from a press conference in August. ""His hate speech appeals to the lowest of sentiments: like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism,"" reads the statement, translated by The Huffington Post from Spanish. ""All of which inevitably is reminiscent of past campaigns aimed against ethnic groups, which resulted in the death of millions of people. In fact, physical aggressions against Hispanics and calls to prohibit the use of Spanish in public have already begun.""""Mr. Trump’s verbal attacks are not based on statistics or proven facts but on his very personal and unfounded opinion,"" the statement continues. ""He not only disrespects immigrant Hispanics (later there could be other ethnic groups) but exhibits a dangerous attitude toward his opponents, who he portrays as stupid and weak.""The group also states that some of Trump's political proposals, which include building a massive wall along the Mexican border and deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, would be detrimental to the United States. ""Mr. Trump’s behavior is unworthy of a candidacy to the presidency of one of the most powerful countries in the world,"" they write at the end of the statement."" We condemn his behavior and hope that the American people will stop tolerating his absurd views.""The statement's extensive list of signees includes Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Díaz, Oscar-winning Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu, Nobel Prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa and Mexican actors Diego Luna and Demián Bichir.Ricky Martin wrote a similarly scathing op-ed posted on Univision.com in August. In his piece, the Puerto Rican singer urged Latinos to unite against Donald Trump.“The fact that a person like Donald Trump… has the gall to continue to freely harass the Latino community day after day makes my blood boil,” the star wrote.Also on HuffPost: "

""It's hard to try to measure. It's a hard thing to grasp ... We're not entirely sure what's going on and we ought to try and figure it out.""Comey said during a University of Chicago Law School forum last month that ""the era of viral videos"" showing police actions that have led to civilian deaths may be discouraging officers from doing their jobs. ""I don't know whether this explains it entirely, but I do have a strong sense that some part of the explanation is a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement over the last year, and that wind is surely changing behavior,"" Comey said. He made similar comments a few days later at the International Association of Chiefs of Police.Rosenberg said Wednesday that police officers are worried “rightly or wrongly that [they] become the next viral video,” ABC News reported. Rosenberg backed Comey even after White House press secretary Josh Earnest condemned the FBI director's comments during a daily news briefing last month. Earnest said there's no evidence to support the claims. “In fact, you hear law enforcement leaders across the country indicating that that’s not what’s taking place,"" he said.The Congressional Research Service found only ""anecdotal and correlational evidence"" to support Comey's comments. It pointed to data showing that an uptick in homicides in St. Louis started before police killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Missouri. Similarly, the service said, arrests in Baltimore were down and homicides were increasing before Freddy Gray was killed in police custody.Rosenberg has close ties with the Department of Justice. Before being appointed DEA administrator in May, he served as Comey's chief of staff. He also served as counselor to former Attorney General John Ashcroft, and was a U.S. attorney in Texas from June 2005 until March 2006.Also on HuffPost:"

As they prepare for a Thursday Night Football battle with Cleveland, do Andy Dalton and the Bengals -- who’ve never won a playoff game together -- really belong in the same conversation as Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, the quarterbacks of the AFC’s other two undefeated teams?The matchup between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati was notable for one other reason: It pitted the league's current two longest-tenured African-American head coaches against each other. That's an annual occurrence in this division, but it's taken on added significance this year in the midst of larger conversations about diversity in sports hiring. Major League Baseball, for instance, was on the verge of its first season since 1987 without a black manager before the Washington Nationals hired Dusty Baker this week. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin noted the importance of going against Bengals head man Marvin Lewis before the game. ""As a younger African-American coach, to see him sail through the ranks is kind of a blueprint for those who have come after him,"" Tomlin told ESPN.com. ""I’m in that group. I’ve got a lot of respect for him on those levels."" HuffPost sports reporter Travis Waldron and former NFL wide receiver Donté Stallworth sit down during this week's episode of ""The Second Half"" podcast to talk about whether the Bengals are finally for real, and the importance of major sports leagues approaching their hiring practices with diversity in mind.Also discussed: The NFL vows to keep Deflategate alive forever, inviting more questions about league discipline; Victor Cruz calls for guaranteed contracts amid a rash of devastating injuries; and we think the New Orleans Saints scored a few more touchdowns on the New York Giants while we were recording.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Adriana Usero and Peter James Callahan, with assistance from Christine Conetta.

6,SPORTS,The NCAA And NFL Need To Stop Arbitrarily Taking Stands On Issues,Erick Fernandez,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ncaa-nfl-final-four-super-bowl-houston_us_563a4d5de4b0307f2cab96c5,"They stood against bigoted laws in the past, why aren't they doing it now?",2015-11-05,Opponents to Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance checking election results.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If there's one thing that remains true in America's capitalistic society, it's that money talks. Start messing with people's money, and you have their attention.So when the city of Houston, Texas, voted against an anti-discrimination ordinance on Wednesday night, the NCAA and the NFL each had a chance to take a strong stand against the city's decision. You see, the NCAA and NFL have chosen Houston as the city to host the men's Final Four in 2016 and Super Bowl 51 in 2017, respectively.They have the ability to revoke that decision. Such a move would show that these sports organizations stand in solidarity with the LGBT community. But as of now, they have not.NFL League spokesman Brian McCarthy told the New York Times Wednesday that Houston's decision “will not affect our plans for Super Bowl LI in 2017.” Dan Gavitt, vice president of Men's Basketball Championships for the NCAA, also issued a statement saying that it will not relocate next year's Final Four. ""The NCAA has no plans to move the 2016 Final Four, as it takes years to plan and implement this world-class event,"" they said.These organizations have political clout. In the past, state government has appeared to listen when the NFL and NCAA have threatened to take their business elsewhere over a social issue. So why aren't they doing it with the city of Houston? What makes the situation in Houston different?How is the situation in Houston different than earlier this year, when NCAA President Mark Emmert and other corporate entities pressured Indiana into making changes to a state law that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against members from the LGBT community?How is the situation in Houston different than when the NCAA prevented the state of South Carolina from hosting NCAA championship tournaments for 15 years because the government flew the Confederate flag on state grounds? How is the situation in Houston different than when the NFL strongly condemned an Arizona bill that would have discriminated against gays and denied them service based on religious freedom? The NFL was reportedly considering relocating Super Bowl XLIX from Phoenix, Arizona to Tampa Bay, Florida because of the law, and Governor Jan Brewer ended up vetoing that bill.Both the NCAA and NFL could taken a powerful stand against Houston's bigoted policy like they have in the past, but right now they are each pulling a ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. This arbitrary decision-making process makes the organizations look bad.If they really wanted to promote inclusivity, they would do so in any city they're doing business with. But right now, they're just picking and choosing. The NFL flexed on Arizona. The NCAA flexed on Indiana. But it appears they are not interested in messing with Texas. Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) brother, Larry Sanders, recently opened up about the presidential candidate's childhood and life in an interview with WNYC and PRI's national radio program ""The Takeaway.""In the interview, the elder Sanders says young Bernie never had any political aspirations but his political outlook was transformed by two key historical moments: the Holocaust and the Civil Rights Movement.The Holocaust wasn't openly discussed in the family, which is Jewish, Larry Sanders told radio host John Hockenberry. Both boys, however, learned that their relatives had been ""gobbled up.""Later, as a young college student at the University of Chicago, Bernie became an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a student organization that played a big role in the Civil Rights Movement. That was a key moment for Bernie, Larry said. ""I think Chicago was a turning point,"" he recalled. ""It was a situation, which called on people and he answered the situation, and I think that did change his life.""During that time, Bernie didn't spend much time in the classroom, preferring instead to get involved on the ground and reading ""voraciously"" at his own will. When asked what he thought about his brother's run for the White House, Larry became emotional as he spoke of how proud he is of his younger brother. ""I see him as a potential great president,"" he said. Larry Sanders has lived in the U.K. since 1969 and is no stranger to politics himself. He has served as a county councilor in East Oxford and he most recently ran as a Green Party candidate in the 2015 U.K. elections. He is now back in the U.S. to support his brother's campaign. Listen to the entire interview here:CORRECTION: Larry Sanders said his brother read ""voraciously,"" not ""ferociously."" "
