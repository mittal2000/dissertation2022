It's as simple as that.",2015-02-17,"FILE -- In this Oct. 24, 2012 file photo, former Chief Justice Roy Moore poses for a photo in his Montgomery, Ala., office. The Alabama Supreme Court is divided over whether the state Legislature is acting legally by rewriting the state Constitution a few portions at a time. Moore and Justice Tom Parker have issued advisory opinions saying the article-by-article approach is not allowed by the Constitution. (AP Photo/Dave Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd673260000cf00816256.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Good news, gay and lesbian couples. Gay marriage is now legal in the state of Alabama!Well, sort of.Last Monday, the United States Supreme Court voted 7-2 to deny a delay on a lower court's decision to strike down Alabama's gay marriage ban. In doing so, the Supreme Court effectively made Alabama the 37th state in the nation where gay marriage is now legal. But Alabama is Alabama -- a state with a long, proud and shameful record of defying federal court orders and ignoring Constitutional law. And in typical Alabama fashion, Alabama has decided once again, as it did in the 1960s with African-Americans, that it will not go gently into that good night!Before the Supreme Court even announced its decision, Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore -- the same Roy Moore who was removed from office in 2003 for defying a federal court order to remove the Ten Commandments from the state Supreme Court building -- issued an order of his own, instructing all probate judges and state employees to ignore the SCOTUS ruling, adhere to state law and deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. As a result, we have a conundrum in Alabama. The Supreme Court says it cannot refuse marriage licenses to gay couples, but its own Chief Justice says it can. And as a result of that, many counties in Alabama don't know what to do. Forget about the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken. Chief Justice Roy Moore made it clear before the court spoke that he had no intention of following its orders. Also, forget about the fact that under the Constitution of the United States, no state -- much less Alabama -- has a legal right to deny its citizens the equal protection of the law. Remember, this is Alabama. What didn't work in the '60s on African-Americans may work today on gays and lesbians! Right?Moore's statements on the issue have been confusing at best. He told CNN's Chris Cuomo that his decision is based on the law, not his own personal beliefs. ""I've never said it was about my faith and religion,"" he told Cuomo. ""It's about the organic law of the country.""But in that same interview, he also told Cuomo ""It's about sexual preference overcoming an institution which has existed in our state for centuries, and I think it's wrong.""You think it's wrong, Mr. Moore, or you know it's wrong under state and federal law? These are two different statements. And it's not clear from your statements where you stand on gay marriage. Of course, this is the same Roy Moore who has let his personal beliefs get in the way of his job before. That's why he was relieved of his duties in 2003. But remember, this is Alabama! What didn't work for Roy Moore in 2003 may work for Roy Moore today. Right?At the end of the day, Roy Moore's personal beliefs don't matter, and neither do the personal beliefs of anybody else in the United States. All that matters is the Constitution, which is very clear on the legal process regarding gay marriage. The 5th Amendment states, ""No person shall... be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.""  A popular vote -- like the one that banned gay marriage in Alabama in 2006 -- is not due process of law.The 14th Amendment states this: ""No state shall... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" That means no state can issue an order or statute that denies equal protection to all its citizens. The executive order issued by Governor Fob James that banned gay marriage in Alabama in 1996? It's illegal and unconstitutional. So are the statutes passed by the Alabama House and Senate that same year -- both are unconstitutional and illegal. This is Constitutional reality, folks. It's not up for debate, and it doesn't matter what your personal beliefs are. But again, this is the same Alabama that defied federal court orders on segregation in the 1960s. Everything, it seems, is up for debate in Alabama! Its own governor, George Wallace, once famously stated ""Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever!"" That didn't work out too well for Wallace, but remember, this is Alabama! What didn't work for George Wallace in the '60s may work today. Right?Enough with the gay marriage hysteria, America. If you disapprove of gay marriage for personal and religious reasons, that's fine. I support your Constitutional right to do so. If Phil Robertson from ""Duck Dynasty"" speaks out against gay marriage, I support his Constitutional right to do so, too, even if I disagree with his words. But, I do not support anything that goes against the Constitution. For the state of Alabama, or any other state, to deny gay couples the equal protection of its laws simply because they're gay is not only wrong and immoral, it's arbitrary, illegal and unconstitutional. It's as simple as that. And remember this, Alabama: The ten states with the lowest divorce rates in America are Connecticut, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Gay marriage is legal in nine of those states. If your ultimate goal is to defend the sanctity of marriage in your state, well, that's great! What's working in those states may work in Alabama.Right?"

She accepted and then I had to scramble to get a reservation, preferably at a restaurant sans the usual outlandish $150 prix fixe New Year's Eve menu. My favorite restaurant in town was owned and run by what is affectionately known as ""goombas."" At any given time there were more loaded concealed firearms in the establishment than a Fort Worth truckstop, but the food was sublime and there were always fascinating people at the bar so it was my favorite place to have a glass of wine and a meal.Around noon on December 31st I called and asked if they were serving the regular menu that evening and after receiving an answer in the affirmative I kindly asked if I could please make a reservation for two people.The hostess guffawed and after composing herself stated, ""I'm sorry but we are completely booked.""I thought for a moment and then my sense of entitlement had the audacity to ask, ""May I please speak with Dominique?""""Hold on,"" she answered placing my sense of entitlement on hold.A minute later another voice bellowed, ""Dominique here.""""Dominique, this is Mister Israel, I'm so sorry to trouble you but I met a woman yesterday and... is there any chance that you could find a spot for us for dinner at eight o'clock this evening, please?""A few seconds of silence alerted me to the fact that I was causing him an undue hassle.""Mister Israel, you have always been a good customer so I will MAKE a table for you this evening but we have a second seating so I have one request...""""Anything. What is it?""""I need you to vacate the table by eleven o'clock.""I knew we had a party to be at by eleven-thirty so it was not going to be a problem to leave the restaurant by eleven.""Absolutely, Dominique. We'll be gone by eleven o'clock. Thank you very very much!""And then it happened.The only way to describe it would be to say that I felt Dominique's muscular hand reach through the telephone cable as he asked formidably and sternly with his gruff Italian accent, ""SO THEN WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING?""This caught my attention and I reflected before gripping his hand to seal the deal. I recalled Al Pacino explaining to Johnny Depp in ""Donnie Brasco"" what it meant when someone says, ""He's a friend of the family."" It meant that the new guy had been vetted and could be trusted 100% and that the speaker of those words was willing to bet his life on it - a bet that Al Pacino loses in the film.He's a friend of the family. We have an understanding.  There was something about the way Dominique said ""an understanding"" that made those words rhyme with ""cement shoes"" and ""Jimmy Hoffa"" more than any other words in my mental dictionary.An understanding between gentlemen. A verbal contract. An agreement. A bond. Old school. Old world, really. For people who recognize that language creates reality. Language creates reality. People who live by the creed that their word is their bond and if they say that they are going to do something or be someplace at a particular time then Goddamnit it shall be.""Yes, we have an understanding,"" I replied.I picked up my date and as we arrived at the restaurant I greeted Dominique with ""Buonasera"" and a handshake and he led us to a makeshift table that was practically in the corridor. That Dominique had taken the time to literally ""make"" a table for me, to add an additional table to the restaurant that evening was truly heart-warming.The food was spectacular as usual and the restaurant was especially vibrant and festive. The date went smoothly and as we exited around 10:50 I shook Dominique's hand with both of my hands and said, ""Everything was lovely. Thank you very much. Happy new year"" the way supplicants deferentially thank Marlon Brando in the first scene of ""The Godfather."" He smiled back to thank me for being a gentleman and keeping up my end of the understanding.After being away from Los Angeles for five years I recently bumped into Dominique at another restaurant and after saying ""Buonasera"" and shaking his hand I reminded him of that New Year's Eve many years ago that he also inexplicably recalled.""You taught me a great lesson,"" I told him. He smiled and knew exactly what I was talking about. We had an understanding.That is mindful speech. :-) "

My parents almost died in a car accident on President's Day 1986.Driving back to Boston on a snowy New Hampshire road, the car my father was driving swerved into oncoming traffic on a two-lane road.A car with a snow plough on the front hit my mother's side. Her seatbelt saved her life.The only reason the paramedics gave her even a one percent chance of living was that they were already out on the road, heard the crash and responded immediately.I flew back from attending college in California to be with my family. I will never forget the first time I saw Mom in the hospital.I had already visited Dad, who, although frail in a way I had never witnessed before, at least could speak. I walked down the white tiled hallways, absorbing the hospital's antiseptic smell. Having worked the previous two summer processing blood gas samples at my father's laboratory, I knew that the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit where Mom was staying was for severe cases. I walked in, shuddering involuntarily when I approached the bed, which was enclosed by a screen.I braced myself and looked.Her eyelids were purple eggplants that covered her closed eyes. Tubes snaked in and out of her body. A respiratory machine pushed air into her lungs though a diamond-shaped hole that had been cut in her throat. The machine hissed inexorably, each push up and down illustrating her utter dependence on it for her tenuous hold on life.I hated the machine.I spoke softly to her.""You'll get better,"" I said, desperation creeping into my voice. ""You'll be out of her soon. Look! You just moved. See? I told you. All right, Mom!""More hissing from the machine.No movement from Mom.The same hospital smell.I kept talking and talking, telling Mom her that I knew she would get better, that she soon would be gone from this room. I uttered words that I did not believe in my heart, but had to say because the alternative was too terrifying.Visiting Mom for the first time was one of the hardest things I ever did, yet it was harder still to come back for the second, third and thirtieth time. But my brothers and I did just that as Mom began the achingly slow, sometimes backward-moving, process of healing.At age 48, she had to relearn basic physical functions like how to stand, walk and control her bladder. The massive closed head injury she sustained meant that she had to learn how to talk again as well as how to conduct herself appropriately in social situations.Due to extensive medical support, an array of caregivers and her tenacious will, Mom has not only recovered, she started a non-profit organization, Vital Active Life After Trauma, to help others who have endured head injuries and other blows. She writes prolifically to this day about her experience and the lessons she has drawn from them.Although she and Dad split shortly after the accident, they have found in divorce a peace and a harmony that often eluded them during their 27 years of marriage.And, while she has had health troubles, most notably a failing heart that led to a pacemaker installation and a hip replacement in 2010, Mom is probably now, for the first time in nearly three decades, at a similar health place to many of her peers. The anniversary provides an annual occasion for reflection.The lessons of the accident, are like a kaleidoscope, shifting constantly depending on the rotation. The initial insights I drew were about how to rally and stay steadfast during a storm.Now a year older than Mom was when she and Dad crashed, I am more viscerally aware of life's fragility and finitude, and of the importance of savoring daily gifts. So on the day that our nation celebrates the births our first president known as the father of our country and an Illinoisan who kept the union intact during its most searing conflict, I give thanks for Mom's survival, for the paramedics who rescued her from the car, and for the battery of people who have helped her heal.I am grateful, too, for the abundant meaning that comes from understanding the present moment in light of the journey we have taken to get there. With Mom in the summer of 2014.  NOTE: Some of this material appeared previously in my book, On My Teacher's Shoulders."
3,GREEN,Birds Tell an Urgent Climate Change Message,"Marcia G. Yerman, ContributorWriter on women's issues, human rights, environment and culture",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/birds-tell-an-urgent-clim_b_6689818.html,"I learned that the Baltimore Oriole may no longer be in Maryland by the end of the century and that coastal species, like the sandpiper, were imperiled by rising sea levels.",2015-02-17,2015-02-16-2012_Allens_Hummingbird_LoiNguyen_AudubonPhotographyAwards.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-16-2012_Allens_Hummingbird_LoiNguyen_AudubonPhotographyAwards-thumb.jpg,"""The canary in the coal mine."" That phrase has become part of the lexicon as a warning for danger.Now birds are cautioning humans about the imminent threat of climate change -- and the news is not good. This from a report based on seven years of research by the National Audubon Society. I checked out their website, which featured material on environmental events -- both national and international. I learned that the Baltimore Oriole may no longer be in Maryland by the end of the century and that coastal species, like the sandpiper, were imperiled by rising sea levels.I reached out to Gary Langham, Audubon's chief scientist, to learn more. Langham has a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Cornell University. We discussed a wide range of topics, and he passionately delivered his insights and concerns.Langham explained that at Audubon, ""Activism is part of the story."" The organization was founded 105 years ago by people alarmed by the slaughter of egrets being killed in order to supply women's hats with ""plumes."" Audubon spearheaded the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the first American law to protect birds from indiscriminate hunting. ""Concerned citizen interface has always be part of the Audubon agenda,"" Langham related. ""All our conservation work to protect birds and nature is based on science, policy, advocacy, and education."" He paused, ""So is standing up and doing the right thing.""Walking me through the top points of the study, Langham detailed that 588 species were examined within the context of how climate change would impact them in 2020, 2050, and 2080. Taking into account the consequences of greenhouse gases, 314 species are going to be highly impacted unless, as Langham emphasized, ""we recalibrate how we consume and generate energy.""Having the longest running animal census in the world (since 1900), Audubon is strategically positioned to contribute to the conversation. Langham discussed ""habitat shifts"" that evolved as a result of a changed landscape over the past century and a half -- an outcome of humans ""converting land use to their own ends."" Alarmingly, in the past forty years, ""even common birds have declined by 40 to 70 percent due to habitat shift.""Langham underscored, ""Birds have an urgent message."" The reason they are on the move is due to climate change. In the past two decades, more than 200 species of birds have moved their ""habitat range"" substantially north in order to achieve comparable living conditions. This migration then impacts the ecosystem where they resettle. Langham stressed, ""All this disruption is not good. Birds are an excellent indicator of nature overall. What impacts them will impact us. As the birds go, so do we.""On the bright side Langham assured me, ""When you give nature half a chance, it can respond in a positive way."" The bottom line is, ""Restorative measures are the key. If we take concerted actions, the birds can recover."" He gave the example of the country's national emblem, the Bald Eagle, which was brought back from the brink after being devastated by the effects of DDT.Commenting on the newly elected representatives in Congress, Langham observed that the ""fingerprints of big oil and gas"" were clearly evident. ""Climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue,"" he insisted. ""It's about doing the right thing for future generations. It's about protecting nature and our children.""When I asked Langham about the XL Pipeline, he was unequivocal in his response. Audubon is officially opposed to it because of the inherent risks and disruptions from spills. Regarding fracking, Langham pointed to the challenges facing birds that nest in the Bakken Shale area of North Dakota. He said succinctly, ""Unregulated chemicals used in fracking are the wild card. What's being pumped into the ground cannot be good for birds or people.""Langham was clear. ""Most of the opposition comes from the extractive industries. They just use nature for their own purposes. They cut it, burn it, or extract it. They want the fewest regulations with the most profits."" For Audubon, supporting renewable energy is a core belief, as is reducing emissions via legislation and public policy.On how he would convey his concern to the average citizen, Langham said, ""Birds often represent or symbolize places in ways that are meaningful to people. The Common Loon is a familiar bird for people out fishing or swimming in the 10,000 lakes of Minnesota. Our Climate Report suggests that loons may no longer be in Minnesota by the end of the century. The idea that one cannot share the call of the loon with kids or grandkids is troubling because it foreshadows not just the loss of the loon, but of one's sense of place.""Langham concluded, ""Climate change threatens everyone's sense of place by introducing ecological disruption on a scale never seen before.""Photo: Loi Nguyen/Audubon Photography Awards This article originally appeared on the website Moms Clean Air Force.

4,WORLDPOST,Four Ways America Can De-escalate the Crisis in Yemen,"Nabeel A. Khoury, ContributorVisiting professor, Middle East Studies, Northwestern Universi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/four-ways-america-can-dee_b_6689906.html,U.S. national interest is definitely at stake in the direction events in Yemen take over the next few months.,2015-02-17,"SANA'A, YEMEN - FEBRUARY 14: Yemenis shout slogans during a rally against the occupation of the capital by Shiite Houthi rebels in front of Ministry of youth and sport building at Zubeyri Street on February 14, 2015 in the capital Sanaa, Yemen. (Photo by Mohammed Hamoud/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14557240000140a51b773.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So it comes to this. Four years after the Yemeni uprising and a hopeful beginning for a new democracy in the region, U.S. and European powers give in to an armed takeover of the capital Sanaa and pull their diplomats out. The U.S. ambassador's departure comes only four months after President Obama touted Yemen as a counter-terrorism success story, totally ignoring the fact that the country was falling apart with nary an American attempt to intercede diplomatically to help local power centers patch up their differences. It's a triumph -- albeit a still incomplete one -- for the Houthi rebels, who now inherit a central government in shambles and a country divided and on the brink of civil war. It is also a success for Iran, whose support for the Houthi rebels is no longer a secret affair in terms of its regional struggle with Saudi Arabia. For the U.S., it's another foreign policy dilemma with the emergence of yet another dangerous spot for Americans in the Middle East. The Houthis had a relatively easy time getting into Sanaa. Their expansion southwards and eastwards, however, is meeting stiff resistance. Ma'rib, the oil-producing region east of Sanaa, mobilized tribal opposition and have so far blocked the Houthis' advance into their government. The Hirak leaders in south Yemen have rejected Houthi overtures to them and have declared their opposition to the Houthi takeover of Sanaa. Ta'iz, the second largest urban center in Yemen, has witnessed daily demonstrations in the same vein as Aden's protests. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, having fought the Houthis in the north, are putting up a costly (to the Houthis) fight near their own stronghold in the south. All these ongoing battles have the potential to involve neighboring powers, especially Saudi Arabia, which cannot abide a Houthi-controlled Yemen on its borders. WHAT WENT WRONGThe Houthis, a Zaidi tribe and the largest and most powerful of its sect in the north, grew militarily out of seven years of consecutive wars against the central government in Sanaa. Zaidism, having historically branched off of Shia Islam, has always had distant and mostly dormant kinship with the broader Shia community in Iraq, Iran and the Levant. These dormant links were awakened by the brief entry of Saudi Arabia into Sanaa's war with the Houthis in 2009 and the 2011 youth uprising which shook the Saleh regime in Sanaa http://goo.gl/KL4lSS. The opportunity to take advantage of the Houthis' growing strength and the power vacuum in Sanaa was too tempting for Tehran to pass up.To be fair, by the time the Houthis took Sanaa back in September 2014, there was very little the U.S. and its Western allies could do to stop the takeover. At that point, this was certainly no place for the U.S. or N.A.T.O. to take a military stand. The decision to shut down the embassy was also inevitable, given the deteriorating security situation, the lack of contacts with the Houthi rebels and a dubious connection with Iran, which could easily complicate the embassy's security profile. This is another stitch-in-time story though -- another spot in the region where early preventative diplomacy might have had a positive impact. As in Syria, so in Yemen: policies that could have saved the day in 2011 are no longer sufficient. Diplomacy, backed by force or the threat of force, could have empowered the Syrian secular opposition in 2011 -- when they were the only game in town -- at least to the point of making balanced negotiations possible between them and the Syrian regime. The allied effort is costlier now and with questionable impact on the ground as violence spreads and endangers the entire region. A decisive role in intra-Yemeni diplomacy back in 2011 could similarly have kept the U.S. in the mediation game and given it a chance to try to keep the country together without much expenditure in either blood or treasure. That opportunity to mediate has come and gone. The next U.S. intervention will be costlier, and it may well become necessary at some point -- if not against an overly-ambitious Houthi movement, then against an emboldened al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. WAYS AMERICA CAN HELP1. Ask Iran to help moderate the Houthis.  Iran's leaders have now admitted their involvement on the side of the Houthis and, after the decline of Saudi influence there starting in 2009, Iran may, for the time being, be the only regional power with influence in Yemen. Such a request, however, would have to be part of a tough and comprehensive regional deal -- the kind that has not yet been tried with Iran, where the focus has thus far been on the P5+1 nuclear power talks. Saudi Arabia would also have to be on board because of its vital interests in Yemen. Hezbollah's probable involvement, at least as a model for the Houthis, further complicates this admittedly far-fetched option. 2. Empower Qatar to talk to all sides of the conflict. As a Gulf Cooperation Council member with no direct interests at stake, Qatar has had successful mediation efforts in Yemen in the past. The ongoing attempts of the U.N. envoy, Jamal Benomar, to restart the national dialogue process would be enhanced by Qatar's active participation. Doha's diplomacy would complement his efforts, and Qatari funds could be the needed carrot in terms of the reconstruction of the north -- a region devastated by a decade of continuous war.3. Empower the U.N. envoy.  Jamal Benomar has engaged in some heroic diplomatic efforts since 2011, reaching out to all political parties in Yemen, bringing them to the national dialogue table and presiding over an agreement signed by all, including the Houthis, to pave the way for a new constitution and new elections to follow. The U.S. endorsed his efforts and offered new economic assistance to Yemen, which alas was too difficult to spend, given deteriorating security conditions. However, in recent years, U.S. diplomacy was limited to the two main power blocs: the opposition Joint Meeting Parties (al-Tajammu') and Ali Abdallah Saleh's ruling General People's Congress. The Houthis, the southern Hirak (in its three factions) and the southern opposition overseas -- all important power centers -- remained outside the scope of U.S. diplomacy and therefore influence. Empowering the U.N. envoy would require the U.S. to be more directly involved in Benomar's efforts, offering incentives to those who cooperate and disincentives to those who insist on being an obstacle. 4. Back up its verbal support with a threat and a promise. A threat to intervene forcefully should the Houthi advance continue against south Yemen, and a promise to coordinate and support a major reconstruction effort should the Yemeni parties agree to a new government with full participation by all regions and power centers in the country -- two options which Benomar was never authorized to offer.These options are not mutually exclusive and are well within the capability of U.S. diplomacy. The U.S. national interest is definitely at stake in the direction events in Yemen take over the next few months. Should the Houthis succeed in subduing the south, Iran's military assistance and influence will have reached Bab al-Mandeb, the strategic entrance to the Red Sea, giving Iran a stronger hand in overall regional and international politics. Should the Houthis fail in their thrust eastward and southward, the fighting will continue with southern leaders and eastern tribes. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula would benefit immensely from the ensuing chaos and further expand its hold on the ground in Yemen, along with its ability to plot terrorist operations regionally and internationally. U.S. leadership is essential, both for U.S. security interests, as well as for the security and stability of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and the broader Middle East."

I mean, if you retain a capacity for wonder you can still be awed by a sunset, but should you really be shocked that the sun is once again sinking in the West? Maybe not.The occasion for such reflections: machine guns in my hometown. To be specific, several weeks ago, New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton announced the formation of a new 350-officer Special Response Group (SRG). Keep in mind that New York City already has a police force of more than 34,000 -- bigger, that is, than the active militaries of Austria, Bulgaria, Chad, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Kenya, Laos, Switzerland, or Zimbabwe -- as well as its own “navy,” including six submersible drones. Just another drop in an ocean of blue, the SRG will nonetheless be a squad for our times, trained in what Bratton referred to as “advanced disorder control and counterterror.” It will also, he announced, be equipped with “extra heavy protective gear, with the long rifles and machine guns -- unfortunately sometimes necessary in these instances.” And here’s where he created a little controversy in my hometown. The squad would, Bratton added, be “designed for dealing with events like our recent protests or incidents like Mumbai or what just happened in Paris.”Now, that was an embarrassment in liberal New York. By mixing the recent demonstrations over the police killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and others into the same sentence with the assault on Mumbai and the Charlie Hebdo affair in France, he seemed to be equating civil protest in the Big Apple with acts of terrorism. Perhaps you won’t be surprised then that the very next day the police department started walking back the idea that the unit would be toting its machine guns not just to possible terror incidents but to local protests. A day later, Bratton himself walked his comments back even further. (“I may have in my remarks or in your interpretation of my remarks confused you or confused the issue.”) Now, it seems there will be two separate units, the SRG for counterterror patrols and a different, assumedly machine-gun-less crew for protests.Here was what, like the sun going down in the West, shouldn’t have shocked me but did: no one thought there was any need to walk back the arming of the New York Police Department with machine guns for whatever reasons. The retention of such weaponry should, of course, have been the last thing to shock any American in 2015. After all, the up-armoring and militarization of the police has been an ongoing phenomenon since 9/11, even if it only received real media attention after the police, looking like an army of occupation, rolled onto the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, in response to protests over the killing of Michael Brown.In fact, the Pentagon (and the Department of Homeland Security) had already shunted $5.1 billion worth of military equipment, much of it directly from the country’s distant battlefields -- assault rifles, land-mine detectors, grenade launchers, and 94,000 of those machine guns -- to local police departments around the country. Take, for example, the various tank-like, heavily armored vehicles that have now become commonplace for police departments to possess. (Ferguson, for instance, had a “Bearcat,” widely featured in coverage of protests there.)Since 2013, the Pentagon has transferred for free more than 600 mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, or MRAPs, worth at least half a million dollars each and previously used in U.S. war zones, to various “qualified law enforcement agencies.” Police departments in rural areas like Walsh County, North Dakota (pop. 11,000) now have their own MRAPs, as does the campus police department at Ohio State University. It hardly matters that these monster vehicles have few uses in a country where neither ambushes nor roadside bombs are a part of everyday life.Post-Ferguson, a few scattered departments have actually moved to turn these useless vehicles back in. It's clear, however, that police forces “kitted out with Marine-issue camouflage and military-grade body armor, toting short-barreled assault rifles, and rolling around in armored vehicles” -- that is, almost indistinguishable from soldiers -- are now the future of American policing and there’s no walking that back. Since Ferguson, President Obama has essentially refused to do so and Congress certainly won’t. Despite a small uproar over the pile of military equipment being transferred to the police, there is no indication that the flow will be staunched.When it comes to all this militarized equipment, as the president has emphasized (and the task force he appointed to look into these matters will undoubtedly reemphasize), “reform” is mainly going to be focused on “better training” in how to use it. In other words, reform will prove to be a code word for further militarization. And don’t count on anyone returning those 94,000 machine guns either in a country that seems to be in some kind of domestic arms race and in which toddlers now regularly find their parents’ loaded guns and wound or kill them.How the National Security State Outlasted Its CriticsNot so long ago, that 9/11 “changed everything” seemed like the hyperbolic cliché of a past era. From the present moment, however, it looks ever more like a sober description of what actually happened. Congratulations, that is, are due to Osama bin Laden. Even dead and buried at sea, he deserves some credit. He proved to be midwife to the exceedingly violent birth of a new American world. Today, 13 years after the attacks he launched, an exceptionally healthy, well-armed teenage America is growing fast. Under the banner of Fear and Terror that bin Laden inspired, this country has been transformed in myriad ways, even if we only half notice because we’re part of it. And it isn’t a world much interested in walking anything back. Consider the National Security Agency. In June 2013, it was faced with the beginning of a devastating rollout of a trove of top-secret documents exposing its inner workings. Thanks to Edward Snowden, Americans (and Germans and Brazilians and Mexicans and Afghans) came to know that the agency had, in the post-9/11 years, set up a surveillance state for the ages, one for which the phrase Orwellian might be distinctly inadequate. The NSA was listening in on or intercepting the communications of 35 chancellors, presidents, and other world leaders, the secretary-general of the U.N., the offices of the European Union, foreign corporations, peasants in the backlands of the planet, and oh yes, American citizens galore (and that’s just to start down a far longer list). All of this effort has -- from the point of view of “intelligence” -- been remarkably expensive but (as far as anyone can tell) relatively useless. Few terrorists have been found, next to no plots broken up, and little useful, actionable intelligence provided to the government, despite the yottabytes of data collected. The whole effort should have been written off as a bust and scaled back radically. The agency’s methods arguably violated the Constitution, made a mockery of the idea of privacy, and tore up sovereignties of every sort. Instead, that global surveillance system remains embedded in our world and growing, its actions sanctified.Clearly, in the new post-9/11 American rulebook, no one was to have the right to keep a secret -- except the national security state itself, which was madly classifying anything in sight, while the Obama Justice Department went after anyone who leaked anything about it or blew a whistle on it with a fierceness never before experienced in our history. Hence, the towering anger of top NSA officials (and their retired colleagues) at Edward Snowden when he exposed their “privacy” to scrutiny, too.If ever there was a system in need of “reform,” this was it. And yet the NSA has successfully outlasted the long Snowden moment without a single thing being walked back, not even the most shocking revelation for Americans: that the agency was gathering and storing their bulk phone “metadata.” A year ago, a presidential advisory board on privacy concluded that the bulk data collection was “illegal and unproductive” and recommended changes. None have yet taken place. “Reform” efforts on the NSA collapsed in Congress even before the Republicans took the Senate. As with the police, so the president has announced minor “tweaks” to the system of data collection and it’s marching right on.Similarly, the CIA outlasted Senator Dianne Feinstein. After years of effort, a truncated, redacted version of the executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Torture Report that she oversaw was finally released, filled with American horrors and barbarities. The result, as with Snowden’s revelations, was nada. For torture, no one at the CIA is to be held responsible or accountable; nor did the CIA pay any price for hacking into the computer systems of the committee’s staff or turning on the woman once known as the senator from the national security state. The whole process seemed to signal that congressional oversight of the U.S. intelligence community was now more fiction than fact.Admittedly, when President Obama came into office, in what may be the single exception to the rule of the era, he walked back one crucial set of Bush administration policies, ending torture and closing the “black sites” at which much of it occurred. Since then, however, the CIA has expanded, while its power, like the national security state within which it is lodged, has only grown.The process of expanding that shadow government and freeing it from supervision has, in fact, been unending. Only last week, for instance, the Obama administration announced that the 17 intelligence outfits that make up the U.S. Intelligence Community were about to get a new baby. Amid a thicket of outfits now devoted to cyberintelligence, including “cyber-operations centers” at the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the National Security Agency, the new Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, which will be housed in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, will “analyze cyberthreats and coordinate strategy to counter them.” It will assumedly be the civilian equivalent of the military’s 2009 creation, the U.S. Cyber Command. And keep in mind that all this is happening in the country that is responsible for launching the planet’s first cyberwar.Or consider another growth industry: drones and their progeny. They are spinning off into domestic air space at a startling rate and can now be found from America’s borderlands to thousands of feet up in the skies above commercial jetliners to the White House grounds (reportedly thanks to the recreational activities of a drunken employee of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency). Abroad, Washington’s drones have been this country's true “lone wolf” hunters, inflicting terror from the skies on Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya in 2011, and most recently Syria. In five of those seven countries they have been at it for years, in the case of Pakistan flying hundreds of strikes in its tribal borderlands.Washington’s grimly named Predator and Reaper drones have been hunting their prey in the backlands of the planet 24 hours a day for more than a decade now. Thousands of people have been wiped out, including women, children, and wedding parties, as well as numerous significant and insignificant figures in terror outfits of every sort. And yet in not one of those countries has the situation improved in any significant way in terms of U.S. policy goals. In most of them it has grown worse and the drones have been a factor in such developments, alienating whole populations on the ground below. This has been obvious for years to counterinsurgency experts. But a reconsideration of these drone wars is beyond the pale in Washington. Drone assassination is now a sacrosanct act of the American state, part of a “global” war 13 years old and ongoing. No one in any position of power, now or in the immediate future, is going to consider flying them back.The CIA has sometimes been called the president’s private army. Today, it's running most (but not all) of Washington’s drone campaigns and so those robotic lone wolves could be considered the president’s private air force. In the process, the twenty-first-century White House has been officially and proudly turned into an assassin’s lair and don’t expect that to change in 2016 or 2020 either.Permanent War and the Permanent Election CampaignSimilar points could be made about the 13-year-old “global war” the Bush administration launched and the specific wars, raids, conflicts, invasions, and occupations that have been carried out under its aegis. President Obama has been fighting Iraq War 3.0 and Syria War 1.0 for six months, claiming that Congressional post-9/11 authorizations allow him to do so. Now, he wants a three-year extension on something he claims he doesn't need and has delivered a text to Congress filled with enough loopholes to send an army (and air force) through -- and not just in Iraq and Syria either. Not getting this authorization wouldn’t, however, significantly affect the administration’s plans in the Middle East. So much for the ""power"" of Congress to declare war. That body is nonetheless evidently going to spend months holding hearings and “debating” a new authorization, even as fighting goes on without it, based on informal agreements pounded out by the White House and the Pentagon. (Alice would have found Wonderland sane by comparison.)In this way, the White House has in our time become a war-making and assassination-producing machine. In the same period, terror groups and membership in them have leapt across the Greater Middle East and Africa; no terror organization has been destroyed (though the original al-Qaeda, a modest enough outfit to begin with, has been weakened); most have expanded; the Islamic State, the first mini-terror state in history, has taken over significant parts of Iraq and Syria and is expanding elsewhere; Libya is a chaos of competing militias, some of an extreme Islamic nature; Yemen is believed to be in a state of collapse with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula on the rise; Afghanistan remains a war disaster area; Pakistan is significantly destabilized; and so on. And yet, as the president’s authorization request indicates, there is no walking any of this back.In the meantime, on the domestic front in this “too big to fail” century, the country that eternally sallies forth under the banner of democracy has been working on a new political system which, as yet, has no name. Here’s what we do know about our latest version of “democracy”: in a period when plenty of American citizens weren’t too small to fail, the inequality gap has grown to yawning proportions. On the principle that what goes up must come down, some part of the vast infusion of money flowing to the .01% or even the .001% has, with a helping hand from the Supreme Court, been raining down on the electoral system.In the same way that the national security state was funded to the tune of almost a trillion dollars a year and war became perpetual, the new political system, focused on TV advertising, has created a perpetual campaign season. (It is now estimated that the 2016 presidential campaign alone could cost $5 billion, essentially doubling the $2.6 billion spent in 2012.) And here’s the most recent news from that round-the-clock campaign, whose focus is increasingly on donors, not voters: the Koch brothers and their allied donor networks have pledged nearly one billion dollars for election season 2016 (more than double the amount they contributed in 2012). And they already have pledges for $249 million, which suggests that they may even exceed their present guesstimate.Despite comments from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg about her personal desire to roll back the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that opened the floodgates of money, it’s clear that this court won’t be walking its election-financing positions back anytime soon. In donor terms, think of what that court did as the equivalent of the Pentagon putting all those machine guns and MRAPs in the hands of the police.And keep in mind that, as the U.S. changes, the world does, too. Consider it a form of reverse blowback, as from drones to surveillance to cyberwar, Washington helps lay the groundwork for a new more extreme century in which, from sovereignty to privacy, boundaries are there to be broken, new kinds of weaponry to be tested out in the real world, and new kinds of conflicts to be launched.In sum, we, the people, are ever less in control of anything. The police are increasingly not “ours,” nor are the NSA and its colleague outfits “our” intelligence agencies, nor are the wars we are fighting “our” wars, nor the elections in which we vote “our” elections. This is a country walking back nothing as it heads into a heavily militarized future. In the process, an everyday American world is being brought into existence that, by past standards, will seem extreme indeed. In other words, in the years to come an ever-less recognizable American way of life will quite expectably be setting in the West. Don’t be shocked.

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd6742400003100551a7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For several weeks now, GOP congressman Aaron Schock of Peoria, Illinois, has been at the center of a great deal of negative media attention because of things he has seemed to be -- or is alleged to be -- hiding. There's the revelation two weeks ago of his allegedly Downton Abbey-inspired office, which Schock's press secretary tried to keep a reporter from writing about. (The press secretary, days after coming under media scrutiny for his attempt to block the story, resigned after his racist Facebook posts were revealed.) There's also the sale of Schock's home to a former Caterpillar executive and political supporter for a price well above the market. And there are his myriad of trips, some to far-off locales on chartered planes and including a paid personal photographer, which are raising question regarding who paid for them. All of this has inspired ethics complaints against Schock in addition to the negative media coverage. But the one thing reporters are not talking about openly -- yet appear to be wink-winking and nudge-nudging about -- is the question of Schock's sexual orientation. This is glaring and curious. The possibility that Schock is gay has been discussed openly, both on hundreds of blogs as well in the traditional media. That happened both when Schock, who has voted anti-gay, set off lots of gaydars online and on social media (like when he wore white pants, a magenta gingham shirt and a teal belt to the White House picnic, or when he posed shirtless for Mens' Health) and after former CBS reporter Itay Hod wrote on Facebook that a friend of his, a TV journalist, had told him he'd walked in on Schock and the TV journalist's roommate coming out of the shower together. Even the Washington Post, in an opinion piece by Jonathan Capehart, openly discussed Hod's Facebook post, using Schock's name. That claim by Itay Hod and the media attention it spurred was little over a year ago. It's odd that it's missing now in virtually all the current coverage, because it's a part of Schock's media history that also points to deception. More interesting is how the media runs from this story, refusing to investigate it while looking into all other aspects of Schock's political life -- yet the possibility that he is gay is part of his political life. Just as he's denied wrongdoing with regard to who paid for his office makeover or his trips, Schock denied being gay when I asked him in 2012 in the context of his anti-gay votes. He did not do this by saying, ""I'm not gay,"" but by saying the question was ""ridiculous"" and pointing to a denial from years past, saying, ""I've said that before, and I don't think it's worthy of further response. I think you can look it up."" The question is relevant because if Schock is gay, then he is a hypocrite, since he voted against the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" and has said he was against gay marriage and for a federal marriage amendment. There are few more stellar examples of past possible deceptions that relate to the current stories about Schock.That doesn't mean Schock's possibly being gay hasn't been alluded to in the current coverage, however, through code words that show how backward we often still are as a society on homosexuality, as if we've not moved past the 1950s. Both Roll Call and The New York Times, for example, have called Schock ""flamboyant,"" and The Guardian, in an article about the allegedly Downton-inspired office, noted that the decor was ""dangerously flamboyant,"" after first mentioning the White House picnic outfit.Come on, folks. ""Flamboyant"" is a word that was most used to describe Liberace but is hardly used to describe any straight male in the public eye. In fact, the Times headlined its obituary of the then-closeted Liberace like this: ""Liberace, Flamboyant Pianist, Dead."" And in the Times last September, in a review of Behind the Candelabra, the Liberace biopic, reviewer Mike Hale describe Liberace as ""a famously flamboyant, closeted-in-plain-sight gay entertainer.""In the recent piece about Schock's current troubles, the Times not only describes the congressman as ""flamboyant"" but discusses his ""ripped ab muscles,"" his ""racy"" Instagram account and his ""lifestyle"" -- a word that is often used pejoratively to discuss gays, as in the ""gay lifestyle."" In fact, the word ""lifestyle"" has come up quite a bit in much of the coverage. It's hard to believe that reporters in D.C. and beyond didn't follow the past discussion of Schock's sexual orientation. Still, I'm not saying all or even most of the code words being used in these articles now are intentional. A lot of it may be unconscious. And Schock is, after all, leading quite a flamboyant lifestyle, painting his office red, posing on the cover of magazines shirtless and jetting around the world and showing it all off. But whether it's intentional, unconscious, or coincidental, the lack of any overt discussion (or investigation) of Schock's sexual orientation, while wink-wink words keep popping up, betrays a lot. As I discuss at length in my next book, the media and many LGBT activists themselves often breathlessly talk about polls that point to increased acceptance of homosexuality and LGBT rights, as if we've nearly won the war. But when the media still views the possibility that someone is gay as, at best, something that would be too damagingly invasive to report on or, at worst, a dirty little secret -- even when it's relevant or interesting to report on -- then we have surely got a long way to go.Michelangelo Signorile's next book, It's Not Over: Getting Beyond Tolerance, Defeating Homophobia, and Winning True Equality, will be published in April by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.Also on The Huffington Post:"

This is a very intense job.”Asked about her replacement, the Supreme Court justice demurred.""My successor will be the choice of whatever president is sitting at that time,"" she said.Carmon and Ginsburg talked at length about the progress that's been made on women's rights since the 1970s, when Ginsburg co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. “Our goal in the ‘70s was to end the ‘closed-door’ era,” Ginsburg said. “There were so many things that were off limits to women -- policing, firefighting, mining, piloting planes.

Really?On Monday, Feb. 16, European officials ""handed Athens an ultimatum: Agree by Friday to continue with a bailout program or risk the funding that the country needs to avoid a default,"" The New York Times reported.Then there is Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany's finance minister and die-hard supporter of the failed austerity policies that brought Greece six years of depression. On Feb. 11, according to the Financial Times, he ""hinted darkly that a Greek plan to leave the bailout at the end of the month could draw a harsh reaction from financial markets.""""I wouldn't know how financial markets will handle it, without a programme -- but maybe [Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras] knows better.""Schäuble knows very well that it is not ""the markets"" that will decide how much capital flows out of the Greek banking system if it fails to renew the troika program that expires Feb. 28. He knows that it is the actions of the European Central Bank (ECB) that will determine how the markets will react. His transparent threat is like that of a gangster shaking down a store owner, pretending not to know who is responsible for the vandalism that happens to afflict businesses that don't make their payments to the mob.And it's not just payments that he is shaking down Greece for but a commitment to transform the Greek economy into something that voters never wanted. Among the ""reforms"" that Schäuble is insisting upon are measures that will further weaken the bargaining power of labor. These include moving away from industry-wide collective bargaining to negotiation at the firm level, making collective dismissals easier, and legalizing employer lockouts (currently illegal in Greece).Many observers don't seem to get it, but this is all about the European authorities using coercion to accomplish political as well as economic goals. That's why these people have not been content to just rely on their enormous bargaining power and the threat of economic dislocation that would ensue if Greece is forced out of the euro. Instead, they have been proactive: On Feb. 4 the ECB announced that it would no longer accept Greek government bonds as collateral. This was a deliberate effort to crash Greek financial markets and increase capital flight so as to force Syriza to capitulate as soon as possible. There appear to be important divisions within the troika. According to press reports, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has been challenging German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the issue of austerity.In short, Syriza, having chosen to stay within the eurozone, has had little choice but to try and make its struggle Europe's struggle, in order to force a change in eurozone-wide policies. Since austerity has failed miserably not only in Greece but in almost all of the eurozone, this is possible -- and is some European authorities' greatest fear at the moment.Their other fear, of course, is that Greece will be forced out of the euro. It is commonly stated that this could cause some kind of European financial collapse, but that appears unlikely. Much more likely is that Greece, after an initial financial crisis, would recover much faster than its neighbors, and others would also want to leave. That is another reason that coercion is such an important element here. To be effective, coercion must go beyond the present crisis and present the threat of chaos even after the (presently still unlikely) event that Greece would leave the euro. (The mafia is threatening not only you but your family after you are killed.) That was part of the threat to Argentina in 2001 and into 2002, even after its default and devaluation. The consensus opinion, which included virtually all of the major media, was that Argentina's troubles were just beginning and there would be years of suffering ahead. As it turned out, Argentina suffered a severe financial crisis and recession, but only for three months. Freed from the IMF's austerity policies, it then began a robust recovery in which GDP grew by 63 percent over the next six years. Greece would appear to be much better situated for an economic recovery outside the eurozone than Argentina was after its devaluation and default. Argentina got no outside help; on the contrary, multilateral institutions drained money from the economy in 2002. Greece might not need any outside help, since it is running a current account surplus. But if it did, according to press reports, Russia (with $380 billion in reserves) and China (with $3.9 trillion) have offered assistance. The amounts of money that Greece might need to borrow would be trivial for China, and pretty small for Russia too. So European coercion would come into play in the event of an exit too. The European authorities could try to block trade credits (this was another threat to Argentina) and otherwise injure the Greek financial system. They could try to pressure China and other countries not to provide loans. But it is unlikely that they would succeed in isolating Greece, and it is not clear that they could get political support in Europe for this kind of vindictiveness.For now, at least, the coercion does not seem to be intimidating the Greeks. Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis made it clear on Monday that ultimatums would not be accepted. Tsipras' approval rating is running at 75 percent, including 42 percent of those who voted for the then-ruling party in the January election. This is a triumph of democracy for Greece, and for Europe."

Lawmakers in at least four states are considering a back-door way to dampen corporate political spending: Require shareholders to approve it.State legislators in Maine, Maryland, New York and New Jersey have introduced bills that demand that a majority of shareholders approve corporate gifts to political committees or candidates.Maryland’s bill is set to get a hearing from lawmakers this week. And more legislative buzz may be coming: The sponsor of the Maryland bill said he’s heard from about a dozen legislators from different states who are interested in the idea.Supporters see the bills as a way to limit the influence of the landmark 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which ruled corporations had a right to spend unlimited amounts of money calling for the election or defeat of candidates. The decision affected laws in about half the states. Companies with deep pockets are now seen as major players in elections at all levels. Top-spending business and trade groups gave more than $48 million to races for state-level candidates in 2014, and more than $211 million to state-level ballot measure campaigns, according to two recent Center for Public Integrity analyses. “The whole thesis of Citizens United is that the companies are just speaking for the shareholders,” said state Sen. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat who is sponsoring the bill in Maryland. “If this is going to be anything more than a cynical fiction, then state legislatures need to act to make it real.”Raskin’s bill would require corporations to get shareholders’ approval for an annual political budget and a slate of candidates or committees the money would support. It would only apply to businesses incorporated in Maryland.The Maryland Chamber of Commerce calls the idea impractical.“The bill creates an unworkable scenario for corporations, to be forced to poll their shareholders when they want to make a decision like this,” said Matthew Palmer, senior vice president of government affairs for the chamber.Raskin said he believes the idea behind his bill is gaining steam after The Washington Post and The Nation published columns he wrote supporting it, and after Congress failed to pass a constitutional amendment meant to overturn Citizens United last fall. About a dozen legislators in other parts of the U.S. contacted him since the articles were published in October, he said, hoping to draft similar bills.Maine Rep. Deane Rykerson, a Democrat, is among the imitators. His bill is modeled on Raskin’s. “This is not really a total rejection of Citizens United, but it’s a step on the way, temporarily anyway,” he said.Rykerson’s bill would go one step further than Maryland’s — it would require corporations to give dissenting shareholders a pro-rated rebate for any political spending they don’t support.Politics investigations in your inbox: Sign up for the Center for Public Integrity's Watchdog email.“Shareholders can be subsidizing speech they find abhorrent through their stock ownership,” said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a think tank that supports campaign finance reform. Torres-Spelliscy commended the shareholder approach, pointing to similar laws in the United Kingdom. But she said that if campaign finance activists want widespread change they will eventually need Delaware to pass a shareholder-approval law, as most corporations in the U.S. plant themselves there due to favorable tax laws.In the past, campaign finance reformers have looked to activist shareholders to demand that corporations disclose political donations. They’ve also made an unsuccessful attempt to get the Securities and Exchange Commission to make companies reveal their political giving.Many do voluntarily, but it’s not mandatory. Some of the nation’s largest companies voluntarily reported giving about $173 million to politically active nonprofits in roughly a single year, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis last year.Some states already have disclosure laws for corporate political giving, or require a corporation’s board to approve political contributions before a company can give. But no state has passed a law requiring shareholder approval, according to Torres-Spelliscy.They may not succeed this year, either. A Hawaii senate committee already tabled a version of the bill introduced there in January. New Jersey’s and New York’s bills each have only one sponsor and have languished in committees since being introduced in recent months.However, in Maine, Rykerson’s bill enjoys bipartisan support, with eight Democrats, two independents and one Republican lined up behind it.“I think there’s a chance it will pass, and, if nothing else, it will raise awareness about the issue,” Rykerson said.In Maryland, Raskin is hopeful, even though two incarnations of similar bills died in committee in prior years. The senator doesn’t consider newly elected Republican Gov. Larry Hogan an impossible obstacle, pointing out that he’s Maryland’s first governor elected after accepting public financing for his campaign, limiting his ability to raise money elsewhere. Raskin also said he met with the governor and discussed the idea.“I think he has an open mind about campaign finance reform, so we’ll see,” Raskin said.A spokesman for Hogan said the governor’s office would not comment on pending legislation.Copyright 2015 The Center for Public Integrity"

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras nominated Prokopis Pavlopoulos as his party's candidate for country's president. (Photo by Ayhan Mehmet/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1456f240000030a51b77d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Renee Maltezou and Karolina TagarisBRUSSELS/ATHENS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - A war of words between Greece and EU paymaster Germany escalated on Tuesday with Athens' new leftist prime minister rejecting what he called ""blackmail"" to extend an international bailout and vowing to rush through laws to reverse labor reforms.A source close to the government said Greece intends to ask on Wednesday for an extension for up to six months of a loan agreement with the euro zone, on conditions to be negotiated. The source drew a distinction between a loan agreement and the full bailout program which the government insists is dead.However hardline German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble dismissed the Greek gambit, telling broadcaster ZDF: ""It's not about extending a credit program but about whether this bailout program will be fulfilled, yes or no.""Financial markets held their nerve after the latest talks among euro zone finance ministers broke down late on Monday and EU partners gave Greece until the end of the week to request an extension or lose financial assistance.Many investors believe that whatever the rhetoric, both sides will find a face-saving formula before Athens' credit lines expire in 10 days. If they fail, Greece could rapidly run out of cash and need its own currency.Greek banking sources said outflows of deposits increased on Tuesday after the failure of Monday's talks, but were not as severe as on some days last month around the election of a radical anti-austerity government.The European Central Bank will review emergency funding for Greek banks on Wednesday but should not cut the lifeline this week, a source familiar with the situation said. Both sides continue to insist Greece will remain in the euro.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told lawmakers in his Syriza party that the government - elected to scrap the bailout, repeal hated austerity measures and end cooperation with the ""troika"" of EU, ECB and IMF lenders - would not compromise.Greece would no longer be treated like a colony of a pariah in Europe, Tsipras said. He accused Schaeuble of losing his cool and making degrading comments about Greece and said ""certain circles"" in the euro zone were out to undermine his government.Schaeuble, 72, hammered home a take-it-or-leave-it message, wondering sarcastically whether Tsipras and his ""famous economist"" of a finance minister knew what they wanted or were making the right choices for the Greek people.""The question still remains if Greece wants a program at all or not,"" he told reporters in Brussels after another day of meetings in Brussels. ""On Feb. 28, at midnight, it's over.""Seasoned Eurocrats said Tsipras and his team seemed unprepared, unrealistic and oblivious to the dangers they are courting by refusing to roll over a 240-billion-euro credit deal and demanding easier terms.Tsipras, 40, said he was in no rush and would not give in to ""blackmail"" from technocrats - a new hint that he hoped hitherto unresponsive EU leaders would step in and clinch a political agreement with him, which they declined to do last week.Two of his EU peers who may be trying to broker a compromise - Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi - telephoned the Greek leader on Tuesday, their offices said without giving details.EU officials were unsure whether his fierce rhetoric was aimed at bolstering domestic support to avert a backlash against eventual compromise, or signaled he was retreating from a deal.GLIMMERS OF COMPROMISEGreek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis - an academic economist - dismissed suggestions his only option was to ask for the bailout to be extended. He said he had been ready to sign a text floated by EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici that Greek officials said called for the ""loan agreement"" to be extended as part of a ""transition"" to a new deal.The Greek plan to request an extended ""loan agreement"" may be an attempt to revive the Moscovici formula shunned by euro zone ministers.French Finance Minister Michel Sapin suggested Greece could win leeway to run a smaller budget surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP and said clinching a deal was largely a matter of finding the right words. It was not clear whether Sapin's compromise ideas had any backing from Germany or other euro zone hardliners.Tsipras raised the stakes by vowing to legislate fast to scrap labor market deregulation brought in by his conservative predecessor to meet international creditors' demands for less protection for workers' rights.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the Eurogroup of 19 countries using the common currency, stuck to his guns, saying Athens must seek an extension: ""It's really up to the Greeks. We cannot make them or ask them. We stand ready to work with them, also (over) the next couple of days.""Schaeuble and others emphasized the unanimity Greek faced across the table, with some ministers from eastern Europe noting that a minimum wage Tsipras plans to raise is as high as average salaries in some countries where taxpayers funded the bailout.""TROUBLESOME""Some other ministers said the new Greek government did not seem to grasp the gravity of the situation or put forward coherent proposals in writing.""It is troublesome that Greece has twice explained its goals orally, but no written presentation has been given yet,"" said Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne, one of the euro zone hawks.Time is running short and investors marked down Greek stocks and bonds after Monday's debacle, some saying the risk of Greece exiting the euro had risen.Three-year government bond yields rose more than a point to 19 percent, highlighting how far Athens remains unable to fund itself at manageable interest rates on the markets.Dijsselbloem has said Friday is a deadline for a deal that would allow time for some national parliaments to ratify it.A failure of the debt talks could lead to the imposition of capital controls, limiting money withdrawals and transfers, as happened in Cyprus in 2013.Investment bank Barclays said the breakdown of talks had raised the risk that Greece would leave the euro zone and raised the prospect that Tsipras would have to call a referendum on whether to accept a deal with strings or ditch the euro.Chris Scicluna of Daiwa Capital Markets said the failure raised the risk of a ""disorderly conclusion."" But he added: ""All is not lost and we see no need for panic just yet.""

But almost all that growth would go to the richest 1 percent. The rest of us could buy some products cheaper than before. But those gains would be offset by losses of jobs and wages.This is pretty much what ""free trade"" has brought us over the last two decades.I used to believe in trade agreements. That was before the wages of most Americans stagnated and a relative few at the top captured just about all the economic gains.Recent trade agreements have been wins for big corporations and Wall Street, along with their executives and major shareholders. They get better access to foreign markets and billions of consumers.They also get better protection for their intellectual property -- patents, trademarks, and copyrights. And for their overseas factories, equipment, and financial assets.But those deals haven't been wins for most Americans.The fact is, trade agreements are no longer really about trade. Worldwide tariffs are already low. Big American corporations no longer make many products in the United States for export abroad. The biggest things big American corporations sell overseas are ideas, designs, franchises, brands, engineering solutions, instructions, and software.Google, Apple, Uber, Facebook, Walmart, McDonalds, Microsoft, and Pfizer, for example, are making huge profits all over the world.But those profits don't depend on American labor -- apart from a tiny group of managers, designers, and researchers in the U.S.To the extent big American-based corporations any longer make stuff for export, they make most of it abroad and then export it from there, for sale all over the world -- including for sale back here in the United States.The Apple iPhone is assembled in China from components made in Japan, Singapore and a half-dozen other locales. The only things coming from the U.S. are designs and instructions from a handful of engineers and managers in California.Apple even stows most of its profits outside the U.S. so it doesn't have to pay American taxes on them.This is why big American companies are less interested than they once were in opening other countries to goods exported from the United States and made by American workers.They're more interested in making sure other countries don't run off with their patented designs and trademarks. Or restrict where they can put and shift their profits.In fact, today's ""trade agreements"" should really be called ""global corporate agreements"" because they're mostly about protecting the assets and profits of these global corporations rather than increasing American jobs and wages. The deals don't even guard against currency manipulation by other nations.According to Economic Policy Institute, the North American Free Trade Act cost U.S. workers almost 700,000 jobs, thereby pushing down American wages. Since the passage of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, America's trade deficit with Korea has grown more than 80 percent, equivalent to a loss of more than 70,000 additional U.S. jobs.Since China's admission to the World Trade Organization, the U.S. goods trade deficit with China increased $23.9 billion (7.5 percent) to $342.6 billion. Again, the ultimate result has been to keep U.S. wages down. The old-style trade agreements of the 1960s and 1970s increased worldwide demand for products made by American workers, and thereby helped push up American wages.The new-style global corporate agreements mainly enhance corporate and financial profits, and push down wages. That's why big corporations and Wall Street are so enthusiastic about the upcoming Trans Pacific Partnership -- the giant deal among countries responsible for 40 percent of the global economy.That deal would give giant corporations even more patent protection overseas. It would also guard their overseas profits.And it would allow them to challenge any nation's health, safety and environmental laws that stand in the way of their profits -- including our own.The Administration calls the Trans Pacific Partnership a key part of its ""strategy to make U.S. engagement in the Asia-Pacific region a top priority.""Translated: The White House thinks it will help the U.S. contain China's power and influence.But it will make giant U.S. global corporations even more powerful and influential.White House strategists seem to think such corporations are accountable to the U.S. government. Wrong. At most, they're answerable to their shareholders, who demand high share prices whatever that requires. I've seen first-hand how effective Wall Street and big corporations are at wielding influence -- using lobbyists, campaign donations, and subtle promises of future jobs to get the global deals they want. Global deals like the Trans Pacific Partnership will boost the profits of Wall Street and big corporations, and make the richest 1 percent even richer.But they'll bust the rest of America.ROBERT B.

At least 40 million people will likely watch the duo sing at Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony. In other words, a lot of people who never even saw ""Selma"" in theaters will still get to sample the film's message thanks to Common and Legend.""There were many times when I wish I had the opportunity to perform at the Grammys, and I dreamed of being at the Oscars also, but I couldn't pick a better song and movie and co-artist to be able to do this with,"" Common told HuffPost Entertainment in an interview earlier this month. ""This is what I want to do. This is what I dream of doing. I feel like we get the opportunity to have this platform, to deliver a message that's bigger than us and has a higher purpose. That's important.""The Oscar-nominated ""Glory"" acts as an emphatic statement at the end of Ava DuVernay's ""Selma,"" a drama about Martin Luther King Jr.'s march from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama in the name of equal voting rights for all black men and women. But rather than just rehash the history laid out in the film, the song connects ""Selma"" with today's current events.""One son died, his spirit is revisiting us,"" Common raps in the track. ""True and living, living in us. Resistance is us. That's why Rosa sat on the bus. That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up.""""Knowing what we're singing about is inspiring people as they march today in this present time, and knowing millions of people will watch the Oscars is such a huge honor,"" Legend said to HuffPost Entertainment. ""It could not be a better combination of circumstances for us.""Legend and Common worked on the song together -- Legend singing the hook, with Common providing the verses -- but it was DuVernay who pushed them throughout the process. As Common said in his acceptance speech at the Critics Choice Awards in January after ""Glory"" won Best Original Song, the director wanted a track that recalled ""We Are the World."" ""No pressure, right Ava?"" he joked.""Usually when we make songs, if it's a great song, I'm going to keep it on my album,"" Common said. ""But now we have to please the director. So it was fun for me, but then also to have another person be like, 'We need We Are The World.' That drives you to a new level. I enjoyed that.

We were wrongly accused of being anti-police and some even had the audacity to try and say that we somehow created a climate for cops to be shot. Even President Obama and New York City Mayor de Blasio were blamed because they, like us, understood the very real urgency of speaking out in favor of improving relations between the police and the communities they serve. Last week, FBI Director James Comey said virtually the same thing in an unprecedented speech. While I don't agree with everything he said, now that a White Republican leading law enforcement official has called for reform, maybe, just maybe, the message might get through. And today, in an exclusive MSNBC interview just released, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says the following about race: ""People who think you could wave a magic wand and the legacy of the past will be over are blind."" Now that the FBI Director and a sitting Supreme Court judge have spoken, maybe people will stop name-calling and let us deal with the gravity of the issue.A few days ago, officer Peter Liang was indicted in the November shooting death of unarmed Akai Gurley in a dark stairwell of a housing complex in Brooklyn. While we applaud this indictment, it doesn't negate the larger issue: you cannot play Russian roulette to get the right prosecutor. A prosecutor can get an indictment for a police officer that shoots in the dark, but another prosecutor fails to get one for an officer that chokes a person in broad daylight on videotape while that civilian yells ""I can't breathe"" 11 times? The politics of prosecution must be taken out so that we have objectivity and fairness. Our message, like Director Comey's, has always been that not all police are bad -- in fact, most are good. But if we do not hold the bad ones accountable, then we are telling them that they are somehow above the law and that justice exists only for some.""First, all of us in law enforcement must be honest enough to acknowledge that much of our history is not pretty. At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups,"" said Comey during his speech. While he made this and other salient points, Comey made some statements about young men of color, crime and cynicism of police officers that I do not agree with, nor endorse. But his overall message of reforming policing methods in this country, improving relations between communities and law enforcement, and speaking to each other honestly about all of these hard truths must be heard. It doesn't matter who the messenger is, as long as these significant words are received -- especially by those who appear to be tone deaf.Change never happens overnight. As Justice Ginsburg said a magic wand will not solve it. As one who has studied the great teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I can honestly say that it never occurs with one protest, or one boycott. Rather, it is a movement, a concerted push for reform from the ground up. It takes everyone -- from activists in the streets to lawmakers and law enforcement directors -- to highlight our challenges and actively fight for progress. Those on the wrong side of history will always try to attack and demonize people championing what is right. We often forget that even Dr. King wasn't always revered and loved by society; in fact, he was painted as a troublemaker and hated by many. While none of us can ever compare ourselves to the tremendous work he did and the example he set forth, we can try to emulate his dedication to the cause of justice even in the face of the harshest forms of oppression.In the months since the tragic deaths of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Akai Gurley and Tamir Rice, there have been officer-involved killings of many others across this country that simply didn't make the headlines. This is why we cannot rest. While we may not cosign everything Director Comey said, we must acknowledge that this is a moment of advancement and we must seize upon this moment. People are still suffering. People -- not those of us that play various roles in the public space -- but everyday people must be protected. No one should bury a child, mother, father or grandparent because of someone else's bias. And no one should be forced to deal with prosecutors who may have a conflict of interest when going after bad police officers.Peaceful chanting, marching and organizing has brought us to this moment; people are paying attention. Now it is our job to make this renewed attention lead to sustainable results. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter who the messenger is, as long as those that are the hardest to reach can hear it."

Here's 1 Way To Fix That,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/free-breakfast-schools_n_6679430.html,,2015-02-16,"WASHINGTON, DC - MAR 14: Second graders Jaylon Holbrook and Kimberly Perez eat breakfast in their homeroom class at Bancroft Elementary School in Washington, DC, March 14, 2014. The national school breakfast program provides free breakfast to kids in need but at Bancroft where at least 40% of the students qualify for free breakfast, every student receives breakfast. In the last five years, DC leads the nation in terms of growth in participation in this program. (Photo by Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d4ca240000500096e48c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hunger is on the rise among children in the U.S., and though there are systems in place to make sure low-income kids are fed at school, a concerning number of struggling students aren’t eating breakfast.One in five kids relied on food stamps last year, yet nearly half of low-income children didn’t sit down to the most important meal of the day, according to a recent report released by the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC). The organization determined the figures by comparing the number of kids who partook in the free lunch program to those who took advantage of the gratis breakfast option, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of the 21 million kids who received free- or reduced-price lunch last year, only 11.2 million of them ate breakfast, according to FRAC. While that marked a notable increase from the previous year, educators and nonprofit groups have emphasized the urgency to improve those figures. Because even though these children are getting a mid-afternoon meal, educators say they are still at a severe disadvantage.Nine out of 10 teachers say that having a healthy breakfast is critical to achieving academic success, according to nonprofit group Share Our Strength, which connects children in need with nutritious meals through its No Kid Hungry campaign. The same group also concluded that if the number of kids who ate breakfast rose just 20 percentage points, 807,000 more kids would graduate from high school. Often, however, it isn’t a lack of resources that keeps these struggling children from eating in the morning. According to the FRAC report, students often miss the scheduled breakfast period because of long commutes and the fact that already overextended parents can’t get their kids to school any earlier. But some hungry kids are simply ashamed to admit in front of their peers that their families can't afford basic food items. To breakdown these preclusive barriers, nonprofits have partnered with school districts to serve breakfast in the classroom in ways that don’t compel low-income students to stand out from the crowd.Some, for example, have introduced ""grab and go"" carts. Students take a bagged meal from a stocked kiosk or cart that’s parked in the hallway and kids can either eat the meal in a common area or in the classroom during the start of class, according to FRAC. Such simple tweaks in scheduling and serving has already proven to work in a number of districts. Taking breakfast out of the cafeteria and into the classroom in nearly 600 Los Angeles schools has had dramatic results. Since 2011, more than 117,860 additional low-income kids there have participated in the free morning meal program.Schools, like those in Los Angeles, that have improved their breakfast figures are rewarded with additional federal funding. Emboldened by the results, Share Our Strength -- which helped implement the Los Angeles breakfast program -- is working on bringing the concept to other districts in need. The group is currently working to improve the way breakfast is served in New York City schools. While breakfast is available in all schools there, only a quarter of the kids take advantage of the meals, the group said in a press release. ""The seemingly simple act of ensuring that children get school breakfast offers the potential for students to experience greater academic achievement, increased job readiness and ultimately more economic prosperity for our nation,"" Billy Shore, Share Our Strength founder and CEO, said in a statement.Find out more about Share Our Strength and how you can get involved with the organization's efforts here.

The dramatic video, the bloodied office, the manhunt, the hostages, the outrage, the marches, the ubiquitous Je Suis Charlie placards. And then the politicians' pledges, the analysis, the endless commentaries. All right-thinking people lined up in defense of freedom of speech as a cornerstone of liberal democracy. In France, the principles and precepts of their distinctive version of secularism as a political creed and organizing principle for a modern society, laicite, were reaffirmed with ritual fervor. Charlie Hebdo and liberty became synonymous. Few dissented.Are they really synonymous, though? With the flush of emotion receding, the answer is less obvious than it appeared a month ago. Spontaneous unanimity of opinion risks eliding fine discriminations and discourages skeptical questioning. In this instance, the abstract issue of freedom of expression is conflated with judgments as to the probity of the behavior of Charlie Hebdo's managers and cartoonists. It is both logical and reasonable to consider the two separately. It is worth sketching an approach that makes that distinction.First, there is the question of censorship in its legal aspect. Many hold the absolutist position that there should be no governmental imposed restriction on what anyone can say or write - however obnoxious it might be in the eyes of some. In the United States, this represents a tight reading of the First Amendment. In most of Western Europe, the principle is qualified by statute or customary practice. Britain's slander and libel laws are sympathetic to plaintiffs. In Germany among other continental countries, there are explicit prohibitions on the promotion of doctrines and persons associated with Nazism. Hate speech or incitment defined in various terms also is subject to legal penalties in a number of places- including France. The more broadly written the law, the wider the discretion accorded authorities in its implementation. Concern about the possible use of discretionary authority leads some to favor the absolutist position.Second, interpretations of whether either the law or customary practice has been violated are almost never entirely neutral. They are sensitive to historical and political circumstance. Hence, in Europe stricter norms apply to expressions that convey anti-Semitic sentiments than to other groups, religions or topics. In the past, overwhelmingly Catholic countries tended to protect the sensibilities of the Vatican and the Faithful. We would be less than honest if we did not acknowledge that differentiation remains the norm in most of Western Europe - including France and Denmark. This is particularly pronounced in speaking of ""opinion"" as opposed to formal actions by public authorities.The Charlie Hebdo episode confirms that proposition. For there is manifestly greater tolerance among the political class and the public generally for cartoons and captions that have Islam and Muslims as their targets than those that might target Judaism and Jews - with Christians somewhere in between. Had Charlie Hebdo published a steady diet of cartoons deeply offensive to Jews, they would not have been accompanied by the cool, laissez-faire attitude that characterized reaction to their ""Muslim"" caricatures. We should bear in mind, in this regard, that we are not considering a single cartoon as was the case years back with the infamous Danish portrayal of the Prophet Mohammed, but rather several over an extended period of time.What practical meaning does this portrayal of the situation have? The conclusion to be drawn need not be that more legal restrictions are in order. They are risky, contentious and liable to abuse. Voluntary criticism by public figures, media, intellectuals etc. does seem permissible and appropriate. Who decides what's appropriate? Each person and group in accordance with the principle of free expression. Could this generate heavy pressures on somebody or some journal that may have an inhibiting effect? Yes - but that is in the nature of the democratic game. If you dish it out, you have to learn to take it.What of self-censorship? Timothy Garton Ash, in a recent New York Review of Books article, warned sternly about the dangers of intimidation. He had in mind mainly the intimidation represented by the threat of violence. The argument pertains as well to other forms of intimidation. His reasoning pointed to the conviction that we consciously should ignore all and any non-legal restrictions so as to affirm the principle of freedom of speech. One could carry this logic a step further to argue that we are honor bound to publish cartoons and other material that crosses the line into the territory of the offensive as felt by Muslims (not quite Ash's stated position) so as to affirm a basic right. In effect, that is what the Je Suis Charlie slogan did.The alternative would have been to demonstrate under a banner that underscored the principle without associating oneself directly with the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. Apparently, that idea was a non-starter.Consequently, the two issues were merged. School children in France were obliged, under the pain of chastisement, to stand at attention in Je Suis Charlie ceremonies that implicitly linked adherence to the Republic's principles of laicite with the offensive cartoons. The refusal of some to do so was then interpreted as a sign of deficient loyalty to France and a lack of solidarity with its community of values. This is quite dubious logic, though - and not very prudent. Let's try to imagine the Jewish children of recent immigrants being required to do obeisance to a journal that published a long series of vulgar lampoons disparaging Judaism.The stirring of emotions in a thoughtless manner is a dangerous business - whether the stirring is by crude satirists or politicians. Indeed, in the present situation, it might be called ""stupid."" Of course, stupidity is not a crime. At the same time, the encouragement of stupidity can be very costly."

They were forced down onto their knees, then beheaded.A caption on the five-minute video read: ""The people of the cross, followers of the hostile Egyptian church."" Before the killings, one of the militants stood with a knife in his hand and said: ""Safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for.""Thousands of Egyptians desperate for work have traveled to Libya since an uprising at home in 2011, despite advice from their government not to go to a country sliding into lawlessness.Sisi, who met with the country's top military commanders to discuss the killings, called for a seven-day mourning period, state television reported.The Coptic Church said it was confident the government would seek justice. Al Azhar, the center of Islamic learning in Egypt, said no religion would accept such ""barbaric"" acts.The families of the kidnapped workers had urged Cairo to help secure their release. In the mostly impoverished southerly Minya Governorate, relatives screamed and fainted upon hearing news of the deaths.CONCERNS ABOUT LIBYAEgypt, the most populous Arab state, has not taken part directly in the U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, focusing instead on the increasingly complex insurgency within its own borders.Militants based in Libya have made contact with Sinai Province, a group operating from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula that has changed its name from Ansar Beyt al-Maqdis and pledged allegiance to Islamic State.The group has killed hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police since the army toppled Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.With Libya caught in a chaotic power struggle between two rival factions operating their own governments, Western officials worry that Islamist militants are taking advantage of the turmoil to strengthen their presence.A number of Islamist militant groups have been active since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 left Libya without a strong central government. A few have declared ties to the radical Islamic State and claimed high-profile attacks over recent weeks in what appears to be an intensifying campaign.Fears that the crisis in neighboring Libya could spill across the border have prompted Egypt to upgrade its military hardware. French President Francois Hollande has said Egypt will order 24 Rafale fighter jets, a naval frigate and related military equipment in a deal to be signed in Cairo on Monday worth more than 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion).

One person died in an attack at an event promoting freedom of speech and another, a security guard, in the assault at a nearby synagogue.""This wave of attacks and the murderous anti-Semitic assaults that are part of it is expected to go on,"" Netanyahu said at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting, describing the shootings as ""extremist Islamic terrorism.""""Jews deserve protection in every country but we say to Jews, to our brothers and sisters, Israel is your home.

His comments then appeared to upset French leaders as they sought to reassure the shaken Jewish community that it was safe to stay in France. In 2004, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon angered Paris by urging French Jews to flee ""the wildest anti-Semitism"" in their native country and come to Israel. Netanyahu has avoided making such an explicit call for Jews to up and leave.Under Israel's Law of Return, anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent has a right of immigration to Israel and, once there, can receive Israeli citizenship automatically.The cabinet later on Sunday submitted a plan to encourage the absorption of Jews from France, Belgium and Ukraine, and would discuss immigration from other European countries at a later date.

And if you had to place odds right now, the likelihood is that the stubbornness of Europe's senior leaders will create a catastrophe for both Greece and the EU.Here is the state of play. The new Greek leaders, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, spent most of the past two weeks making the case for relaxed terms. They hit a stone wall.Under the current agreement, EU financial institutions spoon-feed loans to Greece, 80 percent of which cycle right out of Greece to pay holders of Greek bonds. Greece itself gets little benefit. In return, Greece is supposed to continue imposing crushing austerity terms. Most onerously, the Greek government is expected to run a ""primary"" budget surplus (excluding interest payments) equal to 4.5 percent of GDP. Greece is also supposed to keep cutting wages.Thanks to this medicine, the Greek economy keeps shrinking and debt as a share of Greek GDP keeps increasing. The policy is madness. But Europe's leaders refuse to relent.The popularity of the new Greek government has soared at home, because Greece finally has leaders willing to take a stand. But will they prevail? Tsipras has already moved to rescind some of the scheduled wage cuts and fire-sale privatizations required by the austerity deal. This enraged Greece's masters in Brussels and Berlin.Europe's leaders have several ways to try to bring the Greeks to heel. Without continued flow of credits under the current austerity deal, Greece doesn't have the funds to pay its debtors. Greek banks also rely on short-term advances from the European Central Bank, which could be cut off it Greece disavows the agreement accepted under duress by previous Greek governments. Some senior European officials also believe that the new policy of massive bond purchases by the European Central Bank of other nations' sovereign debt (""Quantitative Easing"") creates some insulation for the rest of Europe if Greece faces a new crisis. All of this has created an official bullying on the part of Europe's leaders, led by Germany, that matches Greece's own bravado.The crisis will reach a head in the coming days when the ECB decides whether or not to advance Greek banks the next round of cash under the current austerity for debt restructuring deal. If the ECB refuses, Greece will be plunged into a new financial crisis and a deep depression. It's anyone's guess how well such a crisis could be contained to Greece, but these things have a way of rattling financial markets and getting out of hand. Outside of Germany, Europe's own recovery is fragile to say the least.A crisis, at least, would make clear that the current course is unsustainable. Tsipris and Varoufakis are self-described leftists. Varoufakis's academic specialty is game theory and bargaining. Some say his rudeness to Europe's stuffed shirts is carefully calculated. But it's not clear, even to Tsipras and Varoufakis, whether they will subject their long suffering country to deeper economic pain in the hope of ""heightening the contradictions"" and perhaps bluffing their way to a better deal.If such a crisis of insolvency did occur, one outcome could be Greece leaving the euro and returning to the old drachma. Such a move could well be accompanied by mass economic dislocation and deeper suffering -- or the ECB and the IMF could decide to lubricate it with new loans to ease the transition as much as possible.The larger problem is that there is no system of debt restructuring for countries that get into deep economic distress. At home, we have Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. If a corporation can no longer pay its debts, a bankruptcy judge sorts out its assets, decides who gets repaid first, and settles debts at so many cents on the dollar. The corporation can then survive with a fresh start. Investors who put their money into corporate stocks and bonds do so as consenting adults, knowing that they may reap rewards but that they also might not get all of their money back. Bankruptcy has been viewed as a rational way of settling unpayable debts, ever since it was invented 1706 by ministers to Queen Anne.But there is no Chapter 11 for countries. Indebted nations that can't repay creditors find themselves at the tender mercy of ad hoc schemes led by political leaders who usually side with bankers. The deal that was forced on the Greeks in 2010 is one of the worst ever.So the world waits to see who will blink first -- the puritanical Germans who are leading the austerity crusade or the upstart Greeks. In coming days, there will be great political and financial pressure to paper over this crisis with some kind of gesture that would allow the Germans and the ECB to claim that the old deal is being honored, and the Greek leaders to go back to Athens claiming that they negotiated at least token relief. In a way, this would be the worst outcome of all. The austerity bargain is destroying the Greek economy in order to save it. The Greek people have had enough and they've elected a radical government to say so. In this case, the radicals are the bearers of common sense. The austerity deal doesn't need adjusting. It needs to be blown up.Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and a visiting professor at Brandeis University's Heller School.
