1,MEDIA,Jose Antonio Vargas' New Site Aims To Tell Better Story About Race And Identity In America,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jose-antonio-vargas-emergingus-race-identity-media_us_56c489eee4b08ffac1271b5f,"The journalist is trying to raise $500,000 for the project, which will be matched by crowdfunding startup Beacon.",2016-02-18,"After incubating #EmergingUS at the Los Angeles Times, Jose Antonio Vargas hopes the public will buy into his venture.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c4aee11900002a00377da7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jose Antonio Vargas thinks the national media is missing the big picture when it comes to race, culture and immigration in America. As an outspoken journalist, filmmaker and undocumented immigrant, he would like to help tell that story. He just needs a million dollars.On Thursday, Vargas launched a crowdfunding campaign for #EmergingUS, a video-heavy digital media outlet he believes can fill a void in covering thorny, overlapping aspects of American identity. “I cannot talk about Black Lives Matter and not talk about the immigrant rights movement, and not talk about the LGBTQ movement and not talk about income inequality, and not talk about working-class white people,"" Vargas said in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""All of those issues are interconnected, yet for the most part in newsrooms, they’re thought of as separate.”""The way most of the East Coast-based news organizations talk about these issues,"" he added, ""doesn't reflect the reality that is happening across the country.""Vargas, 35, is familiar with East Coast newsrooms. He spent six years at The Washington Post, where he was a member of its Pulitzer Prize-winning team covering the Virginia Tech shooting, worked as a HuffPost editor, and wrote for The New Yorker. His career path took a detour after he revealed in 2011 that he is an undocumented immigrant whose family brought him to the country at 12 years old. Vargas has since toured the country as an immigration activist, landed on the cover of Time magazine, and made documentaries about his own experience and that of young white Americans.Last year, Vargas met with then-Los Angeles Times publisher Austin Beutner, who was looking to reshape the paper and experiment with new digital initiatives. Vargas started #EmergingUS inside the Times newsroom, but after Beutner was fired in September amid clashes with parent company Tribune, Vargas was forced to consider the site's next step forward. Vargas praises the Times for allowing #EmergingUS to incubate in the newsroom, but said the digital platform needed to grow as an independent venture.Vargas is now partnering with Beacon, a crowdfunding startup that's helped raise funds for individual journalists around the world and several news outlets, including this one. Beacon will match donations dollar for dollar up to $500,000, or half of Vargas' total funding target. A $20 donation essentially becomes a $40 pledge. Though crowdfunded journalism is on the rise, a recent Pew study showed this part of the industry remains relatively niche. In the first nine months of 2015, the public gave about $1.7 million to such projects, according to the study. #EmergingUS is looking to bring in $1 million in just 60 days. Vargas said he's ""carefully optimistic"" #EmergingUS will reach its goal because he's confident there's an audience hungry for an outlet with its editorial point of view.""I would argue that there isn’t a digital platform that seeks to answer this question of 'Who are we?' and 'Who are we becoming?'"" Vargas said.#EmergingUS released a trailer to accompany the crowdfunding initiative that highlights several upcoming stories, from Asian male sexuality and Arab-American actors battling stereotypes to the founding of Black Lives Matter and the concerns of the white working class. Vargas, who now lives in LA, said there has been a conversation about race and identity on the West Coast for decades that's extended beyond white and black, and into Latino and Asian populations. He considers that one reason East Coast outlets have appeared slower in tackling emerging demographic and cultural shifts. He also believes major news outlets tend to have coverage blind spots due to lack of diversity in newsroom leadership -- a topic he's recently been tweeting about under the hashtag #JournalismSoWhite‬.Specifically, Vargas said immigration is covered extensively in the U.S. media as a divisive political issue, but often lacks context. He recalled being ""amazed"" at how few facts people knew about immigration when participating in around 470 events throughout the country, including what it means to be undocumented, how one becomes a legal resident, and the makeup of immigrants in the country. Though more than 70 percent of Asian adults in the U.S. are immigrants, he noted, media coverage is primarily focused south of the border. ""Asian people in this country are actually more immigrant than Latinos are,"" he said. ""But how do we cover immigration? Is it because we think Mexican, we automatically think Latino, and then we automatically think the border, and then we automatically think illegal?""Beyond immigration, Vargas said white Americans becoming a racial minority in the coming decades is another big ""untapped, untold story in American journalism right now.""Vargas has expressed views on issues, like immigration, but insists #EmergingUS is journalistic in nature, not advocacy-based. He said journalists are often too hung up on traditional notions of objectivity. “Every story, the way it's told, the way it's edited, the way it's presented -- every story has a point of view,"" he said. ""I grew up in newsrooms. Reporting is my religion. Journalism is my church. Facts are facts, right? When a fire happens, when a murder happens, you cover the facts. But other than that, most everything we report in the media has a point of view.""Vargas added that as a gay, undocumented immigrant, with a Latino name and Asian features, he ""can't really afford objectivity."" Having a point of view, he said, is ""kind of my own way of seeing myself in the way I’m reflected in the media.""He suggested the U.S. media has not lived up to its responsibility to reflect back to the public what a multi-ethnic, contemporary American experience looks like -- something he hopes to do through #EmergingUS. ""We don’t see diversity as a slice of the pie,"" he said. ""For us, it’s the whole pan.”"
2,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Voters Split On Whether Supreme Court Vacancy Should Be Filled This Year,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-vacancy-poll_us_56c5c127e4b08ffac127b80c,The partisan divide among politicians is reflected by the people.,2016-02-18,http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_07/1421506/should_senate_vote_on_scotus_vacancy_this_year-_chartbuilder_c92fc86bcd877bec77148b0027d40834.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.png,http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_07/1421506/should_senate_vote_on_scotus_vacancy_this_year-_chartbuilder_c92fc86bcd877bec77148b0027d40834.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.png,"Americans generally stick to partisan positions when they’re asked about filling Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat. National polls of the GOP primary race are showing healthy variance. And it’s becoming a huge problem for pollsters to ignore cell phones. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, February 18, 2016.AMERICANS ARE SPLIT ON NOMINATING A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE - Anthony Salvanto, Fred Backus, Jennifer De Pinto and Sarah Dutton: “With an unexpected vacancy on the Supreme Court as a result of Justice Antonin Scalia's death, it's unclear if he will be replaced before the November election. Forty-seven percent would like to see the next justice appointed by President Obama before the election in November, while nearly as many, 46 percent, would like to see the new justice appointed by whoever is elected in November. Views are highly partisan: 82 percent of Republicans would like to see the next president appoint Justice Scalia's replacement, while 77 percent of Democrats want President Obama to make that appointment.” [CBS]Voters are equally split on whether the Senate should act on a nomination - Mark Murray: “American voters are divided — especially along party lines — whether the U.S. Senate should vote this year on President Obama's eventual nominee to succeed Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, according to results from a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Among Democratic voters, 81 percent want the Senate to vote this year, while just 9 percent disagree. But those numbers are flipped among Republicans — 81 percent of them want to leave the position vacant, while 11 percent prefer to vote this year. Independents are split — 43 percent this year, 42 percent next year.” [NBC]Knowing the history of Supreme Court nominations makes a difference - Kevin Quealy: ""Americans are divided by political party about whether Mr. Obama should be the one to nominate the replacement, a new online poll shows. But there is also a fascinating wrinkle. The more people are told about the history of Supreme Court nominations, the more they tend to agree that the Senate should consider the president’s nomination, not delay it. Forty-six percent of registered voters said that the next justice should be nominated by the president this year, and 39 percent said the winner of the 2016 presidential election should be the one to put forth a nominee….When given more historical context, respondents were more likely to say the justice should be nominated this year. This new information persuaded Democrats most and independents somewhat less so."" [NYT]CRUZ SURPASSES TRUMP IN NATIONAL POLL, BUT IS HIS LEAD REAL? - HuffPollster: ""The Republican primary may have just shifted in Ted Cruz's favor, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll released Wednesday. The poll, which stands contradictory to other state and national polls, shows the Texas senator 2 percentage points ahead of longtime front-runner Donald Trump. The poll...shows Cruz in first place with 28 percent of the vote to Trump's 26 percent. The results are within the poll's 4.9 percent margin of error. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is in third place with 17 percent…. Republican pollster Bill McInturff...explained to NBC that the results might be an indication that the poll is 'right on top of a shift in the campaign.' That shift, McInturff said, could be a 'momentary 'pause' before the numbers snap back into place,'"" or it could be an enduring change."" [HuffPost] Other national polls show Trump ahead by substantial margins - Four other national polls conducted around the same time as the NBC/WSJ poll all show Trump ahead by margins ranging from 15 to 29 points. The consistency of these polls indicates that the NBC/WSJ poll showing Cruz ahead is likely a statistical outlier -- although the 29-point lead for Trump is probably also an outlier. That doesn’t mean the poll or its methods failed; every pollster will eventually produce an outlier simply because of the uncertainty involved in sampling people. Public pollsters who release these numbers anyway should be commended -- it means they aren’t suppressing information or trying to make their poll look like everyone else’s poll. Of course, the NBC/WSJ numbers could be the correct ones, but since there isn’t a national primary we won’t ever have an election to confirm or refute the numbers. The best option is to go with the averages, which show Trump ahead by a wide margin. [Morning Consult, CBS/Times, Suffolk/USA Today, Quinnipiac]Are we seeing evidence of a ceiling for Trump’s support? - Nate Silver: “There’s a fair bit of evidence that Trump is likely to encounter some upward resistance.….We know he has a high floor. He’s proven it with votes. But he may also have a low-ish ceiling….[T]here’s been a lot of evidence from the start that Trump does underwhelmingly as a second choice….But this is also why it was a good sign for Trump that he got 35 percent of the vote in New Hampshire instead of the 24 percent he got in Iowa. If you’re at 35 percent — well, you don’t need that much more to go from a plurality to an outright majority. At 24 percent, it’s much tougher.” [538]TRUMP LEADS IN SOUTH CAROLINA WITH TWO DAYS UNTIL THE PRIMARY -Republicans will vote on Saturday, and polls show Donald Trump as the most likely winner. According to HuffPost Pollster's aggregate, Trump has a solid 16-point lead over Ted Cruz, 36 percent to 20 percent, with Marco Rubio at 16 percent. All the other candidates are polling in the single digits. Fifty delegates are at stake in the Palmetto State: 26 are awarded to the overall primary winner and the rest are awarded to the candidate who wins each of the state's seven districts.WHY POLLSTERS SHOULDN’T CALL ONLY LANDLINE PHONES - Some pollsters try to lower costs by focusing their efforts on landline telephones rather than calling cell phones, which the Federal Communications Commission requires them to dial by hand. Landlines can be dialed more cheaply, and pollsters can use automated voice technology on landlines to avoid the expense of interviewers. The FCC bans automated polls on cell phones. But pollsters who rely primarily on landline phone calls without taking alternate steps to reach cell phone users are missing larger and larger segments of the population. Updated estimates of wireless-only households finds that the majority of adults in 11 states live in households that only use cell phones. When ""wireless only"" and ""wireless mostly” -- defined as answering most calls on a cell phone -- households s are combined, just seven states fall below the 50 percent threshold.

He said the hospital notified law enforcement and computer experts worked feverishly to restore system access and uncover the source.The origin of the computer network intrusion remains unknown but it bogged down communications between physicians and medical staff who suddenly became had to rely on paper records and doctors' notoriously messy handwriting, according to doctors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Although the cyber attack snarled the hospital's patient database, doctors managed to relay necessary medical records the old-fashioned way through phone lines and fax machines, said Dr. Rangasamy Ramanathan, a neonatal-perinatal specialist affiliated with the 434-bed facility.The FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department are working to pinpoint the hacker or hackers responsible for the intrusion, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said on Wednesday."
4,POLITICS,Shady Spanish-Language Robocall Claims Marco Rubio Supports 'Amnesty',Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-spanish-robocall-amnesty_us_56c5dbc8e4b0b40245c93368,The recording also conspicuously praises Sen.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for supporting ""amnesty"" for undocumented immigrants just two days out from the critical South Carolina presidential primary.The audio recording of the call was passed along to The Huffington Post by a resident of South Carolina who wished to remain anonymous. In the recording, a woman speaking in Spanish accuses Rubio, who on Wednesday picked up the coveted endorsement of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R), of supporting ""amnesty"" in contrast to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who is described in the call as opposing the idea.""Ted Cruz knows that those of us who followed the rules are tired of taking a back seat to those who cut in line,"" the woman says in Spanish on the recording.The speaker emphasizes three phrases in particular -- ""Marco Rubio,"" ""amnesty"" and ""illegally.""Listen to the call below:If a Spanish-only robocall sounds peculiar in a state like South Carolina, where there are few residents who speak only Spanish -- and even fewer who speak only Spanish and vote in a Republican primary -- that's because it is. The recording is most likely an effort to make non-Spanish-speaking voters believe that Rubio is calling Hispanics and promising amnesty -- something that would make Rubio wildly unpopular among the many GOP voters who support building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.Rubio did once support a Senate bill to grant undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship, but he has since disavowed the legislation, saying the U.S. first ought to secure the border.Alex Burgos, a spokesman for the Rubio campaign, said in a statement Thursday that Cruz's campaign ""has now gone bilingual with their false dirty tricks. But it's yet another dirty trick that South Carolinians will see right through.""A spokeswoman for Cruz's presidential campaign did not immediately return a request for more information about the recording.The robocall follows a moment in last Saturday's Republican presidential debate in which Rubio challenged Cruz's ability to speak Spanish. The Texas senator took him up on it, but the results were underwhelming.The call also comes amid escalating attacks between the two men over what many view as underhanded tactics in the Palmetto State. Rubio's campaign earlier this week accused Cruz of using “dishonest push-polls” to attack the Florida senator. “This has been a pattern now with Ted,"" Rubio said Tuesday. ""He has spent the last two weeks literally just making stuff up.""Cruz returned fire on Wednesday, accusing Rubio of behaving in ""disturbing” ways on the campaign trail.UPDATE: 2:30 p.m. -- Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Cruz, told HuffPost on Thursday that the senator's campaign was not behind the robocall.Liz Martinez contributed to this report.This story has been updated with comments from the Rubio and Cruz campaigns.Also on HuffPost:"

Paul LePage (R) on Thursday suggested he would favor President Barack Obama nominating someone to the open Supreme Court seat, becoming the latest Republican to say so in the days following Justice Antonin Scalia’s sudden death.“I'm a big constitutionalist,” LePage told the Maine Sun-Journal. “If it's in the Constitution, I think it means something.”LePage, who was first elected in 2010 as part of a tea party wave, is not the Republican official one might expect to part ways with the Republican leadership.He elicited controversy in January for suggesting that Maine residents deal with the state’s drug abuse problem by shooting drug dealers. A few weeks before, he used racially loaded language and imaginary names like ""D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty"" to describe those drug dealers.LePage’s view is consistent with Maine Republicans' independent streak, however. Susan Collins, Maine's Republican senator, has said she would give ""careful consideration"" to any Obama nominee in accordance with her constitutional duties. The governor's remarks are unlikely to make much of a difference in the nomination process one way or another, something he freely conceded.""I have no clue what the federal government is going to do and I have no clue what the state legislature is going to do, so I don't even worry about it,"" LePage remarked. It is up to the Republican-controlled Senate to consider and approve a president’s Supreme Court nominations, and GOP senators -- aside from some prominent exceptions -- have opposed the notion of even considering an Obama nominee.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) has ruled out the possibility of seating a Supreme Court nominee until the next president takes office.Also on HuffPost:"

""They have attacked him for everything from the color of suit he wears, to the Affordable Care Act -- which they were for at one time.""GOP senators, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have said they won't even consider any nominee put forward by Obama because they want to let the next White House occupant choose -- hoping, of course, that a Republican wins the presidential election. Democrats, however, have hit back hard, publicly shaming Republicans for declaring their intent to obstruct in advance. And a few Republicans have started to break from the party line and say they'd be willing to vote on a nominee. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also implied that racism was in play this week, saying that Republicans are making statements about Obama as if ""he wasn't a real president.""""Many Republicans talk in coded racial language about takers and losers. They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe,” Clinton said at the Schomberg Center for Research in Black Culture earlier this week in Harlem. “This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our country.”UPDATE: Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) sidestepped a Huffington Post question Friday about whether the congressman agrees with his colleagues about the racially motivated GOP opposition, instead saying the Republican Party was ""derelict"" in its duty. Clyburn's comments came during an event Friday at Allen University in South Carolina, where he was endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.Eliot Nelson contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost: "

Overall, 43 percent of black voters are confident in Sanders compared with 73 percent who are confident in Clinton. A larger portion of black voters have arrived at a decision on how well Sanders would address the concerns of African-Americans since a November Monmouth poll. Fourteen percent of black voters now say Sanders would do an excellent job -- up 6 points since November -- and 29 percent think he would do a good job -- down 3 points. That’s an overall improvement of 3 points.Thirty-four percent say Sanders would do an ""only fair"" job -- up 2 points since November -- and 11 percent say he would do a poor job -- a 4-point increase. Comparatively, black voters continue to place a great deal of faith in Clinton and her ability to meet the needs of African-Americans. Three in 10 black voters say she'd do an excellent job while over 4 in 10 say she'd do a good job. Twenty-two percent think she'd perform an ""only fair"" job and just 1 percent say she'd do a poor job. African-Americans make up about 30 percent of the population in South Carolina and are projected to make up a majority of voters in the state's Feb. 27 Democratic primary. They account for 52 percent of the Democratic respondents in the poll. In 2008, 55 percent of Democrats that voted in South Carolina were black. South Carolina is not the only state in which Sanders has failed to make headway with black voters. A recent national survey of 1,100 African-Americans finds that 58 percent give Sanders a positive rating while 72 do so for Clinton. In addition, while millennials have largely been reported as Sanders supporters, this survey finds that black millennials are more favorable of Clinton.Monmouth surveyed 403 likely Democratic voters in South Carolina Feb. 14-16.Also on HuffPost:"

In response, anti-government groups and other supporters rallied to Bundy's defense.Following an armed standoff, the federal agents ultimately backed down, citing safety concerns and returned the cattle they had seized.""Persons who use force and violence against federal law enforcement officers who are enforcing court orders, and nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others, will be brought to justice,"" U.S. Attorney Daniel Bogden said in the statement.An attorney for Bundy could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday night.Bundy was arrested earlier this month in Portland, Oregon where his sons Ammon and Ryan Bundy were being held after their arrests for leading a separate armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in the community of Burns.Both Ammon and Ryan were also charged for participating in the Nevada standoff, along with Ryan Payne and Peter Santilli, according to the statement.All were charged with conspiracy, carrying a firearm in relation to a violent crime, obstruction of justice, extortion, and assault and threats against federal law enforcement.The charge of assault on a federal law enforcement officer carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. If convicted, the defendants would also have to forfeit at least $3 million worth of property secured through the crimes, the statement said.Related On HuffPost:"
13,PARENTS,This Author Thinks He Knows How To Stop Kids From Hating School,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nikhil-goyal-schools_us_56c4cd0de4b0b40245c8c06e,"Nikhil Goyal says most schools turn kids into ""docile, passive adults"" who lack critical thinking skills.",2016-02-18,"Nikhil Goyal, author of <em>Schools on Trial: How Freedom and Creativity Can Fix Our Educational Malpractice.</em>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c4fe661900002a00377e21.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When 20-year-old Nikhil Goyal recalls his experience at a large, high-achieving public high school, he makes it sound more like a prison than an institution designed to foster learning and creativity. He describes listless teens who shuffled robotically between classes, anxious perfectionists who self-medicated with prescription drugs, and frustrated students for whom the system simply did not work. He remembers little joy, curiosity or innovation. After graduating, Goyal decided to travel the country in an attempt to figure out what type of school he thinks would work for students. He said he did find some answers, but the schools he envisions look pretty different from those serving most kids today. Goyal documents his research in a new book, Schools on Trial: How Freedom and Creativity Can Fix Our Educational Malpractice. He looks to progressive, democratic schools -- both public and private -- in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, as models of what's possible. These schools encourage students to take control of their educational experiences, design their own curriculum and play as much as possible. They create happy environments, where bullying is virtually non-existent, Goyal writes. We spoke with Goyal to learn more about his book and what he thinks about the current public school system. Tell us about your high school experience and why it made you want to write this book.I graduated from Syosset High School on Long Island. It's a pretty affluent, high-ranking district, and a lot of students go on to attend Ivy League institutions. It's pretty much the ideal school district on paper.Many students had severe mental health issues, maybe depression and anxiety, suicidal thoughts, prescription drug usage. For most of the kids in the honors or AP classes, their primary goal in high school was to do whatever they could to make their college application as attractive as possible. They only took classes and got involved with extracurricular activities to pad their resumes. But they were sacrificing a lot of their happiness, sleep and mental health.There's something much more to life than simply participating in that rat race.How did you experience high school?I was somebody who really did not like school. I found it to be very disengaging, boring, and irrelevant to what I was most interested in, which was politics and foreign affairs. There was little of that happening -- at least in the school day.Some of the most meaningful activities in high school occurred after school, when I was participating in the speech and debate team or model U.N. team. That’s where I found most of my friends. I thought: What if those experiences actually dominated high school? What if those self-directed, project-based, hands-on experiences that were part of my after-school programs were actually the school day?I began to do research on this topic. I began interviewing people and policymakers and found these progressive schools and called them up and asked if I could visit.What surprised you most about these progressive schools?I think what surprised me the most is how many of these schools are in existence and how few people know about them. In the book, I chart out a history of the progressive school movement and how many of these ideas were implemented, endorsed and debated rigorously in the 1960s and '70s. This was an era for protest, with the feminist movement and civil rights movement, but one of the overlooked movements is something called the free school movement. You had education writers indicting the traditional school system, saying it crushes creativity.If you read those books, they will still be relevant for today's education system. Very little has changed. The structures of American schooling has largely remained the same for decades.I think there is a lot of discomfort and frustration with the current education system. There is a movement away from standardized tests.What kind of adults are schools today creating?I think they're creating docile, passive adults who largely are not capable of complex, critical thinking.I think they generally create people who fit into the social order and don’t look to destruct it as much. It's very rare for kids to come out of school with a lot of their imagination and curiosity intact.How do we create a society in which a majority of students are able to attend these schools?Practically speaking, one of the things we could do is start pilot programs with these kinds of models in districts around the country. We could look at the charter school movement -- which has unfortunately veered away from its original purpose to create innovation in the public system -- and create these islands of innovation. We should have publicly funded schools that have flexibility in terms of their standards, curriculum and testing requirements.There's a lot of evidence showing that private schools are very effective, but many of these schools contain a population that is more affluent, white and privileged. I think we need to test this much more in communities of color. Even though there are some progressive schools in those communities, we need more.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.______Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation, and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

In fact, many were recommended to the White House by GOP senators. It's just that Republicans don't want Obama to put his judicial picks on courts. They'd rather punt all confirmations until 2017, when there might be a GOP president who would put forward nominees more to their liking.In the meantime, court vacancies are rising, cases are being delayed for years on end and judges are burning out trying to keep up.Obama on Tuesday noted the parallels between Republicans threatening to derail his Supreme Court nominee -- he hasn't even announced his pick yet -- and the attitude they've taken toward his other judicial picks.""In some ways, this argument is just an extension of what we've seen in the Senate generally,"" he said. ""We've almost grown accustomed to a situation that is almost unprecedented, where every nomination is contested.

In other words, lots of sitting around that doesn't actually need to happen.In some cases, the same GOP senator who originally recommended a judicial nominee to Obama is now the one holding up the process. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), for example, recommended Florida district court nominee Mary Flores to the White House. She was nominated in February 2015, but hasn't moved since. That's because Rubio won't turn in his so-called ""blue slip"" to the Judiciary Committee. The blue slip signals that a home-state senator is ready to move forward with his or her nominee. Without that slip, the committee chairman won't give a nominee a hearing.Flores' other senator, Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), turned in his blue slip months ago. If Rubio ever relents and turns in his slip, Flores would be on track to fill a court seat that's been empty for 644 days. That seat is also considered a judicial emergency, meaning its judges have more than 600 cases, or between 430 and 600 cases for over 18 months -- a totally unmanageable workload.To be fair, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did agree to move a package of five judicial nominees earlier this year, and all have been confirmed.

It was the second execution this week in the United States and the seventh of the year.Hittson received the death penalty for the April 1992 murder of 20-year-old Conway Utterbeck during a weekend leave from the USS Forrestal aircraft carrier.Hittson shot Utterbeck following a night of drinking while on a trip to central Georgia to visit the parents of a third sailor on the ship, Edward Vollmer, according to court records.“I had no emotion or nothing on my face, I know I didn’t,"" Hittson later told police in his confession to the killing, court records showed.He shot Utterbeck in the forehead and then went out to eat at a nearby Waffle House. Afterward, Hittson and Vollmer dismembered his body, using a kitchen steak knife and a hacksaw, according to court records.They buried Utterbeck's torso in a shallow grave in the woods. The men put his severed hands, head and feet in the trunk of Vollmer’s car and returned to the ship based in Pensacola, Florida, on Monday morning, court records showed.After getting off work that day, they discarded his remaining body parts in the Florida Panhandle, records said.The Georgia Department of Corrections said Hittson accepted a final prayer and recorded a final statement, which the agency did not release.The Georgia Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday both denied Hittson's requests to stay the execution.His lawyers also unsuccessfully appealed to the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute his sentence to life without parole, a sentence not available during his 1993 trial. The state board denied his request on Tuesday.Vollmer told Hittson that Utterbeck was plotting to kill the two of them, according to court records. But there was no evidence that Utterbeck intended to harm them. Hittson later described Vollmer as ""very paranoid.""Vollmer made a plea deal with prosecutors and was sentenced to life in prison, with eligibility for parole. He was denied parole last year.

We will be reinforcing our protocols with every member of our animal care staff to prevent an incident like this from ever happening again.”This isn’t the first time that an animal at the Calgary Zoo has died as a result of human error. In 2012, a great grey owl was killed after it flew into a gate while being transported, apparently due to a lack of planning and communication between two zoo employees. And in 2009, a female capybara was crushed in a hydraulic door after a staffer did not follow proper protocol. The employee was suspended for two days after the incident.There have also been several other dangerous occurrences at the zoo over the years, CBC News noted, including a knife-brandishing gorilla (a keeper accidentally left the weapon in the enclosure) and a pool-full of dead stingray after oxygen levels dipped to dangerous levels in the exhibit.

It's a technology U.N. Refugee Agency representative Andrew Harper said brings several advantages.""Refugees use their irises as a form of identification, so this makes it fraud proof,"" Harper said in a statement.Tuesday's launch simply expands the existing technology to include the World Food Program. Once the shopper has their iris scanned, the system automatically communicates with UNHCR’s registration database to confirm their identity, before determining the person's remaining balance, WFP said in a release.“Sometimes, just like anyone, refugees would forget their PIN numbers or misplace their cards,” Dina El-Kassaby, regional communications officer for WFP, told Mashable. “Or they would leave the country and leave the card behind. In some cases, cards would be stolen or misused. This iris scan technology just cuts all that out.”WFP says that in the coming months it is looking to expand the use of the technology to all Syrian refugee camps in Jordan. While biometric scanning has its advantages, some, including Jonathan Shannon, a professor and cultural anthropologist at Hunter College in New York City, say it pushes the line between identification and surveillance.""My main concerns ... is that the technology is merely a backdoor for attempting to monitor and control majority Muslim populations and tracking them in Europe,"" Shannon told CNBC.Today, there are more than 660,000 refugees living in Jordan, according to the U.N.Also on HuffPost: "

However, the pope stopped short of condoning abortion. “Avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil,” Francis said, according to multiple reports. “In certain cases, as in this one... it was clear. I would also urge doctors to do their utmost to find vaccines against these mosquitoes that carry this disease.”Francis ruled out abortion, however, calling it “a crime, an absolute evil.”The Catholic church generally opposes contraception. Francis referenced an exception Pope Paul VI made in the 1960s allowing nuns in the Belgian Congo to take birth control pills because they were in danger of being raped. And in 2010, Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict, made waves when he suggested that using condoms might be morally justifiable as a way to prevent the spread of HIV. While mosquitoes are the main mode of transmission for the disease, the Zika virus can remain in semen for an indeterminate amount of time. A handful of case studies in the U.S. suggest that the disease can be transmitted sexually.Because of this, authorities from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that pregnant couples who may have been exposed to Zika use condoms consistently and correctly to make sure the virus is not passed along to the expectant mother.Several countries affected by the epidemic have advised women to delay pregnancy, which may present some difficulty in heavily Catholic areas.Thirty countries and territories have ongoing Zika virus transmission right now. Brazil is home to the largest Zika virus epidemic by far. An estimated 498,000 to 1.5 million Brazilians may have contracted the disease, which is symptomless for most people who get it.Brazil's Zika epidemic, which may have begun as early as 2014, appears to coincide with a spike of microcephaly, in which babies are born with smaller heads than normal. The country's ministry of health reported 4,443 suspected or confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil in its last update.Because of Zika's suspected link to microcephaly, as well as a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, the World Health Organization declared the clusters of birth defects potentially linked to the virus a ""public health emergency of international concern"" on Feb. 1.This is a developing story.

At points, his message seemed to taunt the Feds. McAfee, who's running for president as a Libertarian, said the FBI hit this impasse because it only hires straight-laced computer experts who are less talented than his ""prodigies.""""And why do the best hackers on the planet not work for the FBI?

The product allowed kids to create their own creepy crawlers, mini dragons and flowers by pouring hot plastic into molds. Now, the revamped ThingMaker, which costs $299.99, slingshots that concept into the 21 century by enabling kids (and OK, adults, too) to tinker with toy designs that span from figurines to jewelry on an easy-to-use app on their tablets or phones before they print their creations on the printer.Mattel partnered with software company Autodesk with the aim of creating a fast, easy-to-use app that won’t crash like other kids’ toys apps do, according to Toyland. Because the app was outsourced to Autodesk -- which has shown an interest in fostering kids’ love for design in the past -- it can also be used on other 3-D printers. Toyland also reports that ThingMaker Design app comes pre-loaded with blueprints for scorpions, skeletons, rings and necklaces. Taking a gander at ThingMaker’s site, it appears that unicorns, dolls, robots and dinosaurs are also available. The toys are printed in batches, according to USA Today, or parts with ball-and-socket joints, that need to be assembled after printing. This means that toys that are already printed can be modified and updated, as well.As a safety mechanism, the door of the printer automatically locks when printing starts, according to USA Today. Toyland reports toys printed from the system are rated safe for children age 3 and up, and a heated printing head retracts when the printer is not in use, so kids don’t try to touch it and get burnt.Mattel hasn’t released any information on how much PLA plastic filament, which is the material most commonly used for 3-D printing today, will cost. But USA Today, notes that spools online cost about $23. There are also questions as to whether or not Mattel will release blueprints for some of their most popular toys like Barbie and Hot Wheels and how many filament colors will be offered. Toyland said there were about two dozen colors at Mattel’s table at the trade show, but a spokesperson told them that Mattel intends to offer a lot.There are also no definitive answers as to whether one will be able to print the new curvy, petite and tall Barbies on a 3-D printer just yet.There are kinks to work out in regards of how long it takes for toys to print. According to USA Today, a ring can take 30 minutes while larger toys can take up to six to eight hours. Also on HuffPost:"

More than 90 percent of people in those states are white.Clinton met for more than two hours on Tuesday with a half-dozen civil rights leaders at the New York headquarters of the National Urban League.""I thought that the secretary demonstrated an ease and familiarity with many of the issues we discussed this morning,"" National Urban League President Marc Morial said afterward.The Rev. Al Sharpton joked with Clinton in the corridors afterward, suggesting to reporters he had told her which candidate he would endorse.""My lips are sealed!"" Clinton, who did not take any media questions, replied with a smile.At a news conference later, Sharpton said Clinton was ""candid and open,"" but he added he had yet to decide who to support and that no candidate should take the support of black voters for granted. ""We are not a monolithic people,"" he said.Clinton's campaign team has argued that Sanders' growing support among Democrats will likely falter as voting for a party nominee moves to more racially diverse states in the coming weeks.Both Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have traditionally had solid support from blacks, a key component of the Democratic electorate.Opinion polls show Clinton with a strong lead over Sanders in South Carolina, where blacks are likely to make up more than half the voters in the state's Democratic primary on Feb. 27.Sanders has said Clinton's polling lead among blacks is partly a result of her being more famous than he is. He believes many non-white voters will be drawn to his message of fighting economic inequality as they get to know him.He is scheduled to meet with civil rights leaders in Washington on Thursday.SPEECH IN HARLEMLater on Tuesday, Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York, gave a speech in the historically black New York City neighborhood of Harlem on breaking down the barriers that black families face. She was joined onstage before her remarks by New York Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Eric Holder, the first black U.S. attorney general.""There are still very real barriers holding back African-Americans from fully participating in our economy and our society,"" Clinton said, citing disparities between blacks and whites in earnings, health and criminal sentencing.She said that if elected, she would spend $2 billion to encourage public school districts with a high number of troubled students to hire social workers and other experts to help young people before they get entangled in the criminal justice system.Sanders, who frequently decries the country's high incarceration rate, also met with Sharpton earlier this month, and was endorsed by Benjamin Jealous, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who said he could not support Clinton in part because of her support of the death penalty.Clinton was endorsed last week by the Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee, which said Clinton had a long history of working on issues that affect black Americans.(Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Frances Kerry and Peter Cooney)Also on HuffPost:"

More than 90 percent of people in those states are white.Clinton met for more than two hours on Tuesday with a half-dozen civil rights leaders at the New York headquarters of the National Urban League.""I thought that the secretary demonstrated an ease and familiarity with many of the issues we discussed this morning,"" National Urban League President Marc Morial said afterward.The Rev. Al Sharpton joked with Clinton in the corridors afterward, suggesting to reporters he had told her which candidate he would endorse.""My lips are sealed!"" Clinton, who did not take any media questions, replied with a smile.At a news conference later, Sharpton said Clinton was ""candid and open,"" but he added he had yet to decide who to support and that no candidate should take the support of black voters for granted. ""We are not a monolithic people,"" he said.Clinton's campaign team has argued that Sanders' growing support among Democrats will likely falter as voting for a party nominee moves to more racially diverse states in the coming weeks.Both Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have traditionally had solid support from blacks, a key component of the Democratic electorate.Opinion polls show Clinton with a strong lead over Sanders in South Carolina, where blacks are likely to make up more than half the voters in the state's Democratic primary on Feb. 27.Sanders has said Clinton's polling lead among blacks is partly a result of her being more famous than he is. He believes many non-white voters will be drawn to his message of fighting economic inequality as they get to know him.He is scheduled to meet with civil rights leaders in Washington on Thursday.SPEECH IN HARLEMLater on Tuesday, Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York, gave a speech in the historically black New York City neighborhood of Harlem on breaking down the barriers that black families face. She was joined onstage before her remarks by New York Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Eric Holder, the first black U.S. attorney general.""There are still very real barriers holding back African-Americans from fully participating in our economy and our society,"" Clinton said, citing disparities between blacks and whites in earnings, health and criminal sentencing.She said that if elected, she would spend $2 billion to encourage public school districts with a high number of troubled students to hire social workers and other experts to help young people before they get entangled in the criminal justice system.Sanders, who frequently decries the country's high incarceration rate, also met with Sharpton earlier this month, and was endorsed by Benjamin Jealous, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who said he could not support Clinton in part because of her support of the death penalty.Clinton was endorsed last week by the Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee, which said Clinton had a long history of working on issues that affect black Americans.(Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Frances Kerry and Peter Cooney)Also on HuffPost:"

Bush’s policies kept us safe. New polls in Nevada show a runaway race on the GOP side, but a near-tie for Democrats. And Hillary Clinton’s strengths might not be as important as it seems. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, February 17, 2016.VOTERS SPLIT ON WHETHER BUSH KEPT AMERICANS SAFE - Morning Consult “In our new national poll, 34 percent of respondents said [President George W.] Bush’s policies kept us safer, while 35 percent said he kept us less safe. Twenty percent of voters said they didn’t think his policies made any impact….And along partisan lines, 57 percent of Republicans said Bush kept us safer, compared to only 19 percent of Democrats. Independents were split on the question: 30 percent said Bush’s policies kept us safe and 32 percent said we were less safe because of them. [Morning Consult]Trump supporters less likely to think Bush kept us safe - More from Morning Consult: “[Donald] Trump was booed audibly for implying that George W. Bush didn’t keep us safe because of the Sept. 11 attacks, and our polling shows his supporters are much more likely to agree with him than other candidates. Twenty-two percent of Trump supporters say Bush’s policies kept us less safe, compared with just 6 percent of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s supporters and 8 percent of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s supporters.” [Morning Consult]NEW CNN/ORC POLL SHOWS TRUMP WITH A MASSIVE LEAD IN NEVADA - Jennifer Agiesta: “The poll finds businessman Donald Trump holding a wide lead, topping the field with the support of 45 percent of those likely to caucus. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz are closely matched in the race for second place, with Rubio at 19 percent and Cruz at 17 percent. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson (7 percent), Ohio Gov. John Kasich (5 percent) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (1 percent) lag well behind those three. Nearly 6-in-10 likely GOP caucusgoers say they have definitely decided whom to support, with about one-quarter still trying to make up their minds...Trump is also widely seen as most likely to change the way things work in Washington (64 percent say he's best on that measure), and as the candidate with the best chance of winning in November (56 percent say Trump has the best shot)."" [CNN]CLINTON AND SANDERS TIED IN NEVADA - More from Agiesta: “Likely Democratic caucusgoers in Nevada are split almost evenly between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders ahead of Saturday's caucuses....Overall, 48 percent of likely caucus attendees say they support Clinton, 47 percent Sanders. Both candidates carry their demographic strong points from prior states into Nevada, with Clinton holding an edge among women, while Sanders tops the former secretary of state among voters under age 55. One exception emerges though: Although the pool of potential caucusgoers in Nevada is more racially diverse than those who participated in Iowa or New Hampshire, the racial divide among likely caucusgoers isn't nearly as stark as among voters in South Carolina, with both white and non-white voters about evenly divided between the two candidates.” [CNN]What to watch for in Nevada - Jon Ralston: ""It all comes down to turnout...Most folks I trust on the ground don’t expect turnout to reach six figures again – one insider estimated 70,000 voters. The lower it is, the better for Clinton….If the caucus were just about the current universe of voters, it would be easier to predict and would lean even more toward Clinton. But that is not how it works as the Democrats allow same-day registration….Both campaigns are now calling independents and telling them they can switch to the Democratic Party on Saturday and participate. But how many will do so?...If the turnout is, as the silly Team Clinton spin asserted, 80 percent white, she will lose….Clinton has much more to lose here than Sanders."" [Reno Gazette Journal] CLINTON'S FOREIGN POLICY STRENGTH MAY NOT BE MUCH OF AN ADVANTAGE - HuffPollster: ""There's a reason Clinton stresses her foreign policy bona fides: in a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 59 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say she'd do a very good job of handling foreign policy as president. Just 23 percent say the same of her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I). But while she holds a significant advantage on the issue, it may prove to be less of an electoral edge than she hopes….[T]he drumbeat of Sanders' attacks seems to be having an effect on some aspects of Clinton's economic credibility….[S]he's still viewed as more likely than not to stand up to Wall Street. But the share of likely Democratic primary voters who think she'd capitulate has risen to 37 percent, compared to just 12 percent who say the same of Sanders."" [HuffPost] CLINTON BETTER-LIKED AMONG BLACK VOTERS BUT SANDERS HAS ROOM TO GROW - Frank Newport: ""Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are actively pursuing the votes of black Democratic caucus and primary voters in Nevada and the key Southern state of South Carolina….Black voters are crucial for Clinton, given that she has a relative image problem among white Democrats. Sanders has a relative image problem among black Democrats nationwide, although some of that is based on the fact that about a third of them do not know him….The two Democratic candidates are also competing for Hispanic voters. This is particularly relevant in Nevada, where Hispanics make up a little less than 28% of the population, although less so in South Carolina, where Hispanics are 5% of the population. Sanders actually has an image advantage over Clinton among Hispanic Democrats in some ways, although he is again deeply handicapped by his lack of name recognition. [Gallup] MILLENNIALS ARE JUST AS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE AS PAST GENERATIONS WERE - Samantha Smith: ""[Millennials] are the least confident about the nation’s future, just like Generation Xers and Baby Boomers when they were young…. just 37% of Millennials said they had 'quite a lot of confidence' in the future of the United States, compared with 45% of Gen Xers, 49% of Boomers and 56% of the Silent Generation….. In 1994, just 30% of Gen Xers said they had quite a lot of confidence in the future of the U.S. Among older generations at the time – Boomers and Silents – half or more had a lot of confidence in the nation’s future…. In 1975, when Boomers were the youngest generation, 49% had a great deal of confidence in the future of the U.S., compared with 62% of Silents and 67% of the Greatest Generation.""

Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are rehashing what happened when a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill failed in the Senate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c4d9d71900002900377df1.jpeg?cache=HFNjREOgUo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As they fight for the Latino vote in Nevada and elsewhere, the Clinton and Sanders campaigns are sparring over an immigration reform vote that took place nine years ago.To hear former Secretary of State and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton tell it, the matter is uncomplicated: She and then-Sen. Barack Obama supported the bill, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) did not.That is true of the final vote for the 2007 bill led by then-Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), which would have allowed undocumented immigrants to gain legal status, created a temporary worker program and strengthened border security and enforcement against employers who hired unauthorized workers.""I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done,"" Clinton said at the most recent Democratic debate. ""And I was proud to stand with him and support it.""Along the way, though, she and Obama didn't always stand with Kennedy, and how the legislation died is more complicated than just the final vote. The bill began its tortured march toward death when most Democrats -- including Clinton, Obama and Sanders -- went against Kennedy and supported an amendment that changed the legislation's guest-worker provisions.The addition was referred to at the time as what's known on the Hill as a ""poison pill"" -- an unpalatable provision tacked onto a bill that is intended to kill it. The amendment Obama, Clinton and Sanders succeeded in adding threatened the bill's Republican and business support; Kennedy warned at the time that a vote for it would kill immigration reform.It's not insignificant that Sanders opposed the 2007 immigration bill and Clinton supported it. Still, her frequent mentions of his vote, without mentioning her own role in the poison pill amendment, are a diversion, the Sanders campaign argued. ""The Hillary campaign keeps trying to divert attention from their non-existent plan and keeps pointing to 2007 when she in fact voted for the poison pill,"" said Arturo Carmona, national deputy political director for the Sanders campaign. ""It's totally hypocritical.""The Clinton campaign argued that the final vote, not the amendments, is what counts. “The difference between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is that Hillary Clinton voted for Senator Kennedy’s immigration reform bill in 2007 and Senator Sanders voted against it,"" spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in an email.It's impossible to say whether the amendment truly killed the legislation -- given heavy GOP opposition to the entire bill, it's possible that it would have died regardless of the measure, which was sponsored by Democrat Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. Supporters of the amendment have said their goal was to improve the bill, not to kill its chances.But supporters of the bill certainly thought at the time that the Dorgan amendment was a damaging one. Then-Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who was part of the immigration reform negotiations, knocked fellow Republican Jim DeMint in 2007 for voting ""for the amendment to kill the bill,"" calling it ""a poison pill.""After hearing that Obama would support the amendment, one lobbyist quipped while watching it on C-SPAN, ""'Presidential candidate kills immigration bill' -- there's a headline for you."" That comment from lobbyist Craig Silvertooth, who was working with the pro-reform and business-allied Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, was captured in the documentary ""Last Best Chance."" Not all supporters agree on that point. America's Voice Director Frank Sharry, a longtime advocate also involved in the 2007 effort, said the idea that Obama and others wanted to sink the bill so they could use it politically was a ""meme [the right] seized on for years to try to cover up for their own inability to muster support for a conservative Bush WH-drafted version of comprehensive reform."" Sharry said advocates ""gave a green light to"" the vote as a tactical move: Democrats would approve the amendment, and then later agree to drop it in exchange for also dropping another amendment they opposed. ""The ship finally went down, but not because of the Dorgan amendment, but because a conservative bill couldn't attract enough R votes,"" Sharry said in an email. Sanders has consistently defended his vote against the bill, even as he seeks to bolster his pro-immigrant credentials. He defended the vote at last week's Democratic debate, after Clinton talked up her support for the 2007 immigration reform effort. ""I loved Ted Kennedy,"" Sanders replied. ""But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don’t apologize for that vote.""

Mark Sanford has seen more than enough to justify the state’s distinctively colorful reputation.For starters, there was the time in 2009 when, as governor, Sanford forever redefined the meaning of “hiking the Appalachian Trail."" And before that came the particularly heated presidential primary campaigns of 2000 and 2008 when a racially charged environment on both the Republican and Democratic sides further cemented South Carolina's status as a breeding ground for campaign trail nastiness. Sanford, however, said he has never seen anything that quite matches the overtly rancorous tenor that Donald Trump and several other leading Republican candidates brought to Saturday night’s debate in Greenville, which Sanford said was “so far outside the norm” of anything that typically takes place in public view. But this is not a typical election. It is, instead, one in which the GOP front-runner has most recently paid no apparent political price for denigrating America’s most prominent Republican family and singling out George W. Bush in particular for failing to prevent the 9/11 attacks -- a previously unthinkable challenge for a serious White House aspirant from either party. For a brief moment, Sanford -- like many other prominent Republicans -- believed the 9/11 argument would mark the turning point against Trump. “I thought, frankly, that that would be a Waterloo moment because everybody’s got their Waterloo moment,” Sanford told HuffPost at a Wednesday rally for presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).Instead, Trump is still riding high, as the rest of the Republican field continues to flail in their uneven attempts to knock him off his horse. “I don’t understand it,” Sanford said. “It defies all political conventions, certainly. I’ve run statewide six times between primary runoffs and generals. That’s a lot of crisscrossing the state over the years. All I can think is there’s some deeper things afoot.”The steepest challenge in taking on Trump to date has been the very nature of the still heavily divided GOP field. Without having settled on which candidate is best positioned to take him on, anti-Trump Republicans have been their own worst enemy. That dynamic, however, may be in the process of changing. The State reported later on Wednesday that Gov. Nikki Haley -- the most popular Republican politician in South Carolina -- will endorse Rubio for president. Haley's move is a significant development that could help the Florida senator to coalesce more of the non-Trump vote.It also serves as a reminder to other like-minded Republicans who'd like to see Trump defeated: Time is running out. “Stop Trump!” It’s a rallying cry that large swaths of the GOP previously attempted to shout from the fields of Iowa and the mountains of New Hampshire. And yet Trump is maintaining a massive lead over the rest of the field here with no candidate appearing ready to get out of the race.“The numbers don’t add up -- they don’t,” said South Carolina Republican strategist Chip Felkel. “There’s just not enough votes to go around to slow Trump down, unless everybody takes a humble pill and recognizes that. Now, convincing any number of candidates or campaign managers that it’s time to roll up the tent is a whole other equation. If they’ve got money, they can always make the case that there’s another day to fight.”Conversations with several attendees at Rubio's rally revealed a consensus that the first-term senator still has work to do in sealing the deal among Republican voters here who are averse to Trump’s candidacy.Mike Ravis of Mt. Pleasant said he is leaning toward Rubio but still has some misgivings.“It seems like Trump’s got this one locked up right now, so really the determining factor is who is second and third right now in South Carolina,” Ravis said. “One thing that concerns me with Rubio is with his experience. We had the same thing with the current president.”Mark Fitzpatrick, also of Mt. Pleasant, said Rubio’s collapse in New Hampshire would not preclude him from supporting the Florida senator but added that he still has not made up his mind.“Of all the candidates, I think he’s the smoothest up there -- the most articulate -- and I also think he’s got the ‘it’ factor,” he said of Rubio.Fitzpatrick said he likely would consider the polling data before casting his ballot on Saturday, echoing a common sentiment here that he intends to vote using his head, rather than his heart.“If it was Jeb [Bush], Rubio and [Ted] Cruz, I would vote for Jeb,” he said. “And I would vote for Jeb because he’s run something. I like when governors run because they’ve been CEO of a major state, whereas these guys have not been.”For his part, Rubio has worked recently to emphasize his accomplishments in the Senate and in the Florida Legislature, even as he has argued the election is “not a resume contest.”In his remarks on Wednesday morning, Rubio did not once mention Trump, but with a speech that leaned heavily on defining and defending what it means to be a true conservative, the implied contrast was clear enough.George Klein, another undecided South Carolina Republican primary voter, sounded like he was almost ready to commit -- assuming that Rubio gets a lift in the polls following the Haley endorsement.“I pretty much want to vote as strategically as possible to make sure that an alternative to Trump would win,” he said. “I don’t know how to determine that -- polls, possibly. I like Rubio very much.”Sanford, however, remained inscrutable. Dressed casually in a fleece pullover and khakis, the former governor and current congressman greeted well-wishers at the back of the room after Rubio had wrapped up his speech.Asked whom he was supporting in the race, Sanford said he didn’t ""have a dog in the fight."" But he also made it clear there is one particular dog in the fight that he'd rather see tied to a leash before further damage to the GOP brand is inflicted. “Where Trump is doing the best is the upstate -- that’s the evangelical Bible Belt of our state -- and there’s a degree of civility and decorum in the way that people conduct themselves up there,” Sanford said, all but shaking his head in disbelief. “If [Trump] wins with the numbers they’re talking about, I think he goes all the way.”Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

The poll, which stands contradictory to other state and national polls, shows the Texas senator 2 percentage points ahead of longtime front-runner Donald Trump.The poll, conducted after the Republican primary debate held in South Carolina on Saturday, shows Cruz in first place with 28 percent of the vote to Trump's 26 percent. The results are within the poll's 4.9 percent margin of error. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is in third place with 17 percent, Ohio Gov. John Kasich follows with 11 percent, Ben Carson has 10 percent and Jeb Bush is last with 4 percent. This is a dramatic shift from last month, when Trump led the field with a 13-point margin over Cruz in the previous NBC/WSJ poll. This is also the first poll since early November to show a first-place candidate who is not Trump, according to the HuffPost Pollster poll aggregate.The results also conflict with the HuffPost Pollster national average, which shows Trump soaring with 38 percent of the vote, well above Cruz, who has 18 percent, and Rubio, who has 16 percent. Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who alongside Democratic pollster Peter Hart conducted the poll on behalf of Hart Research Associates, explained to NBC that the results might be an indication that the poll is ""right on top of a shift in the campaign."" That shift, McInturff said, could be a ""momentary 'pause' before the numbers snap back into place,"" or it could be an enduring change. A difference in the electorate composition could be another factor responsible for the surprising results, according to NBC. The survey has a higher percentage of ""very conservative"" Republican voters than the January poll. Still, weighing the results to match last month's demographics shows Trump just 1 point ahead.It's bad practice, however, to rely solely on one poll.

36,POLITICS,Ted Cruz Rises Above Donald Trump In NBC/WSJ National Poll,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-leads-national-poll_us_56c4db0ce4b0b40245c8d122,The results mark a dramatic shift -- or a dramatic outlier.,2016-02-17,When you and bae first meet and you get all the feels.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569d2e471a00002d00ab0c59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"The Republican primary may have just shifted in Ted Cruz's favor, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll released Wednesday. The poll, which stands contradictory to other state and national polls, shows the Texas senator 2 percentage points ahead of longtime front-runner Donald Trump.The poll, conducted after the Republican primary debate held in South Carolina on Saturday, shows Cruz in first place with 28 percent of the vote to Trump's 26 percent. The results are within the poll's 4.9 percent margin of error. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is in third place with 17 percent, Ohio Gov. John Kasich follows with 11 percent, Ben Carson has 10 percent and Jeb Bush is last with 4 percent. This is a dramatic shift from last month, when Trump led the field with a 13-point margin over Cruz in the previous NBC/WSJ poll. This is also the first poll since early November to show a first-place candidate who is not Trump, according to the HuffPost Pollster poll aggregate.The results also conflict with the HuffPost Pollster national average, which shows Trump soaring with 38 percent of the vote, well above Cruz, who has 18 percent, and Rubio, who has 16 percent. Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who alongside Democratic pollster Peter Hart conducted the poll on behalf of Hart Research Associates, explained to NBC that the results might be an indication that the poll is ""right on top of a shift in the campaign."" That shift, McInturff said, could be a ""momentary 'pause' before the numbers snap back into place,"" or it could be an enduring change. A difference in the electorate composition could be another factor responsible for the surprising results, according to NBC. The survey has a higher percentage of ""very conservative"" Republican voters than the January poll. Still, weighing the results to match last month's demographics shows Trump just 1 point ahead.It's bad practice, however, to rely solely on one poll. It's possible that the NBC/WSJ poll is an outlier -- but it's also possible that it is picking up a change in the campaign. A clearer picture should emerge as more polls are released.In addition, it's important to remember that there is no such thing as a national primary.

37,POLITICS,DeRay Mckesson Faces First Test Of Mayoral Campaign At Baltimore Forum,Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deray-mckesson-baltimore-mayoral-forum_us_56c4bd87e4b0b40245c8acef,"“I’m running ... because I saw something unacceptable and said, ‘I have to do something about it.’”",2016-02-17,Civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson is running for mayor of Baltimore.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c4bf2e1d00002700df61f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BALTIMORE -- Prominent civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson made his first appearance Tuesday as a candidate in Baltimore's mayoral race in front of a room packed with at least 300 people.The Democratic candidate joined 24 other candidates, including Republicans and independents, at a question-and-answer forum at the Belvedere Hotel, a midtown home for young working professionals and artists.The 30-year-old former schoolteacher and administrator shared anecdotes of what led him to activism, including the time a Baltimore police officer pointed a gun in his face. He stopped asked himself how long he was ""willing to wait to make a difference"" and stood up, he said.“I love this city. It’s the city where I was born and raised, where I live, where my family lives and where my family is from -- and I’ve watched it continue to be a city that isn’t working for people,” Mckesson told the crowd.“I’m running for the same reason I decided to teach, the same reason I initially went to St. Louis and Ferguson,"" he added, referring to his protests in those cities against police brutality. ""And it was because I saw something unacceptable and said, ‘I have to do something about it.’”Mckesson, who came to prominence as a protester in Ferguson, Missouri, after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by a police officer, released a wide-ranging platform last week and has raised more than $115,000 in two weeks as a candidate.“You’ll see the platform that I’ve released -- just the first three buckets, there are five more buckets to come -- but it ranges from homelessness to poverty to work around the environment to arts and culture, because all of those things matter,” Mckesson said in his opening speech at the forum. “You should see yourself in the plans of people who say they can lead this city. At the core, it’s making this city work for people and that’s what I’m running to do.”Some attendees found him to be personable and his rhetorical style powerful, and noted that his outsider status could shake up Charm City's political establishment.“I'm impressed with the depth and substance of DeRay's platform so far, and I think the forum showcased his ability to appeal to those discomfited by the political status quo in Baltimore,” said David Pontious, an activist for City Bloc, a student grassroots organization through Baltimore City College. But Pontious added that he has problems with Mckesson ""as a candidate,"" and was glad to see him ""subjected to scrutiny"" at the forum.He wasn't alone -- audience members challenged Mckesson on several points of his platform, and even accused him of having been ""absent"" in Baltimore.Kinji Scott, who is from St. Louis and now works in community affairs in the State Attorney’s Office for Baltimore City, named multiple black men killed by Baltimore Police officers -- including Anthony Anderson, Tyrone West and George King -- before asking why Mckesson would abandon his native city.“Why did you have to go to St. Louis when you could did it right here? When you talk about activism, where have you been in Baltimore City?” Scott asked. “Why are you absent in this city, and then today, you come and take charge? I don’t support all these folk up here. But you come and you indict them and you haven’t been visible in this city. Why are you running for mayor of [Baltimore]?”Mckesson responded by pointing to his time working in Baltimore since 1999 as a teenager and youth organizer for Baltimore’s Safe and Sound Campaign, where he trained adults and youth community leaders.Ralikh Hayes, a community activist, said that while Mckesson did well, it was difficult to ""get a feel"" for the candidates, since they each got only seven minutes to speak.“I think he did OK, all things considered. He was a little nervous but it was a massive crowd with some fire to them,” Hayes said.Those who knew Mckesson, and were familiar with his activism and what he’s done in other cities and Baltimore, had mixed reviews. Some were impressed with his education policy, his words on policing and other facets of his newly released platform. But 20-year-old ShaiVaughn Crawley, a community activist, said that while Mckesson handled his first forum well, it was not promising.“I'm still not convinced that he is who we need to get the job done in this city,” Crawley said. “The political DeRay cannot and will not reflect the greater good of the Black Lives Matter movement. Though distinct and unorthodox in his dialect, his rhetoric and confusing indirect explanations fall right into the category of the other 15-plus candidates that we heard from last night.”Despite the knocks he’s taken during his short campaign, Mckesson told The Huffington Post that he looks forward to participating in more forums, and that it was powerful to connect with Baltimore’s citizens and discuss the city’s power and promise.“I’m not a millionaire. I’m not a former elected official. I’m an activist. I’m a son of Baltimore,"" Mckesson said. ""I’m somebody who has been in this city and in other cities across the country demanding that the city works for people. And I’m ready to do it here.""Also On HuffPost: "
38,POLITICS,Cracks Emerge In GOP Strategy On Supreme Court Nominees,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dean-heller-supreme-court_us_56c4d442e4b08ffac127606b,More and more GOP senators say they'd be open to voting on an Obama nominee.,2016-02-17,Senate Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) doesn't want President Barack Obama to put forward a Supreme Court nominee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_9_56_2043_1153%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- GOP senators are straying from their party's line on a potential Supreme Court nominee, saying they would welcome the chance to vote on a candidate put forward by President Barack Obama.They're small, but significant, departures. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has warned Obama not to even think about putting forward a name to replace the late Antonin Scalia because the chamber won't act on it. ""The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,"" McConnell said Saturday. ""Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.""But since then, GOP senators have indicated a willingness to move forward on a nominee -- even if it's not their ideal outcome. (Their preference would be to wait until after the election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, in hopes that a Republican will win the White House.) Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Wednesday if Obama nominates someone, she will give that person her ""full attention.""Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said the nominee should, at the least, get a fair hearing.Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) put out a statement Wednesday saying, ""The chances of approving a new nominee are slim, but Nevadans should have a voice in the process.""That’s why I encourage the President to use this opportunity to put the will of the people ahead of advancing a liberal agenda on the nation’s highest court. But should he decide to nominate someone to the Supreme Court, who knows, maybe it’ll be a Nevadan,"" he added. His spokesman later clarified, however, that Heller was not indicating a willingness to vote on a nominee, despite the way his comment was initially interpreted.""I think we fall into the trap, if we just simply say [no], sight unseen, we fall into the trap of being obstructionist,"" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said in a radio interview Tuesday.Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), one of the most vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection in 2016, also indicated a willingness to vote on a nominee Tuesday after taking a harder line days earlier. Democrats don't have a ton of leverage. After all, Republicans still control the Senate, and Obama would need to get the vote of every single Democratic senator and 14 GOP senators to get his nominee through.Still, they've been trying to shame Republicans for their refusal to even consider a nominee, before Obama has even put forward a candidate. ""I ... think that they're going to cave in,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said during a caucus event in Reno, Nevada, Wednesday, adding he believed McConnell made a ""mistake"" with his initial comments. ""I think the president’s going to give us a nominee that's a good one, and I think they're going to have to hold hearings and have a vote.""The fight could have consequences not only at the presidential level, but also in Senate races. Most of the at-risk GOP senators up for reelection have backed McConnell's strategy as the party fights to retain control of the chamber after 2016. Democrats have to defend only 10 seats in 2016, the residual benefit of the shellacking they took in 2010 when tea party Republicans swept into office. The two Democratic seats most at risk are in Nevada and Colorado. The GOP, meanwhile, needs to defend 24 -- and six of them are in states that Obama won twice.  This piece was updated with additional comment from Heller's office. Also on HuffPost:"
