""We need to work together to create a standard for better ads online.""His comments came as part of a six-month charm offensive by Google - its Digital News Initiative - to win over newspaper publishers with collaboration on technology, digital newsroom training and funding for small-scale media innovation projects.Over the past decade, the media industry has often accused Google of making money at its expense by making its content freely available via Google News, YouTube and other services to drive audiences to view ads on Google sites instead.While critics have derided Google's Digital News Initiative as offering token handouts to the media industry, some 100 European publishers have signed up to the project since April, d'Asaro Biondo said, up from just 11 initial partners.He said those taking part are free to choose how much they participate and do not need to buy into Google's ""worldview"".Europe's online advertising market grew to 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in 2014, according to industry figures.This is the lifeblood of publishers and other content creators and Google aims to make it easier for news organizations to get their share, d'Asaro Biondo said.Two weeks ago, Google announced a service it calls Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) designed to speed the loading of news pages in mobile phone browsers, potentially reducing reader complaints about ads slowing down page retrievals. AMP will begin running in Google Search early in 2016, he said.Google gets about 90 percent of its revenue from ads.Germany's biggest newspaper publisher Axel Springer last week banned readers who use ad blockers from its Bild tabloid website, stepping up a fight by publishers to stop online advertising revenues being eroded.Some 200 million people used ad blockers last year, up 40 percent from a year earlier, resulting in $22 billion in lost advertising revenue, according to a recent study by Adobe and PageFair, an anti ad-blocking technology company.(Editing by David Clarke)"
1,POLITICS,Ben Carson Now Leads The Republican Field In Iowa,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-iowa_us_5628c87fe4b0ec0a3893405b,Donald Trump has dropped to second place.,2015-10-22,"Ben Carson, who is seeking the GOP nomination for president, is now in first place in Iowa polling.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5628c9291400002200c7a8a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson has now surpassed frontrunner Donald Trump and taken the lead in Iowa, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday.Carson, a neurosurgeon, is now in first place with 28 percent of the vote against Trump's 20 percent among those likely to attend the Iowa Republican caucus. The numbers represent a significant shift from a September Quinnipiac poll that showed Trump leading the field with 27 percent and Carson at 21 percent. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is in third place with 13 percent of the vote, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) stands close behind with 10 percent. Sen Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has 6 percent and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, along with former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, each have 5 percent. No other Republican candidate captures more than 3 percent of the vote.According to the HuffPost Pollster Iowa Caucus chart, which aggregates all publicly available polls, Carson has jumped ahead with 26 percent, and Trump has dipped down to 21 percent. Carson's boost comes primarily as a result of increased support from women. Thirty-three percent of female voters now support Carson and 13 percent support Trump, the poll found. One month ago, female voters were almost evenly split between Carson and Trump in a Quinnipiac poll. Men are evenly divided among both candidates. Twenty-five percent support Carson, and 24 percent support Trump. Carson's support is also strong among white Evangelical Christians. Thirty six percent of white Evangelical Christians support him, versus just 17 percent who support Trump. Carson tops the list as the candidate that voters consider the most honest and trustworthy, and nearly 9 in 10 voters said he shares their values.He is also the most likable candidate in the field with a 74 percent net positive favorable score. Rubio follows with a 55 percent net favorable rating, while Trump has a 10 percent net favorable. Jeb Bush has a net negative 8 percent favorable rating. Nationally, Trump continues to lead the field. According to the HuffPost Pollster National chart, Trump is in first place with 30 percent, and Carson is in second with 22 percent. Primary poll results this early in the race are poorly equipped to predict the final outcome and should be taken as snapshots, rather than definitive proclamations of who will win. Quinnipiac University surveyed 574 likely Iowa Republican Caucus voters using live interviews to landlines and cell phones from Oct. 14 through Oct. 20. Also on HuffPost:"
2,POLITICS,Americans Don't Know What To Think About The Benghazi Committee,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/benghazi-committee-polls_us_56295839e4b0ec0a3893e51b,What they say about the investigation depends on how you ask.,2015-10-22,Polls show that Americans generally think the House Select Committee on Benghazi has gone too far. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5629589f1900002e00b94b0c.jpeg?cache=mdO42EuduI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans generally think that the House Select Committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks has gone too far. But their exact reaction depends on how the question is asked. Some polls find that a majority of Americans think that it's a fair and honest investigation, others show relatively split opinions, and still others show that a majority believe the committee is politically motivated. In short: It really is impossible to know what the public thinks of the committee's work.Just take a look at these surveys.There are two main takeaways here: Collectively, the polls do show that Americans for the most part think the committee is motivated by politics. But if you look at the varied individual polls, they indicate the public doesn't know enough about the investigation to form an opinion and instead is answering based on the wording and framing of questions or relying on partisan beliefs.CNN/ORC asked the question in two different ways and got two different responses. In one variation, it asked if the committee is ""conducting an objective investigation"" or if it's being used as a means ""to gain political advantage."" Seventy-two percent answered ""to gain political advantage."" In a second variation, they asked if ""Republicans have gone too far"" or if they've ""handled the hearings appropriately."" Fifty-one percent sided with the committee, answering that it had handled the hearings appropriately. Monmouth University made mention of Clinton's email use in its question, a subject most Americans have grown tired of. ABC/Post asked if Republicans are ""raising legitimate concerns"" or if they are ""mainly trying to damage Hillary Clinton."" Both polls resulted in the majority answering that the committee was motivated to go after Clinton. Comparatively, AP-GFK poll asked if the investigation is a ""justified attempt to find out what happened."" A majority answered that the committee was in the right. On the other hand, questions that were more open-ended, in which an undecided or neutral option was explicitly offered, like the NBC/WSJ and YouGov polls, produced answers that were more evenly divided across the board.Polls for which cross tabs were available (Monmouth, CNN/ORC and YouGov ) unsurprisingly showed a clear partisan divide in which a majority of Republicans sided with the committee's intentions. Monmouth University found that 57 percent of Republicans supported the committee's investigation to ""learn the facts,"" while only 10 percent of Democrats said the same. Similarly, the CNN poll found that 74 percent of Republicans thought the committee had handled the hearings appropriately, while only 20 percent of Democrats said the same. The YouGov poll found that only 12 percent of Republicans think the committee is politically motivated, compared to 50 percent of Democrats. On Thursday, the House Select Committee on Benghazi spent hours questioning Clinton on her role in the 2012 Benghazi attack."

""It's rough on the body. Any time you play a football game and play another one a few days later, it's going to be tough on the body. But it's just another one of those things. Another one of those simple contradictions of the league, because they care about us.""The half-week between the Seahawks’ Week 6 and 7 contests means that players will have three fewer days than normal to rest and rehab their injuries, with many being thrown back into the fire before their bodies have properly recovered from the previous matchup’s beating.Sherman is not the first to call the NFL on what SBNation deemed the “hypocritical” nature of Thursday Night Football. In a league whose party line is seemingly we do care about player safety, players from Green Bay to Houston have all pointed out the tension between the NFL’s PR-conscious statements on safety and the grind of suiting up two times in five days. While Packers offensive lineman Josh Sitton said last year that Thursday Night Football is “all about money,” Houston Texan running back Arian Foster announced just weeks later that it puts “every player on the field in danger.”This is hardly the only time that the discussion at Sherman’s press conference has shifted from strategy to safety, as just two Wednesdays ago, his comments on the NFL’s recommended tackling technique largely undermined the league’s platform on proper head trauma prevention.Also on HuffPost:"
4,COLLEGE,This University Leader Showed How Colleges Should Own Up To Failures On Sexual Assault Cases,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-president-apology-sexual-assault_us_5628fc90e4b0443bb562ddc0,Why a chancellor decided to apologize for his school's handling of campus rape cases.,2015-10-22,"Powers said his letter was inspired in part by a screening of ""The Hunting Ground.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56292c981900002d00b94a15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The head of the University of Alaska-Fairbanks did remarkable something on Tuesday: He admitted his school had not handled sexual assault cases well, and apologized for it. ""Universities across the country have not done right by their students,"" UAF interim Chancellor Mike Powers said in a campuswide email. ""UAF, in some respects, was no different.""The University of Alaska system is currently under a Title IX compliance review by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, which is probing how the school's campuses handle sexual assault. But UAF announced this week that an internal review, done in anticipation of the federal investigation, had found numerous errors on the part of the university.Students and advocates for sexual assault victims have long wanted to see campus administrators hold themselves accountable for botching their responses to sexual assault cases. Powers indicated in his email that this expectation was reasonable.For years, ""we failed to follow our own student discipline policies for the most serious violations of the student code of conduct: assault, burglary and rape,"" he said. ""We investigated reports of rape, and often took informal action like removing the accused from dorms or campus. But, until recently, students were not being suspended or expelled for sexual assault, or for any major violation of our code of conduct.""The chancellor added that the failure to punish ""perpetrators of this heinous violence"" sends the wrong message, and noted that the issue was personal for him.""I am deeply sorry for how our lack of action affected our students and their friends and families,"" he said. ""As the brother of someone who was similarly violated 40 years ago, I am incensed that our communities still have not adequately dealt with this opportunistic and cowardly behavior. It's time for this to end.""Powers said in an interview with The Huffington Post on Wednesday that his letter was not something assistants or public relations staff prepared for him -- the words were his own.""I hope that straightforward response demonstrates authenticity, and honesty, and willingness and courage to shoulder this together as a team for the entire university,"" Powers said. ""Frankly, for the whole community.""UAF's review of 42 sexual misconduct cases between 2011 and 2014 found five instances in which students should have been suspended or expelled, but weren't. The university says it will continue to review why those cases didn't result in serious sanctions, but has deemed it a ""breakdown in the system"" for the time being.""We realized we had a problem, made corrections to our practices and then decided to tell the public,"" said Marmian Grimes, a UAF spokeswoman. ""While we expect that the deficiencies will be a factor in the [Office of Civil Rights'] findings, we decided we didn't need to wait for the OCR report to do the right thing and tell our community.""What Made Him Decide To ApologizeGrimes said Powers was motivated in part to send the apology after he watched ""The Hunting Ground,"" a documentary on campus sexual assault, at a screening that he attended with some other university administrators.Powers explained that the film, which follows sexual assault survivors who turned into activists after schools handled their cases inappropriately, helped him ""understand emotionally what is happening across the nation.""""I would say that was a very influential mechanism to help really shock us into understanding how the nation is perceiving this issue,"" Powers told HuffPost. UAF hosted a larger screening of ""The Hunting Ground"" on campus this week, and will hold a total of four town halls by the end of the month, where students will have the opportunity to question top university officials about sexual violence on campus. How Other College Presidents Have RespondedWhile more than 130 colleges and universities are currently under federal investigations over allegations that they mishandled sexual assaults, and many have commissioned their own audits, few admit fault or make any apology the way Powers did this week. A 2015 survey of college presidents found that the vast majority think their schools are handling sexual assaults well. A similar survey from the year before found that no college presidents felt they ever mishandled sexual assault cases.One school that has admitted to dropping the ball is Amherst College, whose president, Biddy Martin, conceded in 2013 that ""clearly, the administration’s responses to reports have left survivors feeling that they were badly served.""George Martin, head of the University of Virginia's governing board, made a similar remark in November 2014, saying, ""To all survivors of sexual assault, I am sorry."" At Bob Jones University, president Steve Pettit issued an apology after an outside probe found the Christian school mishandled cases of sexual assault.Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, the documentary filmmakers behind ""The Hunting Ground,"" wrote an op-ed following Powers' email, saying the country needs more college administrators like him.""Powers' bold statements put Alaska at the forefront for how colleges and universities should respond to unacceptably high numbers of sexual assaults on college campuses,"" Dick and Ziering said. ""We hope that the chancellor’s comments embolden other university leaders to stand with him.""______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

5,POLITICS,Prominent Dreamer Joins Bernie Sanders Campaign,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-dreamer-cesar-vargas_us_562950fee4b0ec0a3893defa,The undocumented activist has been critical of Hillary Clinton.,2015-10-22,"Cesar Vargas speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 21, 2010.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Cesar Vargas, a leading undocumented activist, joined Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Thursday, Vargas' advocacy group announced -- another sign the senator's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination is ramping up its efforts on immigration and the Latino vote. Vargas is a co-founder of the Dream Action Coalition, which is led by young undocumented immigrants, or Dreamers. The group has been heavily critical of Republicans on immigration, but has also chastised President Barack Obama over deportations and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, one of Sanders' opponents, over donations from private prison lobbyists. Dream Action Coalition has applauded Sanders for his efforts to ban government contracts for private prison companies, which also operate many immigrant detention centers. Neither the Sanders campaign nor Vargas responded to a request for comment. Dream Action Coalition announced the move in a tweet.The organization did not endorse Sanders (I-Vt.) but praised him in statements Thursday. Dream Action Coalition co-director Carlos Vargas said Sanders ""is a strong choice: he is great on immigration in general, stood with us on the border children and he wants to get the Corrections Corporation of America, GEO Group and other corporations out of politics,"" referring to two major private prison companies.""At the same time that Bernie is trying to chase them out of DC, Hillary is accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars from GEO and CCA's registered lobbyists,"" he continued. ""[O]ne day they will call in several hundred thousand dollars worth of favors and skew the discussion on immigration reform to keep their detention facilities full.""Later Thursday, the Clinton campaign said it will no longer accept contributions from lobbyists or PACs of private prison companies, and will donate previous contributions from them to charity.Clinton has also tapped a prominent Dreamer for her campaign. In May, she hired Lorella Praeli of the advocacy group United We Dream as Latino outreach director. Praeli was undocumented before obtaining a green card in 2012.Sanders has said he is trying to increase his Latino outreach. An August Gallup poll found that only 25 percent of Latino voters were familiar with him, compared to 75 percent who were familiar with Clinton. His campaign earlier this month appointed activist Arturo Carmona, who was executive director of Presente.org, as Latino outreach director. ""What we are trying very, very hard to do -- you are going to see us moving very aggressively in that area -- is introduce myself to the Latino community,"" Sanders said at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's annual Public Policy Conference on Oct. 7. ""I will fight for every vote I can get in the Latino community.""Cesar Vargas came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was five years old. He is undocumented but legally able to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, although he is unable to fulfill his dream of joining the military. In June, a New York appeals court ruled he is eligible to practice law, four years after he finished law school.

7,POLITICS,Democrats On Indian Affairs Committee Support Fast-tracking Tribal Energy Development,Mariam Baksh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tribal-energy-development-indian-affairs-comm_us_56290acde4b0ec0a38937c21,"""If there's a coal mine on a reservation, let's use it.""",2015-10-22,"Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), pictured, and other Democrats are open to fast-tracking tribal energy development.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56290d4712000026007e5be4.jpeg?cache=FtNf3RdEwz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In what's become a rare occurrence in Washington, there was bipartisan agreement in a Senate hearing Wednesday that Native American tribes should have more leeway to develop energy resources on their land.“Global warming is a real problem, but if they find a coal mine on a reservation, let’s use it,"" Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) said.Franken's comment prompted Indian Affairs Committee Chair John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) to invite the Democrat to come over and sit on the Republican side of the committee bench for the day. “Save that video tape!” Barrasso said, seeking to preserve the moment, on the record.The oversight hearing focused on a Government Accountability Office report that Barrasso requested in January 2014 on tribal energy development. The GAO report, released in June, gave the Bureau of Indian Affairs a failing grade in its administration of tribal energy development, citing inadequate staffing and a lack of data to verify ownership and availability of Indian oil and gas resources, as well as an overly complex regulatory framework that has hindered development. Through interviews and literature reviews, the GAO found that the agency's review of a lease for a wind project took 18 months. This caused South Dakota’s Rosebud Sioux tribe -- one of the poorest in the country -- to lose an interconnection agreement with the local utility, according to the 2011 testimony of then-tribe President Rodney M. Bordeaux. The project has not been able to move forward as a result, according to the report.Larry Roberts, the deputy assistant secretary of Indian Affairs for the Department of the Interior, who testified before the committee Wednesday, attributed the agency’s staffing problems to its inability to compete for employees with the private sector. He told the ranking Democrat on the committee, Jon Tester of Montana, that pay increases for staff would help. He also said it was challenging for the agency to function under the stringent across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration. Committee members pressed Roberts on why there were so many obstacles for tribes to overcome in the permitting process.“There’s 100 steps and 7 agencies that they need to go through,” Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) said. Heitkamp said that until the federal government stops treating tribal lands as public lands and starts treating them as belonging to sovereign nations, they’ll always be dealing with the same issue.Franken said he supports tribal energy development despite concerns about greenhouse gas emissions because, as a member of the Indian Affairs Committee, he has seen the dire economic situation facing Indian country.“We are the ones hearing the testimony on native youth suicide. We’re the ones hearing the testimony that families have to double up because they can’t get housing,” Franken told Roberts. “It’s frustrating to then read this report that the BIA isn’t functioning efficiently. Well, why should we fund the agency if that’s the case?”Native Americans experience exceptionally high rates of poverty, unemployment and youth suicide, which is five times the national average. Franken said anything that would help create jobs and address tribes’ economic challenges is welcome. Franken also argued that energy development on Indian lands should be easier than it is anywhere else because of the ""federal trust,"" which is an agreement between the U.S. and tribes to preserve the rights and sovereignty of tribal nations under laws and a Supreme Court ruling dating back to 1831. Tester asked Roberts whether BIA would support legislation he cosponsored with Barrasso, which would allow tribes to be involved in the Interior Department's decision-making process for lease agreements on tribal land. Roberts said his agency would prefer to roll the provisions of that bill into the HEARTH (Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Home Ownership) Act, which allows tribes to voluntarily seek environmental review through the Interior Department’s Office of Trust Services. If the tribes meet the requirements under that act, they don’t then have to get further approval by the secretary before entering into lease agreements. Roberts said the HEARTH Act is working, as 20 tribes have taken advantage of it. A bill passed in the House earlier this month would supersede the Interior Department's authority by deeming lease appraisals -- to determine who owns the land, whether it belongs to an individual, is being held in trust or is viable under the tribe’s management -- approved if the agency fails to respond within 60 days. The bill would also allow the Navajo Nation to enter into lease agreements for their mineral rights without seeking department approval. Those rights refer to metallic minerals like copper and silver, but also to oil and gas resources.The House bill would also block the Interior Department's rule intended to regulate fracking from applying to Indian lands, unless tribes want it to.Republicans on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee also took aim at the department's fracking rule within the context of tribal sovereignty, but Roberts testified that flexibility for tribes is already written into the rule. He could not speak at length on the rule since it is currently under a legal challenge from the Southern Ute tribe. The Hill reported the White House's Office of Management and Budget opposes the House bill because it circumvents the federal permitting process."

11,POLITICS,Obama Administration Approves Plan To Make Prison Phone Calls More Affordable,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prison-phone-costs-fcc-obama_us_5628f5f0e4b0443bb562d907,"""Today’s vote will never make up for the inactions of the past, but it is my hope that the order will finally bring relief to those that have waited for so long.""",2015-10-22,FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn praised the agency's approval of a new regulation on Thursday that will cap rates and fees for prison phone calls.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5628f74f12000026007e5bac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 on Thursday to cap the rates and fees that companies can charge for phone service in prisons and jails.Right now, providers can bill inmates and their families hundreds of dollars per month to make phone calls, tacking on exorbitant fees for transactions, account maintenance and other services. Inmates who can't afford these costs don't have other options, because providers monopolize service. The practice has proven hugely profitable for companies like Securus Technologies, Global Tel*Link and Telmate. Prison operators also benefit because companies pay commissions in order to win contracts. In a letter to FCC Chairman Thomas Wheeler last week, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and 15 Democrats called these payments kickbacks, and said they incentivize a system in which prisons profit from charging inmates higher rates.""Voting to endorse today’s reforms will eliminate the most egregious case of market failure I have ever seen in my 17 years as a state and federal regulator,"" FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said on Thursday.The new FCC proposal caps state and federal prison phone rates at 11 cents a minute. Jail rates will be capped at 14 to 22 cents per minute, depending on the number of people in the facility. The plan also limits additional fees and ""strongly encourages parties to move away from site commissions."" The proposal has proven deeply unpopular with prison phone providers, several of whom threatened legal action against the FCC prior to the vote. Securus, whose earnings grew from $87 million in 2013 to $114.6 million last year, said that the preliminary proposal could be a ""business-ending event."" The companies fear they will collect less per call, but will still have to pay commissions to prison operators.The National Sheriffs' Association was displeased with the ruling. ""The rate caps established by the FCC will force many jails to limit, or eliminate altogether, access to phones because they simply cannot afford the cost of the service,"" said Jonathan Thompson, executive director and CEO of the association. Immigration detention centers are included in the new plan and will be treated like jails, although the caps don't apply to international calls. This change will affect people like Cesia Pineda, whose husband is an immigration detainee at Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. Pineda spends between $200 and $250 each month to talk to him on the phone. Gregory Chen, director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told The Huffington Post that his organization has encountered limited phone access in family detention facilities that can ""functionally erode the right of the mothers to access legal counsel."" ""A meaningful reduction in fees, as the FCC proposal aims to achieve, would ensure phone access for immigrant detainees who are held for federal civil, not criminal, purposes,"" Chen said.Twenty-six civil and human rights groups support the new proposal, including the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups sent a letter to Wheeler on Oct. 15 urging him to ensure reasonable inmate calling rates. Studies consistently show that meaningful communication beyond the prison walls helps to promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism, Clyburn noted on Thursday.""Today’s vote will never make up for the inactions of the past, but it is my hope that the order will finally bring relief to those that have waited for so long,"" she said.This story has been updated to include a comment from Jonathan Thompson of the National Sheriffs' Association."
12,POLITICS,"Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush Still Favorites of Wall Street Banks",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-bush-wall-street_us_562934f1e4b0aac0b8fc26e9,The banks are sticking with their picks.,2015-10-22,Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lead in the race for campaign cash from executives and employees of big Wall Street banks.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56293801140000e800c7aa0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Executives and employees of the biggest bank institutions in the country have continued to put their money behind two candidates in the 2016 presidential race: Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Jeb Bush.From April through September, Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, raised $636,065 from employees (and their spouses) of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclay’s, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Wells Fargo. Bush, the former Republican presidential frontrunner, pulled in $606,453.After starting his campaign on June 15, Bush has nearly caught up to Clinton’s total fundraising from big bank executives. From July through September, Bush raised $253,503 to Clinton’s $203,456 from these donors.Campaign Contributions From Big Bank Executives & EmployeesSource: Federal Election Commission.Of these totals, Clinton has received $132,124 from Morgan Stanley executives and employees, $95,709 from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and $94,602 from those at JPMorgan Chase. Bush's total includes $189,800 from executives and employees at Goldman Sachs and $90,960 from those at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Contributions came in the third quarter of 2015 just before the candidates began to roll out their policy proposals for the financial sector. The policies offered by the two favorites of Wall Street donors couldn’t be more different.Clinton released her financial sector policy agenda on Oct. 8. The policies included closing loopholes in the post-financial meltdown Dodd-Frank reform law and an increase in enforcement action targeting both the banking and alternative investment industries.Her plan would increase penalties for fraud and require the executives in charge of the banking institutions -- the people making campaign contributions -- to personally pay settlements, rather than using corporate treasury funds. She would reverse loopholes poked by bank lobbyists in the Dodd-Frank law since it was enacted in 2010.Clinton also supports Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s Truth in Settlements Act to show the true cost -- or lack thereof -- to the bottom line of financial institutions when they pay settlements. Every bank whose executives are donating to presidential candidates has entered into settlements worth tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars to end government investigations to illegal practices since the 2008 global financial meltdown.The Democratic presidential candidate further endorsed legislation proposed by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) to slow the movement of Washington political appointees to high-paying Wall Street bank jobs and vice versa. The policies put forward by Clinton do stop short of those proposed by her primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to break up the banks and restructure them.Bush, on the other hand, has criticized the Dodd-Frank reforms as overburdening regulations that put more risk into the banking system. His campaign has not released a comprehensive plan on how a Bush administration would regulate or oversee Wall Street.""We have more banks with more concentrated assets in the United States, and the systematic risk is perhaps greater now than it was when the law was signed,"" Bush said prior to announcing his presidential campaign.The former Florida governor further stated that “bad banks” should face regulations. The definition of “bad banks,” however, may include all of the big banks since they have all admitted to have broken laws and paid multimillion-dollar settlements to end investigations in the past seven years.Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) is the only other 2016 candidate to have raised more than $100,000 from the big banks. His campaign received $146,619 from executives and employees of the 10 big banks. Half of these funds came from executives and employees at Goldman Sachs.Where Did Clinton, Bush, Rubio Get Their Bank Contributions From?Source: Federal Election Commission.Both Clinton and Bush were aided in raising their campaign cash from big bank executives by a number of fundraisers working for those banks, also known as bundlers.Bundlers who raised more than $100,000 for Clinton’s campaign include Morgan Stanley’s Tom Nides, a former assistant secretary of state under Clinton; JPMorgan Chase’s Karen Keogh, Clinton’s former New York City director when she served as senator from New York; and JPMorgan Chase’s Eric Gioia, a former New York City council member.Bush’s bundlers raising more than $17,600 include Barclay’s executives Robert Foresman, Stephen Lessing, Willam Cohen, Nicholas Howard, Keith Overlander, Martin Shafiroff and Larry Wieseneck; Goldman Sachs executives James Herring, James Donovan and Dina Powell; Credit Suisse’s Timothy O’Hara; and Morgan Stanley’s John Sargent."

Yet he received a $1,500 bonus while he was under investigation, according to the report. That agent is ""currently assigned to another DEA office in the United States,"" the report says.An assistant regional director stationed overseas allegedly ""made numerous inappropriate sexual comments; asked [an assistant] to watch pornographic movies; and, among other allegations, routinely threw items, yelled at employees, and used other vulgarities in the office and at official functions,"" and ultimately received a letter of reprimand. He received a $5,000 bonus just before he was issued that reprimand. Five of 10 individuals who came under investigation starting in 2010 for soliciting prostitutes abroad between 2001 and 2004 received bonuses or time off during that investigation, according to the inspector general's report.A separate report on the DEA's handling of the ""sex party"" allegations was released in March, garnering significant attention from the media and members of Congress. Then-DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart was grilled by Congress over how her agency handled those allegations, and she resigned in May. According to the latest report, a DEA supervisor who was eventually suspended for three days received a $2,500 bonus in 2012 over the objections of the acting chief inspector. Another supervisor who ultimately received a letter of caution was given a $8,400 bonus as the matter was being investigated. Yet another supervisor who ultimately received an eight-day suspension got a $2,000 bonus.The review found that ""the DEA did not consistently follow its policy or process and failed to document the rationale for its decisions"" to reward employees who committed ""significant misconduct"" or were the subject of ongoing investigations."
