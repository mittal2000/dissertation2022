0,POLITICS,Here's What Will Happen If The DHS Shuts Down,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-happens-if-dhs-shuts-down_n_6773218.html,,2015-02-28,"WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 27: The U.S. Capitol is seen at dusk as the U.S. Congress struggles to find a solution to fund the Department of Homeland Security on February 27, 2015 in Washington, DC. The DHS budget is set to expire at midnight this evening after the House of Representatives failed to pass a short term funding bill earlier today. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eb4424000050005778d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Feb 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress was scrambling before a deadline at midnight on Friday to pass a $39.7 billion funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, which is charged with securing U.S. borders, airports and coastal waters.The following is a rundown of what would likely happen if spending authority at the U.S. domestic security agency is allowed to expire, based on the agency's own contingency plans and congressional researchers:FLIGHTSMost DHS employees would stay on the job, especially those involved in securing and protecting airports, borders and other ports of entry into the United States.Transportation Security Administration passenger screenings and the Federal Air Marshal Service would continue uninterrupted as would Coast Guard operations and disaster relief.In all, DHS has designated about 85 percent of its workforce, or around 200,000 people, as 'exempt' from furlough because they are involved in protecting human life and property or are funded by other sources, such as customs fees. But while these people would be required to work, they would not be paid until a new funding bill is signed into law.TENS OF THOUSANDS IDLEDDHS has said it expects to idle about 30,000 employees not serving in frontline operations. Activities such as procurement, hiring, training and administrative support would be hardest hit.DHS said ""the bulk"" of its management would be furloughed, including many people dedicated to the command and coordination of domestic anti-terrorism activities.E-Verify, an automated computer system that companies use to check the citizenship and visa status of prospective employees, would be shut down.IMMIGRATION AGENCIESU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, targeted by Republican efforts to block Democratic President Barack Obama's 2012 and 2014 immigration orders, would ironically be the least affected by a DHS funding lapse. It would keep 98 percent of its roughly 12,500 employees on the job because it is funded almost entirely from fees paid by applicants, according to the Congressional Research Service.USCIS had planned to start taking applications for one of Obama's orders on Feb. 18, but this was halted by a temporary federal court order issued in Texas.LOCAL IMPACTSHomeland Security awards about $2.3 billion in grants annually to state and local police and fire departments and other first responder groups to help them prepare and train for emergencies and disasters and to help secure big events such as the Superbowl. It would stop distributing these, hampering training and preparedness.Should any disasters occur during a shutdown, The Federal Emergency Management Agency would have to limit its preparation activities and pare back personnel it sends into the field.FOREGONE INVESTMENTSA lapse or short-term extension of DHS spending authority would deny a $400 million budget increase for the agency this year, which would help pay for more border patrol agents and customs officers and new border security technology - Republican priorities.Funding for new detention centers for thousands of child migrants also would be lost or delayed until a full DHS spending bill is approved.

The demonstrators also called for nonviolence and the end of racism. On February 10, a Haitian immigrant in the Dominican Republic was found hanged, reportedly lynched, from a tree in a park in Santiago. AFP PHOTO/ HECTOR RETAMAL (Photo credit should read HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea49c260000cf00814217.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Today is Independence day in the Dominican Republic. Across the country, thousands of Dominicans will celebrate the 171st anniversary since the expulsion of the Haitian government after 22 years in power, controlling the entire island of Hispanola. Incidentally the anniversary of Dominican independence from Spain, who colonized the country twice, passes without notice.Independence from Haiti didn't bring about a peaceful resolution between the two countries. Under the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in 1937, between 9,000 and 20,000 Haitians were macheted to death, just for their nationality. This violent event, known as the Parsley Massacre, has been burnt into the collective memory of Haitians and their descents living in the Dominican Republic.Fast forward to today and these descendants are facing fresh issues of discrimination themselves. This week thousands of Haitians in Port-au-Prince protested against the treatment of Haitians and Haitian Dominicans in the DR. This was sparked by the fact that earlier this month, Henry Claude Jean, Dominican shoeshiner of Haitian descent, was lynched in a public square in the Dominican city of Santiago. There have been conflicting accounts of exactly what happened, but tensions are running high between the two nations. Racism has long since been an issue in the region. When I was living in a Haitian settlement a few years ago, I saw daily examples of discrimination against Dominicans of Haitian descent, who are recognized for having darker skin than other Dominicans. They would regularly be taken off public buses and asked to present papers by police officials, and were frequently subject to verbal abuse as well as institutionalized racism that prevented them from having access to equal levels of education and employment. As a teacher in a Dominican school, I felt helplessly frustrated for the bright students in the class who would not be allowed to continue past eighth grade, because they didn't have the Dominican papers that they needed in order to sit the national exam to go to high school. However, at that time the law only affected those students whose parents had not registered their birth.Things have become worse since the Dominican Republic's Supreme Court in 2013, which retroactively denied birthright citizenship to people born in the country after 1929 to illegal immigrant parents. Haitians, who make up 85 percent of the immigrants in the DR were hit hard by the ruling, which stripped 200,000 of them of their citizenship, rendering them stateless. Having never been to Haiti, nor having Haitian documents, these people are left unprotected by any state and prevented from voting, going to school or working legally. This means that they face a cycle of exploitation working in sugarcane plantations, where many Haitians were encouraged to work through bilateral agreements between the Haiti and the DR, who aimed to relocate a cheap labour force. A number of parents in the village, so concerned that they are for the status of their children in the eyes of the Dominican legislation, have registered their children under other people's names in order to make sure that they are recognized as Dominican by the state. This means that there are children who are having their history on paper rewritten in order to protect their right to education and a state under which they may be protected.The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights condemned the ruling passed by the Dominican Supreme Court, and in November 2014 the Dominican Republic passed another ruling declaring that the Dominican Republic's acceptance of the Inter-American Court's authority was unconstitutional -- an acceptance which had passed over 15 years earlier.International concern has risen over the situation of stateless Dominicans of Haitian descent, and prolific writers, Junot Diaz, Julia Alvarez and Edwidge Danticat have expressed their concerns about the human rights issue across a number of platforms including newspapers, social media and in public talks. An open letter signed by numerous Dominicans living in the U.S. was written to New York's governor at the end of 2014. Junot Diaz faced a great deal of criticism from intellectuals and government officials in the Dominican Republic following his comments on the issue, and has his ""Dominican-ness"" challenged. This month similar accusations of ""unpatriotic"" attitudes were directed at Dominican journalists in the DR. Amnesty International expressed concerns when four journalists reported that they had been harassed and received death threats after covering the issues facing Dominicans of Haitian descent. In May 2014 the Dominican Republic passed a ruling which required that those born to undocumented foreign parents, whose birth was never declared, register to a scheme to obtain a residence permit which would be needed to later claim citizenship in the country. The deadline for this was February 1, 2015, and only about five percent of the people entitled to do so have managed to register. There are three primary reasons for this. Firstly, illiteracy and lack of awareness has limited the number of people who have had access, others reject the idea that they have to reapply for papers which they already held, and those who have tried to register have found themselves faced with a number of bureaucratic hurdles that have made it impossible to do so.Being stateless effectively makes those affected by the ruling voiceless too, and it appears that the voices of Dominicans speaking out against the treatment of Haitian Dominicans are also being silenced. On the most patriotic day of the year, it is important to remember those Dominicans who in every way consider themselves to be Dominican, who have been abandoned by the state that they call home."
2,HEALTHY LIVING,A Test For Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Meredith Melnick,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-test_n_6774090.html,,2015-02-28,"(AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND OUT) Rhonda Beech who has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome at her Bayswater home on 26th July, 2005.

Yet there's no reliable lab test for the illness, and researchers are still struggling to understand why and how the disease develops. That situation may soon improve, as researchers have found key disruptions in the immune systems of patients who've had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome fewer than three years, a discovery that could open the door to new tests and more individually tailored treatments for the debilitating illness.""Over 70 percent of patients have a delay in diagnosis of at least a year"" and sometimes a decade, says Mady Hornig, lead author of the new study and an associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. That's partially because diagnosing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome—more properly known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME/CFS—is usually a matter of tracking specific symptoms and ruling out a variety of other, more easily identified disorders.Now, Hornig and her collaborators have discovered specific differences in blood samples taken from patients still in the early phases of the disease compared with other patients and healthy people. That suggests ""there may be hope for early diagnosis,"" she says.That optimism stems from two separate studies on a total of 298 people with ME/CFS and 348 healthy individuals. Of that ME/CFS test group, 52 patients had had the disease fewer than three years. Because diagnoses are so often delayed, Hornig says, that group is often overlooked.Overlooked but crucial, it turns out. When Hornig and colleagues studied blood samples from the different groups, they found higher levels of a few dozen different cytokines, the chemical messengers that mobilize the immune system in response to infection, compared with the control group.""We know that [the immune system] should shut down"" after fighting off a virus or bacteria, but instead the system that regulates cytokines themselves ""goes off the rails"" in the early stages of ME/CFS, Hornig says. That suggests doctors could use high cytokine levels to help diagnose the disease in its early stages.Curiously, though, many of the same cytokines that were abundant in the early stages were in unusually low supply after three years. That's an observation Hornig says could help researchers understand the genesis and trajectory of ME/CFS. It could also lead to treatments specific to a patient's stage of the disease.""The message is not that once you're past the three-year mark,"" you've missed your chance, Hornig adds. ""There may be different treatments that are effective in early-stage disease versus later-stage disease.""While the latest report compares people with early-stage ME/CFS to those in later stages, the team is working on tracking individuals with the disease as it develops over time. That will help researchers understand whether ME/CFS develops similarly across all patients, and it might help reveal treatments aimed at resetting the immune system to it's natural state. ""We're eager to keep forging on,"" Hornig says."

For companies choosing to locate in the United States, deciding the state in which to base their operations can be very difficult.To determine America’s best states for business, 24/7 Wall St. identified nearly 50 measures that contribute to the business climate and reviewed them in each of the 50 states. The measures were classified into eight larger categories that independently measured various risks and benefits of doing business in each state. (Click here for a complete methodology.)The health of a state’s economy, the result of a confluence of factors, is perhaps the most important consideration for businesses choosing a location. The growth of economic output in 2013 in seven of the 10 best states for business was greater than the national GDP growth rate of 1.8%.Another indication of a healthy economy, the job market, was also strong in the 10 best states for business. All of the 10 states had unemployment rates below the national unemployment rate of 7.4% in 2013. Four of the worst states for business had unemployment rates that exceeded the national rate.Click here for the best states for businessHowever, while a state’s economy is tied to a host of factors, not all factors benefit businesses in the same way. The business climate in some states was more favorable to companies primarily concerned with minimizing the costs and risks of operating a business. These states, which include North Dakota, Wyoming, and Texas, tended to enjoy ample natural resources, low cost of living, and low regulation.Some states benefit from a well-educated and highly skilled labor force. They are able to attract businesses that require these skills, such as professional and business services, health and education services, and information. In return, these businesses drive economic growth in these states through technology and innovation. These states include Massachusetts, Virginia, and Minnesota.While it is emphasized more in some industries than in others, a low cost of doing business is a major reason to choose to operate in a particular state. The average cost of goods and services in six of the best states for business was lower than the national average. This was generally driven by beneficial tax climates, lower expenses from utilities and real estate, and lower average employee compensations.Click here for the worst states for businessAlthough the type and size of operating costs vary considerably between industries, wages are a major expense for many businesses. The average wage and salary in three of the 10 best states for business was roughly inline with the national average of $50,012 in 2013, while in five other states, average wages were below the national figure.While lower wages lower the cost of doing business, they are also frequently tied to jobs with lower educational attainment. Among the five best states for business with lower than average wages, three had lower educational attainment rates than the national figure. In these states, including North Dakota and Wyoming, the prevalence of industries that require high-skilled labor was also relatively low.Nevertheless, the percent of STEM jobs in a majority of the best states for business — jobs related to science, technology, engineering, or mathematics — was generally high. At least one in five of all jobs in eight of the 10 best states for business were STEM jobs. On the other hand, the percent of jobs in STEM fields was relatively low in the worst states for business.In addition to a highly-educated labor force, access to capital can also drive innovation in a state. In 2013, 13.26 venture capital deals were made per 1 million Americans. In seven of the worst states for business, there were fewer than three such deals per 1 million residents. In the best states, on the other hand, investments were far more likely. In Massachusetts, there were 57 venture capital deals made per 1 million state residents, by far the highest nationwide.These are the best (and worst) states for business."

Tehran denies it has any nuclear arms program and often points out that Israel is apparently the only country in the region with such weapons.On Wednesday U.S. officials questioned Netanyahu's judgment and said his outspoken condemnation of efforts to reach an Iranian deal had injected destructive partisanship into U.S.-Israeli ties.""I respect U.S. President Barack Obama,"" Netanyahu said at the Western Wall where earlier he placed his palms on the stones in whose crevices faithful place written messages to God.""I believe in the strength of Israel's relations with the U.S. and through them we shall overcome these differences, as well as those to come,"" he said.Republicans who control Congress invited Netanyahu without consulting Obama or other leading Democrats.

Instead, in what is another sad look at how truly incapable of governing today's Republican Party is, a one week emergency extension was passed with massive Democratic Party support.Howls from the right-wing caucus seeking a knife fight over the DHS bill could be heard across Capitol Hill. And moderates are equally outraged that the GOP has been hijacked by the ""delusional wing of the party,"" as Rep. Pete King (R-NY) said.There are now even rumors of a coup against Boehner as the anti-immigrant radicals of his party are still incapable of understanding the basic mechanics of how Congress works -- namely, that without 60 votes in the Senate, Republicans cannot simply dictate legislation.As Republican factions will continue to struggle this week with getting out of the DHS funding trap they themselves set, at this point seemingly incapable of advancing with a clean, long-term funding bill in the House in spite of the Senate's overwhelming, bi-partisan vote in favor of funding America's premier anti-terrorism agencies, the country looks on with a sinking feeling.Sure, Republicans, at least since President Reagan, have identified ""the"" problem as the government itself. That, of course, did not keep Reagan from working with Democrats on a slew of reforms, including extending the lives of Social Security and Medicare. For a man who grew up in the Depression, the idea of old people falling into poverty after retirement was an all-too-clear possibility for Reagan -- and Social Security had forever changed that grim reality of American society.But as a few snowballs rolling off a mountain tend to do, the anti-government sentiments unleashed by the Gipper have now become an avalanche, threatening the very fabric of the American social compact.Witness the awesomeness of Rep. Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) budget. While its attack on arithmetic is monumental, the incapacity to learn from 35 years of failed trickle-down policies that it displays is stunning. Cut taxes for the rich and the U.S. Treasury will overflow with new tax revenue -- except that has never happened. Under-invest in public education and people will be more educated, somehow. America has now gone from the No. 1 global ranking in public education outcomes to an objective disaster. Cut the safety net for the poor and people will make it, anyway -- yet the United States now only beats wealth-challenged Romania for highest per capita number of poor children of the top 35 developed nations in the world.And while these empirically challenged Tea Party policies would, in a free market, already be discredited and hounded out of the public debate for their sheer lack of efficacy, Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.), recently leading in the Iowa polls, will have to delay Wisconsin's debt payments in order to balance his trickle-down budget.Meanwhile, in Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback (R), a potential dark horse for the GOP nomination, has not only slashed more dollars from public education; he had to also raise taxes to fill the budget holes he created with the implementation of a full-frontal trickle-down Tea Party dream budget.Of course, it's anathema to Republicans to even utter, ""George W. Bush,"" but during Bush II's administration, we first saw the full display of proto-Tea Party policies that led the country to double its national debt while simultaneously tipping the national and global economies into a broad-scale financial collapse. Aside from that, Bush's tax cuts and erasing of regulations worked marvelously.So why is the free market failing so badly in consigning trickle-down and the broader Tea Party agenda into the dustbin of history? Short answer: There is no free market of ideas in the United States. You have to pay to play in our democracy now.The outsized influence of unregulated corporate and wealthy donor money that now lubricates American politics and policy-making has taken away the possibility to really debate and challenge Republican Party orthodoxy. In an unintentionally revelatory disclosure, anti-immigration hardliner Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), trying to justify the blocking of the DHS funding bill, told The Hill, ""If I was a donor to some of these senators that just won election and was told things would be different in a new Senate, I'd be pretty pissed. We put [Senate Minority Leader] Harry Reid [D-Nev.] back in charge of the Senate again?""The ""we"" in Huelskamp's declaration refers to GOP donors. Without even blushing, the congressman betrays his true priorities: the opinion of hefty wallets driving their private agendas through big donations to people like Huelskamp and the rest of the GOP.Conspicuously absent is any concern from the congressman about the voters -- or even the citizenry at large -- who could be put at risk should DHS lose its funding due to a Tea Party maneuver to destroy President Obama's immigration executive order, a stunt that has now failed spectacularly.This progression makes perfect sense. The Tea Party is a manufactured platform, created by Koch brothers money, executed by former GOP operatives, as well as Koch affiliates like Americans for Prosperity, and focused on electing a Congress that would reflect the will and priorities of special economic interests and their beneficiaries. The initial $12 million investment by the Koch machine into Freedomworks to get the ball rolling was a masterful exercise in Machiavellian pure power politics.Americans are paying close attention to the gruesome, yet fascinating spectacle of a Republican civil war that seems to have spread with winning control of Congress. As next week unfolds, voters will be treated to yet another display of their government flaying around as it tries to fulfill the most basic of its Constitutional functions -- funding critical national security agencies that protect the nation.And that should worry the real Republicans as their party's branding increasingly looks like the Whig Party's, pre-implosion."

The military bases remained, but the wording of the agreement was phrased in such a way that Andreas could claim that they were leaving! All the negotiating weapons the government had at its disposal went into putting on this show, so that Andreas could sell the agreement to his political supporters. Complete control over the media, coupled with a public opinion desperate for a sense of national independence, made the management of this reversal all the easier.Does this story sound familiar? SYRIZA used the write-down of the debt, the tearing up of the Memorandum and the ousting of the Troika as its main election slogans. All populist movements need a common enemy in order to be able to unite disparate audiences. For SYRIZA, the Memorandum and German dominance in Europe symbolized exactly what the military bases and American hegemony did for Andreas. The shift back to political reality came quickly for SYRIZA. Realizing that it was not possible for the country to move outside the EU framework without disastrous consequences, the government requested an extension to the existing program for four months, until the pending evaluation program is completed. This will be followed by the Greek government putting forth its own narrative regarding the strengths and viability of the Greek economy.In these types of situations, words start to acquire their own special meanings. The ""Troika"" was renamed the ""Institutions,"" the ""Memorandum"" has been retitled the ""Program,"" and the ""prerequisites"" are now known as the ""national reform plan."" The substance of these things, though, has not changed. Greece must implement specific actions that will be checked by its creditors so that it can get the money that it so badly needs. Only when these people are satisfied that the government's actions are not jeopardizing the fiscal health of the country and are not undermining those reforms that have already been completed will they release the remaining tranches of the program. The reality is that this government lost precious time and undermined the credibility of the country in the eyes of Europe, all in an attempt to justify its hard shift back to reality to its domestic audience. Wearing raised collars and untucked shirts is all fine and good, but trust is not built in the family of Europe by leaks and double-speak, all done just to show the domestic constituency how hard you are negotiating. Even the most experienced member of the Left, Manolis Glezos, immediately saw the government's attempt to ""rechristen the fish into meat."" Now that Lent is beginning, that phrase is quite appropriate.The truth is that the government missed a great opportunity. Europe, now more than ever, needs a persuasive alternative to counter the German insistence on austerity. Mr. Tsipras would have been in a position to offer that alternative, had he not made himself so vulnerable in the campaign with rhetorical jabs or had he immediately requested an extension of the existing program. Instead, he decided to partake in some shadowboxing for the viewing pleasure of the Greek public.Emphasis should have been given instead to a structured program with three pillars: the reduction of debt through guided changes, the reduction of excessively high primary surplus targets, and the implementation of a comprehensive program of reforms to improve the competitiveness of the real economy. The problem is that all of these are in direct conflict with the pre-election promises of SYRIZA and the expectations they stoked in the public. That is exactly what the first Papandreou government did, albeit with complete control over PASOK and a lot of money at its disposal.Unfortunately, extreme campaign rhetoric will always continue to follow political parties, even when they rise to power. We in the opposition would also do well to remember this, so that we do not find ourselves one day in the unfortunate position of having to practice similar verbal gymnastics.This post was originally published on HuffPost Greece and was translated into English."

Thomas/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60c98d8c410000ee1581279e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On February 1, 1960 four black students sat down at a segregated lunch counter I Greensboro, NC sparking one of Black America's largest waves of protest. By the end of February the sit-in movement had grown to thirty communities in seven states and by April had spread across the entire South, involving up to 50,000 participants. Over the next decade the leaders who emerged out of this wave of actions would carry out some of the most important campaigns of the Civil Rights movement -- from the Freedom Rides to the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party's challenge to racism of the Democratic Party. Eventually their work would help to topple the Jim Crow regime and launch the Black Power movement.  In the decade after the sit-ins, these new leaders would experience both incredible triumphs and crushing defeats. They would try different strategies and tactics for Black liberation from direct action to bring down segregation to voter registration to build Black political power. Underlying every new stage of the struggle was a deep dedication to breaking the chains of fear and internalized inferiority and transforming the conditions of violence and exploitation that limited the potential for the full flourishing of Black lives. For these leaders, personal liberation and social transformation were inseparable and the role of leadership was, at its heart, the practice of supporting everyday people in taking effective action to transform themselves and their conditions in the face of great odds and uncertain outcomes.  Today we talk about this style of personal and social transformation and this approach to leadership as transformative organizing. For the transformative organizers, leadership is understood more as a practice than a position, more a relationship than a role. Leadership is not simply a place in an organizational structure, it is a discipline and a path -- a calling to become powerful catalysts of and embodiments of transformation. In the context of Black organizing, we call this the path of Black mastery.  Each leader and moment in the history of the Black Freedom Movement offers rich lessons for us. However, as we reflect on the current movement moment, we think there are eight elements of Black mastery that are most relevant for us today: courage, compassion, authenticity, accountability, rigor, resilience, attention, and agility. We find it useful to group them into four pairs, where the element balance each other.  As poet and revolutionary Audre Lorde reminds us, courage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to act even when we are afraid. Compassion is the ability to understand, to feel deeply, both the suffering and the joy of others. It is the ability to literally feel the humanity of others and to act from that place. Social justice movements practice compassion and courage when they insist on the humanity of oppressed people and challenge society to respect that humanity.  But we also need to practice courage and compassion with ourselves and with each other. It takes courage and compassion to acknowledge our own weaknesses and breakdowns -- our own humanity as leaders and as a movement. We must learn how to work with both our strengths and our tender places.  When we are authentic, we are true to ourselves. In the face of repression and violence or the forces of cooptation, it is tempting not to be authentic. It can be difficult to acknowledge when we don't know something or when we've made a mistake. And for some of us who have been socialized not to speak or to dream, it can be difficult to confidently stand in our true vision and beliefs. But it is when we are authentic that others are moved, that others are able to feel and touch our humanity and connect more deeply to their own.  Accountability -- the willingness and ability to accept responsibility and to account for one's actions -- is the other side of this coin. Our actions and our words have consequences. As we learn to speak and act with authenticity we must also learn to speak and act with accountability.  To be rigorous is to be precise and disciplined and flows from accountability. When we understand and take responsibility for the consequences of our actions, we become more and more able to act with skill and precision. Black mastery requires us to hold ourselves and each other to rigorous standards.  At the same time, we must also cultivate our resilience. Resilience is the ability to restore our strength, health, and well-being after experiencing something difficult or traumatic. It flows from our ability to touch our joy and to practice connecting with the things that bring us to life and connection. Without resilience we burn out.  In many ways the ability to attend to the world around us and ourselves is the foundation of Black mastery. Attention allows us to stay in touch with what we care about as well as whats happening with others and the world around us. Conditions are always changing, especially in social movements, and attention is the skill that allows us to notice what's happening so that we can act effectively.  Finally, agility is the ability to move, to pivot and shift easily and quickly. Knowing that things have changed and that our movement or our leadership needs to shift isn't enough. We actually have to be able to move, to be nimble.It is not accidental that these elements reflect physical, emotional and feeling concepts. The reason being is that we will not simply mastermind our way into leadership but we must work to embody these elements for them to be recognized, and of service to our work and our people. This is the work of leadership development that is not found in a book or thinking differently but rather within our full body self - emotions, sensations, feelings and mental narratives.Like every discipline, every tradition, Black mastery is an intergenerational affair. No generation of leaders make themselves from scratch but they draw from what has come before them. We have drawn from our elders experiences who share our ethics of Black Mastery, low ego/high impact to build our leader-ful next moment.We will know that Black Lives Matter when each of us is supported in embodying Black mastery and our full leadership potential.This post is part of the ""Black Future Month"" series produced by The Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter for Black History Month. Each day in February, this series will look at one of 28 different cultural and political issues affecting Black lives, from education to criminal-justice reform.

Go home then'. What can you do in a world that works like this? Because there's a queue of people looking for work. If you don't like it, someone else will,"" he said in an unscripted change from the text of his speech.""It's hunger, hunger that makes us accept what they give us,"" he said.His remarks have a special resonance in Italy, where unemployment, particularly among young people, is running at record levels after years of economic recession.The cooperative movement in Italy, whose roots go back to 19th century workers' associations, have long had close ties to the Catholic Church, with credit services, agricultural and building co-ops forming an important part of the overall economy.Pope Francis said they could help find new models and methods that could be an alternative model to the ""throwaway culture created by the powers that control the economic and financial policies of the globalized world.""Perhaps mindful of a wide-ranging corruption scandal linked to some cooperatives in Rome last year, he attacked those who ""prostitute the cooperative name"".But his overall message was that economic rationale had to be secondary to the wider needs of human society.""When money becomes an idol, it commands the choices of man. And thus it ruins man and condemns him. It makes him a slave,"" he said.""Money at the service of life can be managed in the right way by cooperatives, on condition that it is a real cooperative where capital does not have command over men but men over capital,"" he said."
12,RELIGION,3 Ways Relics And Artifacts Can Help Us 'Find Jesus',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/finding-jesus-cnn-relics-artifacts_n_6775274.html,,2015-02-28,"An exact copy of the Shroud of Turin, the linen cloth that wrapped the body of Jesus Christ, is displayed at the chapel of the Cahtholic Armenian patriarchï¿½s residence in an east Beirut neighbourhood on September 30, 2010. The Shroud arrived in Beirut by the will of Nerses Bedros, the Armenian Catholic patriarch who after a pilgrimage to Turin last May decided to display permanently the replica at the Saint Elias Cathedral. AFP PHOTO/JOSEPH EID (Photo credit should read JOSEPH EID/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fbf32400003200572ba3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Why are we so fascinated with any historical artifact — relics, as some call them — associated with Jesus?Even the most suspect claim of a “lost” gospel or an “explosive” archaeological find that purports to shed light on the man from Galilee can generate a media frenzy, and gives believers — or skeptics — fresh evidence to try to finally win their argument while leaving their foes on the defensive.Think of the recent “gospel” that seemed to show Jesus had a wife — and she was, of all people, the scandalous Mary Magdalene. Or the discovery a few years ago of an ancient papyrus that depicted Judas as the hero of the gospel story, not the great betrayer. Or, a few years before that, the revelation of a bone box with “brother of Jesus” inscribed on the top.The argument in these purported blockbuster discoveries is that everything we’ve ever known about Christianity is probably false and that there has been a massive, millennia-long cover-up to hide the real truth. Remember “The Da Vinci Code”? There’s a reason that fiction sounded like fact to a lot of people.Yet in spite of the overblown claims and dodgy artifacts floating around out there, genuine artifacts and solid historical research still provide the best window into that long-ago world and the best chance to figure out who Jesus really was, and what he meant.That’s also the idea behind CNN’s “Finding Jesus: Faith. Fact. Forgery,” a new, six-part series that we created (and book of the same name that we co-authored). “Finding Jesus” premieres this Sunday (March 1) on CNN and runs weekly through Easter Sunday, with each episode examining many of the very objects that have so often made for eye-popping headlines:The Shroud of Turin (March 1); the bones of John the Baptist (March 8); the gospel of Judas (March 15); James, the brother of Jesus (March 22); the True Cross (March 29); and the gospel of Mary Magdalene (April 5).Why focus on scraps of papyrus and splinters of wood, bone fragments and bits of ancient linen?Obviously, objects associated with a famous person or a loved one (Jesus can qualify as both) have a great allure on their own. They provide a direct physical connection with the past, allowing us to reach across the chasm of time and space. It doesn’t matter if it’s a lock of hair or an old baseball card or something even more mundane, like an expired credit card that once belonged to the late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain — which is now on the auction block.But artifacts related to Jesus, and the historical research around them, do three critical things:  ONE: They educate with actual facts“Test everything; retain what is good,” St. Paul wrote to a community of early Christians. It pays to do the same with the various claims of amazing breakthroughs. Some can indeed provide a valuable new perspective on the Jesus of history, and even those that do not turn out to be what they seem can, through the process of testing and debunking, take readers more deeply into the reality of the first-century church.That’s a good thing, and necessary: Christians can be woefully ignorant about their own scriptures, and just 45 percent of all Americans can name the four Gospels. (They’re Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, if you’re taking notes.)In the absence of information, any argument or conspiracy theory can gain traction. You say Jesus was married? Well, why not? And Mary Magdalene was a prostitute? Who can prove that she wasn’t?  TWO: They provide contextThe truth is that we know precious little about Jesus, mainly because the Gospel writers and even his immediate followers were interested in promoting his message, not writing historical biography.For example: None of his contemporaries told us what he looked like, and no one even speculated about his appearance for centuries. All that great art is simply conjecture, which is one reason the image on the Shroud of Turin is so tantalizing. Could it be the original selfie? There are even arguments over exactly what language Jesus spoke, and whether he was literate.Remember, after the Christmas narrative, there is only one passing mention of the young Jesus in one Gospel, when he was 12. The next we hear of him, he is a 30-year-old man, emerging as the Messiah and a miracle worker, and the Son of God. That’s a huge gap, and that vacuum has sucked in all manner of theories about Jesus as a teenager or maybe a 20-something wandering the world in search of himself.Some of the so-called New Atheists are even resurrecting the old chestnut that Jesus never existed and was an invention of a group of first-century Jews.That theory is widely discredited, but it shows that for both believers and skeptics, learning about the historical context of first-century Judaism is more important than ever. That knowledge is the frame that outlines the subject. The more we know about John the Baptist — who was essentially Jesus’ mentor — or Judas Iscariot, the more we know about Jesus.Relics are, ironically, a rare patch of common ground between skeptics and believers, a place where science and religion can come together, not as foes but as pilgrims on a shared journey — wherever it leads.  THREE: They provide a reality checkThe so-called “quest” for the historical Jesus has been going on for centuries, since European scholars began applying critical methods to holy writ once considered beyond question. The research has ebbed and flowed — we are in the midst of the third great “quest,” some say — and academics and theologians have produced much of value, and have also gone down many a dead end.Perhaps the greatest peril for scholars, and Bible-reading believers, is that we wind up creating Jesus in our own image.In recent decades, Jesus has been held up as everything from a proto-Marxist to an anti-tax Tea Partier. For others, he is the model of a simple-living, slow-food-loving peasant, or he is a model salesman who can teach you to be successful in business. Still others depict Jesus as a freedom-loving zealot or a detached Greek philosopher, or gay, or happily married — with kids, of course.But these distortions actually make the quest to recover the Jesus of history — and of faith — more urgent.Artifacts and archaeology can be a way to take us out of ourselves, to transport us to a time and place not our own, in hopes of discovering something about Jesus that is not filtered through the lens of our own desires.  (David Gibson, a national reporter for Religion News Service, and author and filmmaker Michael McKinley are co-authors of the new book “Finding Jesus” and creators of the CNN series). "

Scott Walker (R) is doubling down on claims that the strongest foreign policy move in his lifetime was former President Ronald Reagan's decision to fire 11,000 air traffic controllers.In 1981, almost 13,000 air traffic control employees walked off the job when contract negotiations between the federal government and the controllers union stalled. Reagan claimed the strike was illegal and demanded the air traffic controllers return to work; when some 11,000 did not, he fired them. Walker, who has long idolized Reagan and previously lauded the former president's standoff with air traffic control, on Saturday called it ""the most significant foreign policy decision of my lifetime"" during an address at the Club for Growth's winter meeting in West Palm Beach, Florida.""It sent a message not only across America, it sent a message around the world,"" Walker said, according to The Washington Post, claiming the action showed foreign allies and enemies that ""we weren't to be messed with.""Walker made almost identical comments during a January MSNBC appearance, where he claimed there were documents that proved the Soviet Union treated the U.S. differently following the standoff.""Years later, documents released from the Soviet Union showed that that exactly was the case,"" he said. ""The Soviet Union started treating [Reagan] more seriously once he did something like that. Ideas have to have consequences.

""It's utter nonsense,"" Jack Matlock, Reagan's ambassador to the Soviet Union, told PolitiFact. ""There is no evidence of that whatever.""And yet, Walker has committed to highlighting his own dealings with unions to prove his ability to take on foreign threats, like the Islamic State. During a Thursday address at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Walker touted his confrontation with right-to-work protesters in Wisconsin as proof he can take on threats from the Middle East.""If I can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,"" Walker said Thursday, after being asked how he would stand up to the Islamic State.Walker made the same comparison earlier this month at a dinner for prominent conservative donors, according to CNBC's Larry Kudlow.""Walker argued that when Reagan fired air traffic controllers (from the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization) over their illegal strike, he was sending a message of toughness to Democrats and unions at home as well as our Soviet enemies abroad,"" Kudlow wrote of Walker's remarks.

Pioneer, under investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, generated $127 million from the contract over the past two years, according to its annual report to investors on Friday. It has worked for the Education Department since 1997.With the number of borrowers in default now more than 7 million as federal student debt surpasses $1.1 trillion, the contracts have become among the most lucrative Education Department offerings, generating hundreds of millions of dollars a year for debt collectors tasked with recouping cash from borrowers who have defaulted on their federal student loans. In November 2013, Dwight Vigna, the Education Department official who oversees the program, told the financial industry that debt collectors stood to reap nearly $5.8 billion in commissions over the four-year period ending in 2016.But the department's debt collection program has also become a headache for Education Secretary Arne Duncan, as plaintiffs' lawyers, state and federal regulators and borrower advocates have demanded changes after discovering evidence that borrowers in distress were given false information or otherwise mistreated when they tried to make good on their debts.The Education Department said Friday that its decision was prompted by what it described as ""high incidences of materially inaccurate representations"" to borrowers that it discovered in reviews spanning several months. The five debt collectors, according to the department, misled borrowers about their options to get out of default, the resulting benefits to their credit reports and collection fees. Misleading borrowers about their defaulted debts may violate federal fair debt collection laws.""Every company that works for the department must keep consumers’ best interests at the heart of their business practices by giving borrowers clear and accurate guidance,"" said Education Undersecretary Ted Mitchell. ""It is our responsibility -- and our commitment -- to uphold the highest standards of service for America’s student borrowers and consumers.""The admission that some of its contractors likely violated borrowers' rights under fair debt collection laws will likely lead to increased scrutiny of the department's debt collectors, oversight of them, and how borrowers may have been harmed.The Education Department didn't respond to queries beyond an emailed news release.The Treasury Department is among federal agencies that have been concerned by the Education Department's debt collection program. The Huffington Post reported in November that the Treasury would soon take some student borrowers' accounts away from the Education Department's contracted debt collectors and give them to federal workers in a pilot program that may cut out student loan middlemen.The other companies to lose their contracts are: Coast Professional, Enterprise Recovery Systems, National Recoveries, and West Asset Management. The Federal Trade Commission in 2011 accused West Asset of violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The two sides settled for $2.8 million, which at the time was the FTC's largest civil penalty in a debt collection case.“Student loan debt collectors that mislead and harm consumers must be held accountable,"" said Rohit Chopra, the consumer bureau's top official overseeing student loans. ""Today, the Education Department took an important step by winding down contracts with five debt collectors for not playing by the rules. The CFPB will continue to work with our federal and state partners to root out bad actors and ensure that debt collectors are treating student borrowers fairly. Consumers need clarity, not confusion.""The Education Department said it would transfer accounts from affected companies, including Pioneer, to its other debt collectors, and would officially terminate its relationship with the companies once all accounts have been moved over. The move is the department's most forceful response in years to alleged misdeeds by its student loan contractors.The National Consumer Law Center, which advocates on behalf of borrowers, has previously criticized the department's debt collectors for routinely violating borrowers' consumer rights under federal and state laws. Deanne Loonin has been among the borrower advocates most critical of the department's relationship with allegedly-sloppy debt collectors, and has urged the department for years to terminate its contracts as a result.Federal watchdogs at the Government Accountability Office and the Education Department's inspector general have repeatedly criticized the department's oversight of contractors. In a report last year, the GAO found that the Education Department documented apparent violations of federal debt collection laws by its contractors, yet did nothing about it. The Education Department's inspector general has faulted the department for ignoring both borrowers' complaints and its own debt collectors' potential violations of federal consumer laws.In its annual report to investors on Friday, Navient indicated it disagreed with the Education Department's decision. ""We are engaged with [the department] to learn more about their decision and address any questions or concerns they may have,"" the company said.The Education Department's decision is likely to come as a shock to the debt collection industry and the financiers who bankroll the companies. Pioneer, Enterprise and Coast have been among the Education Department's highest-ranking debt collectors, according to the department.""After years of hearing complaints from borrowers of abusive treatment, we are relieved to hear that the Education Department has taken this first step to protect borrowers and hold the companies they contract accountable,"" said Chris Hicks, an organizer who leads the Debt-Free Future campaign for Jobs With Justice, a Washington-based nonprofit."

His appeal fell on deaf ears and voters swept the previous conservative premier from power.Portugal will also have elections after the summer but no anti-austerity force as potent as Syriza or Podemos has so far emerged there.In an interview published before Tsipras made his speech, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho denied that Portugal had taken a hard line in negotiations on the Greek deal at the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers.""There may have been a political intention to create this idea, but it is not true,"" he told the Expresso weekly newspaper.Passos Coelho aligned himself with euro zone governments which have called for policies to promote economic growth but without trying to walk away from austerity as in Greece.""We were on the same side as the French government, with the Italian and Irish governments. I think it's bad to stigmatize southern European countries,"" he said. A VICTORY FOR GREECEPortugal had to take its own bailout in 2011 but left the program last year. Finance Minister Maria Luis Albuquerque said on Saturday Lisbon would start repaying its loans to the IMF next month, giving back 6 billion euros.This contrasts to Greece which remains in its EU/IMF program, almost five years and two bailouts after it had to seek international help.Tsipras has portrayed the Eurogroup deal as a victory for Greece, even though it meant extending the bailout program he had promised voters to scrap. He noted German lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives had attacked the Greek leadership when they approved the extension on Friday.""We have all watched the strong opposition within Angela Merkel's party which shows that unacceptable concessions have been made to Greece,"" he said.So far he has public backing. A poll conducted by the University of Macedonia for SKAI TV showed 56 percent of Greeks believed the extension had been a success, compared with 24 percent who said it represented a failure.Ireland's finance minister has said Athens must negotiate a third bailout when the extension expires in June - something Tsipras denied on Friday.Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis called into question a major debt repayment Greece must make to the European Central Bank this summer, after acknowledging Athens faces problems in meeting its obligations to international creditors.

On a recent trip to Tampa my time consisted of some quality pampering as I enjoyed two very different types of spas and amazing meals each experience with its own unique impressions.  First things first, the perfect vehicle for a Tampa jaunt is definitely the 2015 BMW M4 and if you are scratching your head wondering where the M4 came from, never fear BMW aficionados; it's really the M3 with a new name and slightly updated look minus a few doors and with a headier sense of style.With a price tag of $83,325 all those places ""in"" Tampa where you can see and be seen will just look better when you are behind the wheel of this BMW, competition being the Lexus RC F, Audi RS 5 and the Porsche Boxster S. Since the M4 is a new model there are no changes, just part of the new 4 Series coupe with a turbocharged engine and lots of body armor, aka aluminum. Since the whole naming thing can get quite confusing on the makes and models, let's run down the idea behind the 3 and 4 naming approach that BMW is touting these days playing with the evens and odds.If it's a sedan it's going to be an odd number and if it's the sexier coupe or convertible it will sport an even number, pretty easy after all.I drove the coupe and that came well-equipped with the Executive Package offering a heated steering wheel, comfort access keyless entry, rearview camera, retractable headlight washers, park distance control and satellite radio. The 2015 BMW M3 and M4 are about 175 pounds lighter than earlier models, but the biggest change is under the hood where there is a S55 3.0-liter twin turbocharged inline six cylinder engine and it gives you 425 horsepower with 406 pound-feet of torque. There are two transmissions available the six-speed manual with a twin-plate clutch, stronger gears or the seven-speed dual-clutch automated manual. Also of importance is the fact that the M4 is about two inches wider than the 435i coupe. Overall, the cool option of Comfort, Sport or Sport+ modes means drivers gets to choose how to own the road with seamless effort.Inside and out, the BMW is a snazzy option for good times with an easy to drive attitude that will appeal to men and women who prefer to drive the best and now, let's hit the road and find out what snazzy stops we can find in the Tampa area. Tampa's Epicurean Hotel is good for not only a relaxing spa experience, but dining and it's the perfect location. Epicurean is located in South Tampa's SoHo district, which is these days the place to see and be seen in the city. Enjoy a few stops at the boutiques that line the streets and be hard pressed to determine what to decide for dinner. Very walkable and near Hyde Park where you can ride a bike or stroll down cobblestone streets remember the water is nearby too on Bayshore Boulevard. Epicurean's guest rooms are luxurious and chic, the restaurant offers fresh foods with a living wall that grows seasonal produce, however the spa is where I spent my time. Called Evangeline, the spa offers a variety of treatments from manicures and pedicures to massages and facials. Have the spa's sommelier help you create your own custom spa products to use during your treatment.  You can also stop in at the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club and the Indaba Spa, the sort of place that will remind you of old world Florida charm. Innisbrook, even without the spa, is an amazing story and it is recognized as a world class golf resort and the host of the PGA Tour's Transitions Championship. The owner, Sheila Johnson acquired the property in 2007 taking it to the next level with a stylish transformation that creates a relaxing and enjoyable environment for any type of guest to enjoy. The spa uses botanical products and offerings are diverse from facials, to body work to wraps and scrubs. The distinct water and gardens bring peace once you enter the spas domain and note the hints of tribal Africa, which I found stunning. After all, Indaba means gathering in Zulu and like the ancient African people who knew the importance of ritual and ceremony, so will you find that vibe here as well. Remember too, Tampa is home to the ""Original Cuban Sandwich,"" with Columbia Restaurant (the oldest restaurant in Florida) and Gaspar's Grotto located in Ybor City (where the sandwich was created) topping the list to find one of the best. While you are in Ybor City check out the men making hand-rolled cigars on Seventh Avenue (also named one of the 10 greatest streets in America in 2008). Even if you don't smoke cigars you are still watching a work of art and Ybor City was once known as the cigar capital of the world with 700 million hand-rolled cigars made a year during the good old days of the chic cigar. Other must stop in places include Ulele  offering everything from Oysters from the Gulf Coast to Okra Fries, Crab Mac & Cheese and Florida Jumpers (that's frog legs), the entrees include a variety of fish, of course, but also porterhouse, pork chops and duck. Rumor is the place is crowded every night and it's located on the new Tampa River walk just north of downtown offering what owners call ""a fusion of ingredients from Florida waters and land once home to many Native Americans.""Ava is a newly opened restaurant in Tampa serving up Italian that is traditional, handmade, and rustic and I was happy to see a brick oven pizza. Told by a credible source that this place was ""the place"" these days to hang out, Ava was definitely crowded when I was there. However, that did not stop the owner from coming over to chat, but even more I loved the food and I ordered my ""go to"" choice when I see a brick oven, the Margherita pizza. It did not disappoint. Check out the Le Meridien Tampa too, it's a new hotel that has been honored by Historic Hotels of America. It was recently opened and was once the Federal Courthouse in Downtown Tampa, after sitting empty for a long time it has now found new life as a lovely hotel featuring Bizou Brassiere, French inspired and the architecture has been saved so you can enjoy the history of this old building. The old courthouse had also been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was built in 1905 and the recent renovation cost about $26 million.

Elements are on different layers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31c4e2400003000974180.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Disruption seems to be proxy for the new normal today in nearly every industry. This is an uncomfortable state of affairs to many of us who are creatures of habit--which is most people, as scientists tell us that we are basically hardwired this way. Psychologists have given it a name: enculturation. Most of us would rather stay in our comfort zones than search for what is new, exciting and, just possibly, better.What happens, however, when disruption lands on our doorstep, either at home or work? Do we pretend for a while that this disruption will not affect us? If so, this strategy usually only lasts for a short time until we can no longer remain in denial. Then we either wait for the meteor to strike or find a way to innovate and create solutions.Organizations and entire industries are not so different from us in their response to change. Since many hiring managers hire in their own images, it's no wonder that companies and entire industries eventually find themselves facing a reality existing outside their comfort zones. ""Thinking outside the box"" workshops either have not been utilized or implemented over the past several decades.Two options exist for companies and industries that are caught in this inertia trap: either maintain the status quo and hope that no Apple, Google or Facebook comes onto the scene to disrupt it, or fully commit to pursuing innovative, creative ideas that may even disrupt their tried-and-true business model.It is tough to initiate the second approach, as we as a nation find it much easier to use the left-brain, linear and logical skills of strategic planning as it has been done for the past few decades, than to embrace the right-brain, intuitive ""big picture"" type of strategic thinking. (The higher up individuals are in the organizational chart, by the way, the more likely they are to opt to maintain the status quo.)In some organizations today, it is even difficult to call for brainsorming sessions for new ideas and products, as past history from these brainstorming sessions indicates that often they did not produce the promised results. A reluctance to throw out specific ideas in fear of retaliation from senior managers present can hamper the brainstorming process, along with potentially good ideas having been lost in the process because the participants were all talking at the same time. Once again, it's not easy to discard the complacent, habitualized, conventional thinking process and invent a new approach to brainstorming that will yield better results. I personally know that it can be done, however. I have facilitated sessions with both large and small, Fortune 500 and even global companies, where teams have activated neural pathways in their brains in a new, exciting way.Scared of leaving your comfort zone?  If so, here are 10 actions you can take to dislodge your organization from its conventional thinking rut.1. Identify and discuss the key problems your organization faces.2. Frame these key problems into questions.3. Send these questions to a disparate group of employees and customers to think about, and record their answers on paper.4. Invite this group into an Ideation session (an improved version of brainstorming where key issues can be resolved).5. Enlist the talents of a nonpartial, skilled problem solver to facilitate the process.6. Make the process fun, collaborative and outside conventional boundaries.7. Incorporate a strategic democratization by allowing participants to vote for the ideas they find most compelling.8. Build task forces around these ideas.9. Start small with pilot projects.10. Review, ratify and implement the big, transformational insights."

It is supported by Governor Scott Walker, a potential Republican presidential candidate.About 5,000 people gathered at the state capitol on Saturday, despite the frigid temperature of 16 degrees F (-9 C).

His support grew when he survived a union-backed recall election in 2012.The Wisconsin AFL-CIO organized Saturday's rally, which comes four years to the month after massive demonstrations at the state capitol by workers opposed to the limits then under consideration covering most unionized public sector workers.Union members chanted ""shame"" as senators voted narrowly to approve a right to work law on Wednesday and moved it to the state Assembly, also controlled by Republicans, where a public hearing is scheduled for Monday.Opponents cast the bill as an assault on organized labor and blue-collar workers that would limit union revenue and further erode the political power of organized labor. Supporters contend it could help to attract more jobs to Wisconsin.Mark Buss, 59, a hardhat-wearing union member from Appleton who was at Saturday's rally, said that in order to survive, unions must educate younger workers about the value of organized labor.""The bigger issue is equality for all workers,"" he said.The full Assembly is expected to vote on the measure within a week and Walker's spokeswoman has indicated he will sign a bill if it gets to his desk.
