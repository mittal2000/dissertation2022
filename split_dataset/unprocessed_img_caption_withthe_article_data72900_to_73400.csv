The normal heavyweights are here, of course -- the Kentucky, Duke, North Carolina -- but mid-major powers like Gonzaga and Wichita State have something to say about that. LSU, with its prized recruit, Ben Simmons, might be the trendy upstart to dethrone Kentucky in the SEC, or maybe it's Vanderbilt. Speaking of dethroning, can Iowa State or Oklahoma actually supplant Kansas atop the Big 12 and break the Jayhawks' remarkable 11 straight conference titles streak? We really don't know the answers, and maybe that's the beauty of it all.Here are the five reasons we are most excited about college hoops this season. (Also, read about my top ten seniors this season right here.)New Rule ChangesBy the time conference play rolls around, we're going to look back at the 35-second shot clock (installed in 1993) and wonder why it took so damn long to get rid of it. It was an ancient way to play the game, only rewarding bad offense and in turn, hurting good defense.The new clock is 30 seconds. For comparison, the NBA uses a 24-second clock. The five-second reduction may not seem like much, but it will make a dramatic difference in how teams play both ends of the floor. We can expect to see more zone defense and more pressing in an attempt to force offenses to shoot late in the clock.Luke Winn wrote a detailed piece for Sports Illustrated about the new clock's potential impact. It's not clear whether we'll see more scoring, but it is worth noting that scoring increased by more than 2 points per game when the new clock was used in the lower-level postseason tournaments last season. It could be a welcome way to address the glacial pace of games and sub-40 percent shooting.The other key rule change is increasing the restricted area from 3 feet from the basket to 4 feet. Even the most casual college hoops fan can grow weary of referees' block/charge dilemma. Block/charge is a very tricky call for refs, and this will help make it easier and in turn, clean up the game. Ideally, we will have less charges. Moreover, it destroys the game when a defender slides into the restricted area at the last minute for a ridiculous charge call that should never have been called. It's not a basketball play, bottom line, and the bigger restricted area will decrease such nonsense.The FreshmenYou never really know what to expect from freshmen, but one thing we don't have from this year's crop -- at least not yet -- is a clear-cut superstar: Think Jahlil Okafor, Karl Anthony-Towns, D'Angelo Russell. Perhaps LSU's Ben Simmons can become that guy, or maybe it's Kentucky's Skal Labissiere, Cal's Jaylen Brown or Maryland's Diamond Stone. Simmons, who was the consensus top recruit in the class, originally hails from Australia, but prepped in Florida. At 6 feet 9 inches, the lefty possesses tremendous athleticism and versatility, two terms we seem to continually hear from pro scouts. What we don't know ,however, is what position will be most natural for Simmons.Because of his ball-handling ability, Simmons excels on the perimeter, where he can use his size and power to pretty much make any play he wants. His 9-foot standing reach and 41 1/2-inch vertical will instantly help him on the glass, where LSU expects him to average double-digit rebounds as a freshmen. But whether or not he becomes a dominant collegian will depend on his offensive skills: Will defenses honor his perimeter shooting and will he consistently be able to get into the teeth of the paint and become a playmaker, both for himself and for others?The Maryland TransfersIt's been quite some time since we've seen so many talented transfers entering new programs. In fact, over 600 players transferred since the end of last season. The University of Maryland seems particularly poised to benefit from this.Perhaps the most notable new transfer is former Duke guard Rasheed Sulaimon, who has two years of eligibility remaining after being the first-ever player to be kicked off a team coached by Mike Krzyzewski. A former mega-recruit with the capacity to play both guard spots, Sulaimon -- teamed up with preseason All-American Melo Trimble -- helps provide Maryland with a premier backcourt. As a Duke freshman in 2012-13, Sulaimon averaged nearly 12 points per game. If the senior accepts his newfound role in College Park, he will make a massive impact right away.The other new transfer to know is 6-foot-9 forward Robert Carter, who transferred to Maryland from Georgia Tech. Carter has slimmed down and is a terrific scorer whose size and immense skill level present matchup problems all over the floor. Mark Turgeon's Terps are thinking Final Four and nothing else.Mid-Major PowerhousesThere is nothing mid-major about Gonzaga or Wichita State, both of which feature elite duos. The Zags boast a tremendous frontcourt, led by senior Kyle Wiltjer (a former transfer himself) and sophomore standout Domantas Sabonis. Wiltjer, at 6 feet 10 inches, is a matchup nightmare who can shoot the lights out (47 percent from the 3), but also beat you from either block, as well as the high post. Sabonis, much like his father, Arvydas Sabonis, has an excellent feel for the game. He is a splendid passer and a tenacious rebounder. At 6 feet 10 inches, with athleticism and a nasty streak, the surefire future pro should excel when Mark Few asks him to be a primary scoring weapon.The Shockers' strength, meanwhile, lies in their senior guards, triggerman Fred VanVleet and combo man Ron Baker. VanVleet is as complete a point guard as there is because of how well he controls the game, even when he's not scoring. His next step is to become a true knockdown shooter (he shot 37 percent from the 3 as a junior and 43 percent from the floor) while upping his scoring production (14 points per game as a junior). VanVleet is flanked by Baker, who had a very strong summer helping guide Team USA to a bronze medal in the Pan American Games. A former walk-on, Baker loves the big shot and is a legitimate two-way guy, a rarity these days in college hoops. Both will also be aided by transfer Conner Frankamp, a former top-4o recruit and Kansas guard who can really shoot it from deep.High-Profile Hot Seats Coaches come and go at this level -- more than 40 head coaches were either fired or left programs during the offseason -- but 2015 has a slew of high profile ones on the hot seat. Nobody is more notable than Tom Crean at Indiana. Crean has gotten a pass on recent struggles, on and off the floor, because of the job he's done in resurrecting one of the country's most prestigious programs, but his leash is tightening. There are no excuses this year: Crean has an elite point guard in senior Yogi Ferrell, as well as a blue chip freshman in forward Thomas Bryant. Josh Pastner at Memphis is another name to watch, because unlike Crean, Pastner is a first-timer who's gotten every pass since coming on board in 2009. The Tigers are rich in basketball tradition and are coming off their first empty postseason in 15 years. Moreover, Pastner's 2-4 NCAA Tournament record, with no Sweet 16s, doesn't exactly thrill boosters -- nor does the fact that his best player, first-team All-AAC forward Austin Nichols, transferred to Virginia. Travis Ford, at Oklahoma State, is also in trouble. The Cowboys have become a middling Big 12 team while somehow failing to benefit from one of the top home court advantages around at Gallagher-Iba Arena. Following a measly 18-14 season, Ford -- whose contract has a considerable buyout -- likely needs to return to the NCAA Tournament to save his job in Stillwater."

4,POLITICS,Mark Kirk's Supporters Are Using A Fake Minimum Wage Petition To Get Him On The Ballot,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-kirk-tammy-duckworth-senate_us_56450a91e4b045bf3dee7559,"A staffer for Tammy Duckworth caught them in the act, but the Kirk campaign denies involvement.",2015-11-13,There's some shady stuff going on with Mark Kirk's Senate campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585884501c00000a070ec832.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- David Applegate, a staff member for Rep. Tammy Duckworth's (D-Ill.) Senate campaign, was walking around at the Columbus Day parade in Chicago when he was approached by a woman with a clipboard.She asked him if he wanted to sign a petition. That was odd in itself, since Applegate was wearing a Duckworth campaign shirt, and the woman was wearing a campaign shirt for Sen. Mark Kirk (R), whom Duckworth is trying to unseat. It got weirder when she said the petition was about raising the minimum wage, an issue Kirk doesn't even support.Applegate, confused, said he worked for Duckworth, and the woman walked away. He saw her again later, standing with another woman who was also wearing a Kirk shirt and holding a clipboard. He got closer and looked over one of their shoulders. There were ""raise the wage"" stickers covering the tops of their petitions, but peeking out from underneath them was Mark Kirk's printed name.They weren't collecting signatures for a wage campaign; there isn't even an active wage campaign in Illinois right now. They were collecting signatures to put Kirk on the ballot for the March primary election. Applegate got a few pictures of the women before they noticed and took off to a nearby subway station. The photos are a bit blurry, but if you look closely at the upper left hand corner of the petition, you can see ""Mark Steven Kirk"" printed out as it appears on Kirk's petitions.""It was a pretty egregious act,"" he said. ""There were a lot of people out there. It was high-density, mostly Democrats.""Kirk campaign spokesman Kevin Artl said he has no idea who the women are and questioned the authenticity of Applegate's story.""Given the fact that the photo came from the Duckworth campaign and the individuals in the photo are not on our campaign staff, as Duckworth's campaign falsely alleged, we view this entire episode with great suspicion,"" Artl said.He noted that anybody can get copies of campaign petitions; in Kirk's case, you can download them straight off of his website. As for the Kirk shirts, Artl said the campaign gives out free t-shirts at events all the time.But if the women aren't affiliated with Kirk's campaign, why would they be collecting signatures for him in a Democratic stronghold, deceptively suggesting that he supports an issue popular among progressives?In order to submit their petitions to the Kirk campaign, the women would have to sign them and get them notarized. If the women aren't identified, the fraudulently collected signatures might end up being counted toward Kirk's total. Kirk and Duckworth both need between 5,000 and 10,000 signatures to get on the March ballot. They have 90 days to collect them.Duckworth beat Kirk in fundraising in the most recent quarter, raising $1.46 million compared to Kirk's $1.05 million. But Kirk, who has held his Senate seat since 2010 and served in the House of Representatives before that, has $3.62 million in cash on hand compared to Duckworth's $2.8 million.An early poll showed Duckworth with an advantage, but found that she remains mostly unknown in the state.Also on HuffPost:"

Martin O'Malley at the first presidential debate in October. It will fall to Clinton at the debate on Saturday to explain why her $12 an hour wage goal makes more sense than $15.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56450b22290000da004dce48.jpeg?cache=jtHmkm5cqj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At this week's Republican primary debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Neil Cavuto went there with his first question:Candidates, as we gather tonight in this very august theater, just outside and across the country, picketers are gathering as well. They’re demanding an immediate hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Just a few hours ago, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed doing the same for all state workers, the first governor to do so.For the ""Fight for $15"" movement, it was a big moment -- their ongoing activism had landed them, if not on the debate stage, then in the primetime spotlight, with Cavuto bringing the issue of working-class economics to the fore before the evening's opening pomp had fully burnt off and pressing the candidates on whether they were ""sympathetic to the protesters' cause."" As it turned out, this assemblage was not amenable to the idea of raising the minimum wage, preferring instead to enunciate their common fears over the potential for job losses. This is not an unreasonable premise, economically speaking, but because the GOP candidates were so uniform in their responses, a wider discussion on the trade-offs between wage increases and employment never took off.But during Saturday's Democratic debate, that could be a different story. On this week's ""So That Happened,"" reporters Arthur Delaney and Jessica Schulberg help discuss this hot-button issue ahead of the Democratic candidates' second meeting. (Discussion begins at 45:18 in the recording below.)As you might expect, the remaining Democratic candidates -- former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- all favor an increase in the minimum wage. But as to the extent to which they'd provide a boost in take-home pay, there is just enough divergence to make the discussion more interesting, and the stakes much higher.The Fight For $15 activists know that Sanders is fully in their corner: He took to the streets with them this past week, and perhaps more importantly has put his name to a bill that would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.O'Malley, too, has come out in favor of a $15 minimum, touting his successful effort as the governor of Maryland to raise the state minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour.It will fall then to Clinton to wade into the weeds and explain why her backing of a $12 minimum wage is what's best. In a way, Clinton has already begun erecting the conceptual framework for her argument, having announced herself as a ""progressive who likes to get things done"" -- contrasting Sanders' revolutionary zeal with her own skill at working within institutions and knowing where the limits are. Her case: The ""more ambitious proposal of $15 wouldn't be realistic on Capitol Hill.""The irony, of course, is that successfully making this argument might take considerably more ambition and effort than just enunciating support for the protest movement.The minimum wage is just one key issue for Democrats that has bloomed with new salience in the days ahead of the debate. This week, the Senate once again threw barriers in the way of closing the Guantanamo Bay internment camp -- one of President Barack Obama's oldest unfulfilled campaign promises. This means there's a good chance that the three Democrats on the stage Saturday night might have this problem passed on to them.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Adriana Usero and Peter James Callahan, with assistance from Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.

Good. Illegal? Bad.""",2015-11-13,"Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) addresses the Sunshine Summit in Orlando, Fla., Friday Nov. 13, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) isn't going to stand for opponent Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) painting him as moderate on immigration. On Friday, as Rubio insisted the two share similar stances on immigration, Cruz laid out a plan to increase deportation, end birthright citizenship, build a border wall and restrict even legal immigration.""Listen, the commonsense principles that most of us understand and most Americans agree with on immigration are not complicated,"" he said in a speech in Florida. ""It's legal? Good. Illegal? Bad.""He saved most of his venom for undocumented immigrants and those who want to allow them to stay in the U.S., insisting border-crossers may be terrorists or disease-ridden and that ""amnesty"" would drastically change the safety of the country and the world. Why? Because he said allowing undocumented immigrants to gain citizenship would put more Democrats in power.""If you support amnesty, you are supporting our national debt growing and growing and growing and growing and bankrupting our kids and grandkids,"" he said. ""If you support amnesty, you're supporting the Democratic party's assault on religious liberty, assault on our Second Amendment, assault on our privacy. If you're supporting amnesty, you're supporting Common Core that the big-government Democrats are trying to force on our schools."" The ills of ""amnesty"" would not stop in the U.S., Cruz said. ""If you're supporting amnesty, you're supporting the Obama-Clinton abandoning of the nation of Israel,"" Cruz continued. ""If you're supporting amnesty, you're supporting the Obama-Clinton weakness and appeasement to radical Islamic terrorists. ... If you are supporting amnesty, you are supporting the Ayatollah Khamenei having nuclear weapons in Iran."" He said those political motives are why Democrats support immigration reform. But in doing so, he made the case for excluding people based at least in part on the assumption they wouldn't vote for Republicans -- an argument that is fundamentally tied to ethnicity, because most undocumented immigrants are Latino or Asian, and most Latinos and Asians support Democrats.Cruz argued that it doesn't make him anti-immigrant to criticize unauthorized immigration, or legal immigration if it takes away American jobs. He said he wants to improve the legal immigration system and praised ""Americans by choice,"" as former President Ronald Reagan called legal immigrants.But his plan was also restrictive of legal immigration, a change from a politician who once proposed increasing the number of H1-B worker visas. He acknowledged that fact in his speech, but said he has since determined the program is being exploited. Cruz said he would stop the government from issuing those visas for 180 days to conduct an investigation into abuses. More broadly, Cruz in a written plan called for halting increases in legal immigration ""so long as work-force participation rates remain below historical averages."" He said his administration would ensure that legal immigrants do not receive government benefits, and railed against the idea of admitting ""Syrian Muslim refugees"" who he said could be terrorists. Children born in the U.S. would not be Americans unless their parents were, he said, a policy that would require changing the 14th Amendment. Cruz did not give many specifics about how he would deal with the estimated 11.3 million undocumented immigrants already in the country, other than to say they would not be allowed deportation relief like that extended by President Barack Obama, and to say that more of them should be deported. Republicans such as Donald Trump have called for all undocumented immigrants to be driven out, while others, such as Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich have said such a plan is impractical. Cruz didn't say he would deport everyone, but he also didn't mention whether some people would be allowed to remain in the U.S. legally, as he has before. His campaign did not respond to a request for clarification on how he'd prioritize deportations, if at all. But he did say he would deport criminals and end so-called sanctuary policies in jurisdictions that don't fully cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Senate could vote next week on a Cruz-backed bill that would penalize those jurisdictions."

The Google self-driving cars operate under the Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Definition per 385.5 of the California Vehicle Code and can only be operated on roadways with speed limits at or under 35 mph. In this case, it was lawful for the car to be traveling on the street as El Camino Real is rated at 35 mph.""According to 22400(a) of the California Vehicle Code, ""No person shall drive upon a highway at such a slow speed as to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic, unless the reduced speed is necessary for safe operation, because of a grade, or in compliance with law."" However, in this case, the Google car was in compliance with another law.The Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Definition classification cited above means the law sees them differently than normal automobiles. They are subject to a different set of rules, including the regulation that prohibits them from operating on roadways with speed limits higher than 35 miles per hour.Therefore, the car committed no violation, and the officer, therefore, did not write a ticket for its slow speed, CNN reports.However, the officer did issue a warning for impeding traffic, as the slow speed was apparently blocking the flow of traffic.In a statement posted yesterday on the company's Google+ page, Google stated it intentionally keeps its cars at low speeds.""We’ve capped the speed of our prototype vehicles at 25 mph for safety reasons. We want them to feel friendly and approachable, rather than zooming scarily through neighborhood streets.""""After 1.2 million miles of autonomous driving (that’s the human equivalent of 90 years of driving experience), we’re proud to say we’ve never been ticketed!""Google's self-driving cars are connected to human drivers who can help if a car does get pulled over, according to a rep from the Mountain View Police, via Twitter.In the past year, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has reported eight traffic incidents involving Google's self-driving cars. However, in May of this year, Google's Chris Urmson, director of the self-driving car program, posted a blog saying that, in the six years since the launch of the self-driving car project, there had been 11 accidents, resulting in no injuries. He also said in every one of those incidents, the accidents were caused by the other driver.A study from the University of Michigan, released in October, confirmed no accidents involving self-driving cars were caused by the cars themselves, but also stated the vehicles appear to have a higher crash rate per million miles traveled than cars with drivers.

That's considered progress.,2015-11-13,Fortune 1000 companies are moving closer to having women hold 20 percent of seats on their boards of directors.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5645ea95290000d7004dcea5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is, alas, progress: Women currently hold nearly 19 percent of board seats on the Fortune 1000 companies tracked by a nonprofit advocacy group called 2020 Women on Boards, up 1 percentage point from 2014.That means the nation’s largest corporations are closing in on the group’s modest goal: that all U.S. companies have a board of directors with at least 20 percent women by the year 2020. The group estimates they'll exceed that goal. As a reminder, since some people like to list females as a minority, women make up about half of the world’s population. At this rate they'll get to 50/50 in the year 2046.“This is something that moves very slowly,” Malli Gero, 2020’s president and co-founder, told The Huffington Post. She noted that since the group’s founding in 2011, the percentage of women on boards has climbed a full percentage point every year. “That may not sound like a lot to you, but a decade earlier, zero progress was being made,"" she said.Women hold 18.8 percent of the board seats at the 842 companies tracked, up from 17.7 percent last year and 14.6 percent in 2011. The index tracks gender representation on the 2010 Fortune 1000 list. It no longer analyzes 1,000 companies since some have fallen off the list over the years.Seventy-five of the companies tracked have no women on their board -- including Kodak, makeup company Coty and shoe company Skechers. You can search through a database of about 2,000 public and private companies on the nonprofit’s website here. “It’s not OK to have zero gender diversity,” said Gero, who noted that her group focuses on creating change within those companies.Typically, it’s the smaller and younger companies -- those at the bottom of Fortune’s rankings -- that struggle the most to diversify.After Facebook went public in 2012 with no women on its board of directors, Gero’s group sprang into action. In a blog post and interviews they called attention to the oversight and asked Mark Zuckerberg to at least appoint Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to the board. The news was widely covered.Facebook shareholders also spoke up. ”We are disappointed that the Facebook board will not have any women members,” wrote Anne Sheehan, a shareholder and director of corporate governance for a California pension fund for the state's teachers, in a letter to Zuckerberg. ""This is particularly glaring in view of the fact that Facebook is going public at a time when there is clear evidence that companies with diverse boards perform far better than the companies with more homogenous boards.""Ultimately, Zuckerberg appointed Sandberg. Eventually they put another woman on the Facebook board. Now two of eight directors are women, meeting 2020s goal of 20 percent.Some shareholders are increasingly pushing for board diversity, giving more weight to advocacy groups such as 2020. Urban Outfitters' CEO initially resisted calls from shareholders to diversify its board -- before ultimately capitulating and putting up two. (One was the CEO's wife.) Rival Abercrombie & Fitch put two women on its board last year after activist investors started making noise about the issue.Correction: Abercrombie & Fitch already had two women on its board last year before it put up two more, for a total of four women. A previous version of this article said four women were placed on the board last year. "

Squibb had a sesame bagel and cream cheese in front of her, and that's all she needed to survive a morning of phone interviews for her latest film, ""Love the Coopers."" Oscar nominees, they're just like us.In the new ensemble holiday dramedy, Squibb plays the uncouth Aunt Fishy, a warmhearted dementia patient spending Christmas with her nephew (John Goodman) and his wife (Diane Keaton) and family (Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin, Marisa Tomei, Ed Helms, the list goes on). It's the latest on a lengthy list of film and television bit parts that Squibb has done since her 2014 accolades for ""Nebraska,"" which made her one of the oldest Oscar nominees in history.Now 86, Squibb has been in the business for decades, starting out on Broadway and later establishing herself with movies like ""Scent of a Woman"" and ""About Schmidt,"" as well as guest roles on such shows as ""Ghost Whisperer"" and ""The Young and the Restless."" This weekend brings another rite of passage for the affectionate actress: a Christmas movie. Every star has to be in one at some point or another; it's practically written into the SAG bylaws. So we chatted with Squibb about ""Love the Coopers,"" how an Oscar nomination changed her life and the worst audition of her career.Does ""Love the Coopers"" remind you of your own family at all?Oh, yes, with all the different people trying to be so desperately happy. Also, it reminded me of the food thing because everybody always brought what they were known for making, and you had to acknowledge that, of course. Sometimes my family overwhelmed me and I would go hide in a closet. I truly did.Was that when you were growing up, or is it a more recent phenomenon?Oh, no, I don’t hide in closets anymore. This was when I was growing up. Sometimes my family, both sides, were a little flamboyant and they were just a little too much sometimes.How do you view the roles you’ve been offered since “Nebraska”? We’ve seen you play the ornery grandma who’s stuck in her ways a few times now.What’s kind of wonderful now is I don’t do everything that I’m offered. Really, it’s the script that makes my decision for me as to whether I’m going to do something now. And the people. God knows if you know you’re going to be working with good actors, then that is a joy and you know that you’re going to enjoy it and want to do it. That was one thing about this: the quality of actors and the [director, Jessie Nelson,] who was great. That made a big difference for it. Otherwise, I do a lot of TV where I enjoy the shows or I would like to work on the shows or something like that. I still will do guest spots on shows that I really like a lot.One of those is ""Getting On,"" which is one of the best shows on TV.  I shot their last season. I think I’m on the fifth episode. They just started again last Sunday, so after five weeks of that, I’ll be back on. That will mean I’ve shot every season of it.Your character in “Love the Coopers,” as was the case with “Nebraska,” “Getting On” and “Girls,” is pretty undignified. How do you compare that to the world of Broadway, which is often seen as being more classy and regal?Well, the thing is, I was always a character actress. I was never an ingénue or a leading lady. I did leads in some things, but they were still a character role. It hasn’t been all that much different. I played a stripper in “Gypsy” and one of the girls in “The Boy Friend” for a long, long time. It’s a grown-up version, really, I think. But to me, you see, I think they’re each different. When I read a script, it’s what they’re telling me about this person that’s fascinating.Now that you've had some time to process the whole thing, what do you make of your Oscar experience? After so many years in the business, it must have been odd to hear ""Nebraska"" called your breakout role.Well, I’ll tell you something. I have always felt that I have broken rules, and I think that’s what I did out here. It was amazing for someone my age, never having gotten an Oscar nomination before. People would say, “Oh, nothing would happen with that.” I never even thought it would. It was just a part of the process that we were going through. Our first thing was Cannes. That was the first big thing that we were all together at, and immediately they were talking about Bruce and I and the film being Oscar material. That’s the first I had ever seen it in print or heard people say it. I just sort of accept my life and what happens. I was thrilled. It was a great experience to have, and just the fact of the nomination and all of these different awards -- that meant a lot to me.The logical assumption is that an Oscar nomination is a huge boon to anyone's career. Do you feel like everything changed after yours?Very much so. For one thing, I don’t audition anymore. People offer me roles. Auditions never frightened me. In fact, sometimes it was great fun to just go in and throw something out where you felt, ""This is what it should be."" So it wasn’t a question of, “Oh, thank God I don’t have to do that anymore,” but it’s steadily become people thinking, “Oh, June Squibb can do this. I will ask her if she will do this for me.” It’s a whole different area you're dealing with there.Is that how “Love the Coopers” entered your life?Yes, Jessie asked me to do it. We actually talked because, as written, there isn’t very much there. She kept assuring me that we would find things. We did find a lot, I felt. She came up with some things, I came up with things, like the fact that I had the family dog beside me. All of these different things happened and became Aunt Fishy, and it was not in the script as such.With a big ensemble movie like this, are you given the whole script before taking the part, or do you only see your bits? Oh, you’re given the whole script for a feature. I think Woody Allen is the only one who gets away with not doing that.Diane Keaton could be your sister. What do you make of the fact that she's playing your niece? [Laughs] Yeah, I never thought much about it. I just knew I was playing John’s aunt by marriage. That, to me, was my link to the family. That was important to me that I knew that, but the rest of them were because of John. Now that you no longer have to audition, what do you consider your best and worst auditions?I think my best audition, truly, was when I got “Gypsy.” I brazenly said that I could do toe-dancing and I couldn’t. I was a dancer, but I didn’t work on my toes. The stage manager knew it and said, “June, what are you doing here?” I should say I was originally called in for ""La Plume de Ma Tante"" -- they were replacing someone who did do the toe-dancing. I was very brazen about it, like, “Of course I can do this.” He said, “You can’t do this.” I said, “Yes, I can.” Well, luckily, before I had to prove anything, they were looking for a person for “Gypsy.” The stage manager said he wanted to see me dancing to strip music. Again, I didn’t know what that was. I didn’t know what to do, but I went downstairs and a dancer friend of mine was down there. She showed me some tips and things, and I did that and got it. I think my worst audition was when, for some reason, I decided to sing a song never looking forward, but looking sideways. It was awful. Why did you do that?I have no idea! I did things like that when I was young. It was for a musical. I think it was in stock somewhere. I just thought, “I’m going to do this.” I was sort of fearless all through that period.I guess you recovered because you’ve worked with such great people over the years: Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Woody Allen, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Gene Hackman. I know you’ve worked with fantastic women, too, but the faces of most of your movies have men. You’re right. You’re exactly right.Do you ever look around and say, “Where are the women?”Well, when I worked with Gene Hackman, that was “Welcome to Mooseport,” and Maura Tierney was in it, and she’s wonderful. And Marcia Gay Harden was in it, and she’s wonderful. I just worked with her on “Code Black.”Of course, but Gene Hackman is the face of “Welcome to Mooseport.” Have you ever wished more of your projects revolved around women?Well, I think it's Diane in this one. I adore her. She is a wonderful actress and just a dear person, and I’m just thrilled to know her. It was a good relationship. We enjoyed each other, and we’ve seen each other since. It’s been great fun. But you’re right -- most of my experiences have been with very strong male actors. Do you chalk to that up to the way the industry works?Well, we all know that every script has two women and 15 men, but it is interesting that most of the films I’ve done have been with very strong leading men. Did you know that “Welcome to Mooseport” was going to be Gene Hackman’s last movie when you were making it?No. I’ve been told since that there were probably some health problems, but I don’t know that for sure. I think it was difficult for him and being out of town and so many things -- and he has this gorgeous, lovely wife who was with him. I think it’s still difficult for him. Have you gotten to speak to him since?No, I haven’t. I saw him the day that we broke and we said goodbye to each other. I haven’t seen him since. I don’t think anyone has, though. I think he’s living in the South somewhere.We’ve been talking about all these men, but let’s not discount your spot on this season of “Mom."" You got to work with Allison Janney, Anna Faris and Ellen Burstyn, which couldn’t have been too bad. How did that come into your life?Chuck Lorre called my agent and said he’d written a script. I don’t know that he called, but someone from his office, perhaps. Somehow they got in touch and said that as he was writing it he thought of me. I’ve worked for him, oh, at least twice, if not more. He’s generous and lovely. I thought, “My goodness, of course I’ll do it.” And Allison Janney and Anna Faris! I’d worked with Ellen before on Broadway, but I hadn’t worked with her for a long time. So it just set itself up to be something I wanted to do, and it came up to every expectation. It was a wonderful week. Is there a TV show you would love to appear on that hasn’t come your way yet?Oh, “Game of Thrones""! Which will never happen. That or “Walking Dead.” Those are my two favorite shows.You could be a zombie, why not?Of course!Have you read the Game of Thrones books? Do you have a character in mind? Well, no. I have them all and I think I’m waiting until they stop the TV show. I read voraciously. I mean, I have so many books. I own every book, I think.What are you reading right now? I’m reading Peter Ackroyd’s Hawksmoor. I’m about halfway through. It’s very good.""Love the Coopers"" is now in theaters.Also on HuffPost:"
