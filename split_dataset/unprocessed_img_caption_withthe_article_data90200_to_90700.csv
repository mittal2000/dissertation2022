Jeans and a T-shirt are often considered more appropriate attire than a buttoned-up suit or a dress with heels.But new research suggests a surprising advantage to dressing up for the workday. Wearing more formal clothing changes the way that people think, helping them to focus on the big picture, according to a study recently published in the journal Social Psychological & Personality Science. The study, which was conducted by researchers at Columbia University and California State University, Northridge, found that clothing had a significant impact on cognitive processing style. More formal clothing resulted in more abstract cognitive processing. ""Wearing formal clothing leads to more big-picture thinking, rather than concrete thinking that focuses on the details,"" study co-author Michael Slepian, a postdoctoral research scholar at Columbia Business School, explained to The Huffington Post. The researchers asked a group of college-age volunteers of both genders to complete tests designed to determine their cognitive processing style at that moment. Before some of the tests, the volunteers ranked the formality of what they had opted to wear. With other tests, the volunteers were specifically directed to put on ""clothing you would wear to class"" or ""clothing you would wear for a job interview."" Across a series of experiments, those wearing the more formal outfits exhibited broader, more holistic thinking.Why did changes in clothing lead to changes in how people thought?""Formal clothing made people feel more powerful, which in turn made them more likely to adopt high-level, abstract thinking,"" Slepian said, pointing out that ""the suit is a symbol of power."" He also noted that ""formal clothing might improve your mood if you feel good in the clothing and think it looks good.""Even if you wear a suit to the office five days a week, the study suggests you're likely to reap these benefits."

Chisholm agreed: ""the truth is always a defense, so let's get the truth out in a legal manner, not through lies, distortions and misrepresentations.""The public comments and challenge are remarkable from the usually-reserved career prosecutors, who until now have remained silent as their reputations have been dragged through the mud by Walker's allies.The heated public exchange comes just as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is scheduled to take up a series of challenges to the probe, and as the U.S. Supreme Court considers granting an appeal of a federal lawsuit that the 7th Circuit rejected last year.And, the comments follow a National Review magazine article published online April 20 that savaged Chisholm and decried the probe as ""the use of law enforcement as a political instrument, as a weapon to attempt to undo election results, shame opponents, and ruin lives."" Although the piece also repeated long-discredited allegations from Wisconsin's right-wing blogs, it was quickly picked up by the national right-wing echo chamber, including Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and the Wall Street Journal editorial board and trumpeted as a breakthrough ""investigation.""Yet the National Review article doesn't even mention the Republican prosecutor leading the probe, Francis Schmitz, nor does it touch on the actual evidence of corruption that gave rise to the bipartisan investigation.As former Milwaukee District Attorney E. Michael McCann told the Center for Media and Democracy: ""If you've got the facts on your side, fight on the facts. If you've got the law on your side, fight on the law. If you've got neither, fight the DA.""Serious Allegations of Corruption Involving WalkerThe current criminal investigation into Walker involves serious allegations that the governor and his campaign disregarded the state's campaign finance laws during the 2012 recall elections.Indeed, when Republican and Democratic District Attorneys petitioned for the investigation, Walker was already the highest-profile politician in modern Wisconsin history and a likely presidential contender. Launching a criminal investigation into the most powerful political figure in the state could not have been an easy choice: these career prosecutors initiated the probe because they believed there was a strong legal and evidentiary basis for doing so, under Wisconsin's long-standing campaign finance laws.Republican prosecutors gathered evidence of Walker secretly raising millions of dollars for the supposedly ""independent"" nonprofit Wisconsin Club for Growth (WiCFG), with the express purpose of bypassing campaign finance disclosure laws. Talking points prepared for the governor advised him to ""stress that donations to WiCFG are not disclosed,"" to call the group ""his 501c4,"" and to tell donors ""that you can accept corporate contributions and it is not reported.""And evidence suggests that Walker had a lot to hide.There is the secret $700,000 donation to WiCFG from an out-of-state mining company, Gogebic Taconite, which at the time was pushing for an open-pit mine in Northern Wisconsin (and got it, after Walker won re-election).And there's the undisclosed $1.5 million donation from billionaire John Menard, whose company Menard's Hardware was awarded $1.8 million in tax credits from the jobs agency Walker chairs, not to mention a drop-off in environmental law enforcement.WiCFG spent at least $9.1 million during the recall elections, and funneled at least $10 million more to other politically-active groups like Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, while reporting that it spent $0 on politics to the IRS.Since the beginning, Walker and his allies have fought the probe not by denying coordination, but by claiming the rules don't apply to so-called ""issue ads"" that stop short of expressly telling viewers how to vote. But if the Walker campaign coordinated activities with third-party groups, state law is clear that the coordinated spending is not ""independent,"" but legally considered an in-kind campaign contribution subject to reporting laws, regardless of whether it involved so-called ""issue ads."" The same is true in federal elections, under federal law.In January of 2014, Judge Gregory Peterson--who had only recently been assigned the case--sided with arguments from Walker and WiCFG and quashed subpoenas issued in the probe, but just two weeks later stayed his own order, writing that the state's theory ""is an arguable interpretation of the statutes"" and asking that an appellate court resolve the dispute.WiCFG and other Walker allies soon filed an array of lawsuits in state and federal court, and the probe has remained stalled ever since.Republican-Led Investigation Supported by ""Credible, Hard Evidence""Although repeatedly portrayed as a ""partisan witch hunt,"" the investigation involves five District Attorneys, from both the Republican and Democratic parties. It was authorized by both Republican and Democratic judges, including Judge James Daley, the GOP-backed candidate for Wisconsin Supreme Court earlier this year.And it is led by Special Prosecutor Francis Schmitz.Schmitz started his legal career as a clerk for federal judge John Coffey, a Reagan appointee who the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described as ""an unyielding conservative."" Schmitz worked for years as a federal prosecutor, receiving two awards from the U.S. Department of Justice, including the prestigious ""U.S. Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service"" from Republican Michael Mukasey. Schmitz was on George W. Bush's shortlist to be named the chief federal prosecutor in the state as U.S. attorney, and he served in the U.S. Army and in the U.S. Army Reserve, retiring with the rank of Colonel.Wisconsin's Republican Attorney General, J.B. Van Hollen, was initially asked to lead the probe, but declined--not because he thought the investigation was legally suspect, but because of a possible conflict-of-interest, with Van Hollen acknowledging that ""a campaign financing investigation... could foreseeably involve individuals with whom I have relationships.""Van Hollen said the probe was better handled by the state's Government Accountability Board, which is a nonpartisan board of retired judges, from both parties, appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate, and charged with interpreting and applying the state's campaign finance law. The Board unanimously approved its participation in the investigation. Its current Chair Gerald Nichol--a former Republican elected official--has stated that the Board does ""not take investigations lightly"" and launched the probe after being presented with ""credible, hard evidence"" the law had been violated.The investigation has been conducted under the state's ""John Doe"" statute, a proceeding similar to a grand jury but overseen by a judge.Former Milwaukee County District Attorney McCann, a Democrat who utilized the John Doe process to prosecute former State Senate Majority Leader Chuck Chvala (D-Madison) during the 2001-2002 Legislative Caucus Scandal, explained that""John Does"" are particularly effective for investigating political corruption cases. The alternative is to impanel a grand jury of 17 citizens for months on end, a costly and burdensome process rarely used in Wisconsin.Doug Haag, a career state prosecutor for 29 years, explained to the Center for Media and Democracy how the John Doe works. ""It's the only vehicle other than a grand jury that allows a prosecutor to subpoena witnesses and compel testimony in the investigative stage,"" he said.While grand juries were common before the 1970s they fell out of use in more recent years and the John Doe process is now used commonly for a variety of crimes. Haag is a ""very strong supporter"" of the John Doe law as currently constituted. ""At this point it would be very cumbersome to impanel a grand jury when in fact you can get the same information with a single judge, compel testimony and protect the identity of witnesses before the John Doe,"" Haag said.The John Doe statute allows for a judge to order that the investigation be conducted in secret, which applies not only to prosecutors, but also to the targets of the investigation. The duration of the gag orders raise First Amendment concerns, yet have long been part of the standard operating procedure for John Doe investigations, including political corruption investigations into both Democrats and Republicans.Prosecutors argue that secrecy is needed to encourage cooperation by people reluctant to testify against powerful individuals, as well as to protect the reputation of the targets while the investigation is in a pre-charge state, since many John Does are closed without charges.In commencing this John Doe probe, Republican prosecutors in Dodge (see PDF) and Columbia (see PDF) counties found ""evidence that criminal violations"" of the state's campaign finance laws had occurred and, like their Democratic counterparts, asked that the probe be conducted under a secrecy order, given that ""the individuals involved in this investigation are well-placed political operatives closely tied with the current Governor of the State of Wisconsin.""Making the investigation public, they wrote in their court filings, ""would generate substantial publicity,"" which could result in the destruction of evidence and damage reputations before criminal charges were filed. Yet soon after the first subpoenas were issued in the probe, Wisconsin Club for Growth director Eric O'Keefe spoke with the Wall Street Journal editorial board, and the investigation has been subject to selective leaks ever since.With the case now before the Wisconsin Supreme Court, prosecutors are asking that more documents be unsealed, so the public can assess for themselves the PR campaign to call the bipartisan criminal probe a ""political witch hunt."" Yet the Court has so far declined to open up the documents, and Walker hasn't joined their call for transparency.Milwaukee District Attorney's Long Record of Prosecuting DemocratsThe current investigation grew out of an earlier John Doe probe into corruption in Walker's office when he was Milwaukee County Executive. Milwaukee County District Attorney Chisholm opened the first John Doe in 2010 after Walker's office stonewalled an investigation into the theft of money from a veteran's fund.That probe, which was closed in 2013, eventually led to convictions of six former Walker aides and associates, on charges ranging from the embezzlement of veteran's funds, to child enticement, to illegal political campaigning on the public dime.A second John Doe was opened in August of 2012, and soon spread to four other counties, thanks to a GOP-backed law requiring that campaign finance violations be prosecuted in the counties where defendants reside. Special Prosecutor Schmitz was appointed to lead the five-county effort and to limit the appearance of partisan bias.Although ""John Doe 2"" is led by a Republican Special Prosecutor, involves Republican and Democratic prosecutors from across the state, and was approved by Republican judges, Walker's allies have nonetheless made Chisholm their target for the ""political witch hunt"" claims, since he is elected to office as a Democrat.Outlets like Fox News and the National Review have repeated allegations from a ""former staff prosecutor"" that Chisholm's investigation into Walker--which started in 2010--was actually motivated by his public school teacher wife's dismay at Walker's anti-union Act 10 legislation, which was introduced in 2011. Yet the source for the claims, the ""former staff prosecutor,"" was actually a former unpaid intern who worked just 5 1/2 months filling out grant applications and previously made drunken death threats to Chisholm and his family.In reality, Chisholm does have a long record of prosecuting political corruption, but he almost exclusively has gone after fellow Democrats.In 2010, for example, Chisholm used the John Doe process to prosecute Democratic Milwaukee County Supervisor Toni Clark on felony charges related to the personal use of $6,300 in campaign funds. Clark was sentenced to six months in jail, with work-release privileges, and three years' probation.Scott Walker, who was Milwaukee County Executive at the time, didn't portray that investigation into a Democrat as a ""political witch hunt,"" nor did he decry the charges as an example of the ""criminalization of politics""--after all, Chisholm had thrown the book at her, pursuing felony charges against a county official who misused a few thousand in campaign funds. Instead, Walker said the case was ""a reminder to all others in office that we must maintain the highest ethical standards.""In 2007, Chisholm worked with federal officials in a complicated John Doe case involving bribery and intimidation charges for Alderman Michael McGee, a Democrat. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, McGee was convicted by a federal jury and sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison, and later pled no contest in state court to the felony of lying to an elections official and the misdemeanor of violating court orders related to the John Doe proceeding.In 2012--at the same time that Chisholm was pursuing the John Doe investigation into Walker--the Milwaukee District Attorney was leading a broader John Doe investigation into corruption allegations in the Democrat-led Milwaukee County government.Chisholm's office oversaw a sting operation aimed at Milwaukee County Supervisor Johnny Thomas, a Democrat described as a ""rising star of the Board's left wing,"" and brought felony charges after Thomas accepted a $500 campaign contribution that was allegedly offered in exchange for promoting a company for a county contract. A Milwaukee jury acquitted Thomas of bribery and misconduct charges.And following Walker's victory in the 2012 recall elections, court filings show that his opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, was fined $20,000 for accepting PAC donations in excess of campaign finance limits.All evidence suggests that Chisholm's office takes the rules governing ethics and political corruption very seriously, whether the violations are committed by a Democrat or a Republican.""Pre-Dawn Raids"" or Typical Search Warrant?The National Review article devotes a lot of space to the execution of search warrants, which it describes as ""armed"" ""pre-dawn raids.""The outlet makes the astounding claim that ""these raids and subpoenas were often not based on traditional notions of probable cause but on mere suspicion, untethered to the law or evidence, and potentially violating the Fourth Amendment,"" but provides no evidence to back up the hyperbole.In contrast, this October 2013 affidavit in support of subpoenas, which is publicly available, lays out the facts establishing the legally-required probable cause that the searches will produce documents relevant to the criminal campaign finance violations that were the subject of the John Doe.""No judge will authorize a search warrant based on 'mere suspicion,'"" Dane County Sheriff David Mahoney, a Democrat, explained to CMD.""The statutes are very clear. To get a search warrant, you have to write out a complaint laying out probable cause that you will find evidence at that location. If you think the computers you are looking for are in the home based on intelligence you have gathered, you have to convince a judge. A lot of thought and detail goes into presenting this to a judge, because the evidence could later be thrown out if there was not a legitimate finding based on facts outlined in a complaint.""Although search warrants are issued by a judge, in response to a petition from a prosecutor, how the warrants are executed is left to law enforcement--so any critique of the John Doe ""raids"" is really a complaint about standard law enforcement practices, former prosecutors and law enforcement officers tell CMD. And nothing described by the National Reviewappeared out of the ordinary for executing search warrants to secure evidence that could be destroyed, they say.Indeed, although targets of the Walker probe have challenged various aspects of the investigation in a barrage of well-funded lawsuits and legal maneuvers, they haven't legally challenged how the search warrants were executed, despite hyperbole in right-wing press.""Law enforcement has two goals in executing a search warrant: the safety of all involved and to prevent the destruction of evidence,"" Mahoney said. ""You don't call ahead and let them know you are coming.""The first step when entering a home is to secure the premises and take control of the situation. ""You get in, assess any dangers, secure the scene, and allow it to be searched,"" one former prosecutor said. ""This is not a party invitation.""""Safety is always a concern,"" McCann told CMD. ""Even a law-abiding person may have firearms, and they might wake up after you enter home, get startled, and grab for a weapon."" Mahoney described an instance he had a gun drawn on him while executing a search warrant for a white-collar crime, and says that sheriff's deputies regularly find weapons during searches.Although the National Review leads with the claim that officers brought a battering ram to the home of one Walker aide, Mahoney says this is standard.""You are required to knock and give people a reasonable time to open the door, but you are also required to execute the warrant with necessary force,"" he said. ""So if they don't open the door, you don't leave a calling card and say 'I'll be back in an hour.' If they are not home or not answering, you sometimes have to knock down the door.""Otherwise, the targets of the search warrants can begin destroying evidence.Likewise, when looking for documents, ""you want the person on the premises,"" McCann says, ""so you do it early in the morning, before they go to work, when they are most likely to be home."" If the warrant is executed in winter, that means it is going to be dark.This is not to say that the tactics used by police in executing search warrants are above criticism. But the way warrants were executed in the Walker investigation appeared to follow standard law enforcement practices, which should be the same whether the warrant is served in a low-income community of color or a white middle-class neighborhood.As the Wisconsin Supreme Court gets ready to take up the John Doe this month, behind closed doors and without oral arguments, the prosecutors' challenge for full disclosure still awaits a response from the Governor.Will Walker urge the court to release all records, to clear the air--and perhaps his name--or will he continue to cry ""witch hunt"" in hopes that Wisconsin's deeply-compromIsed Supreme Court will sweep the John Doe under the rug?Read more about the criminal investigation in the Center for Media and Democracy's special report.

There is nothing specifically Jewish about the bands he worked with, such as the Grateful Dead or the Rolling Stones, or the venues in which he produced concerts, such as at the Fillmore (East and West) and Winterland arenas. There is nothing Jewish about the concert posters for which the Fillmore was famous, and which are included in the exhibition, or the artist's memorabilia, such as Jerry Garcia's ""Wolf"" guitar, or Janis Joplin's tambourine, Duane Allman's Les Paul guitar, Keith Richards' leather boots or a shard of a Jimi Hendrix guitar. So, what's Skirball got to do with Graham?Turns out there is a story behind this show worth telling:Graham was killed in a helicopter crash on Oct. 25, 1991, along with his girlfriend, Melissa Gold, and the pilot, Steve Kahn. Graham was 60.His death was reported immediately on radio and TV. Robert Kirschner, then the rabbi at San Francisco's Temple Emanu-El, one of the oldest congregations in California, recalls hearing the news on the radio and that, a few minutes later, his phone rang. It was novelist Herbert Gold, Melissa's ex-husband, asking whether Kirschner would preside over the funerals of Gold, Graham and Kahn, which he did over three successive days.Kirschner did not know Graham personally, he said in a recent interview, but one couldn't live in San Francisco and not know of Graham, whose career stretched back to the late 1960s, to his benefit concerts for the San Francisco Mime Troupe, known as Acid Tests, to the early performances of Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, through the shows at the original Fillmore and its successors, Fillmore West and Fillmore East, to concert tours for Bob Dylan and The Band and the Stones. In short order and in accordance with Jewish custom, a funeral for Graham was hastily arranged at Temple Emanu-El. Kirschner was amazed by the turnout. An estimated 2,000 mourners filled every seat, while more stood at the door. Among the attendees were many of the musicians Graham had worked with (and on occasion fought with). Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead spoke. Carlos Santana played an instrumental version of ""I Love You Much Too Much,"" a Yiddish song Graham had taught him.In preparing for the funeral, Kirschner got a glimpse into Graham's life that was not always on display -- its essential Jewish elements, such as Graham's childhood escape from Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied France, his Bronx upbringing, his work in the Catskills, his identification with the social idealism of the 1960s in general, but more specifically, with bands such as the Grateful Dead. Kirschner was aware that Graham underwrote the annual two-story menorah in San Francisco's Union Square, and he knew about Graham's very public protest against President Ronald Reagan's trip to the cemetery in Bitburg, Germany, where members of the Nazi SS were buried, followed by the firebombing of Graham's office by neo-Nazis several days later.A few days after the funeral, on Nov. 3, 1991, a concert in Graham's memory called ""Laughter, Love and Music"" took place on the Polo Fields of Golden Gate Park, where an audience of more than 300,000 listened to stand-up comedy by Robin Williams and performances by Aaron Neville, Carlos Santana, the Grateful Dead, Jackson Browne and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.Kirschner was struck by how many lives Graham -- who played no instruments, wrote no songs and gave no performances himself -- had touched. So now, Kirschner, in his current position as Skirball's museum director, is fulfilling his long-held intention to tell Graham's full story. About three years ago, Kirschner reached out to Graham's biographer, Bob Greenfield, who put him in touch with the Bill Graham Memorial Foundation and with Graham's two sons, David Graham and Alex Graham-Sult. Turns out they, too, were interested in showcasing, as Kirschner put it, ""the Jewish dimension of Bill's identity formation and his values."" The Graham sons' vast collection of memorabilia and ephemera forms the substance of the exhibition, which toggles between Graham's own life and the concerts he produced.The exhibition opens with keepsakes from Graham's Dickensian childhood; he was born Wolfgang Grajonca in Berlin in 1931, his father died right after he was born, and when his mother could not support him and his five sisters, she put him in an orphanage, which sent him on a kindertransport to France when the Nazis came to power. He eventually arrived in New York at age 11, then had to wait to be chosen by a Jewish foster family in the Bronx. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School and Anglicized his own name (there is a yearbook with a photo of ""William Graham""); he would later serve in the Korean War and work in the Catskills. In the meantime, Graham helped two of his five sisters, Rita and Ester Grajonca, immigrate to the United States and settle in San Francisco (his mother and his youngest sister, Tolla, died at Auschwitz; Ester also was sent to Auschwitz but survived; Evelyn and Sonia survived via Shanghai and remained in Europe). He traveled to San Francisco to see his sisters and to try his hand at acting. However, when a performance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe in Lafayette Park was busted for being ""obscene,"" Graham discovered his calling: concert promoter.After the initial biographical component, the exhibition shifts to an impressive and detailed display of more than 400 artifacts from all over the country that illustrate Graham's professional career. As organized by Skirball curator Erin Clancey, the show includes concert posters, a re-creation of the famous Joshua White Light Show, which turned concerts at the Fillmore into multimedia experiences; there also are concert photos and rock portraits by Baron Wolman, Ken Regan and Jim Marshall, as well as Graham's personal scrapbooks from the American portion of the Live Aid concert, costumes from the Grateful Dead New Year's Eve shows, and some charred remains from Graham's firebombed office. There also are archival concert footage and audio interviews from Jerry Garcia, Wavy Gravy and Carlos Santana. Even better, the show's audio tour features a reincarnation of Graham himself, an effect created by stitching together his archived interviews.Threading throughout the exhibit is a leitmotif of how Graham's own experience informed his vision for popular culture. The way Graham protected his childhood friend Ralph Moratz in the orphanage is reflected in his fiercely protective stance toward his performers and the high standards he had for the concerts he produced, both for the artists' sake and the audience's experience.

He resigned as speaker after his arrest. Silver lost a bid last week to dismiss the federal corruption charges.Both cases stem from a 2013 anti-corruption panel known as the Moreland Commission that was created and abruptly dismantled by Governor Andrew Cuomo, a move that triggered an investigation by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.Bharara has castigated Albany for housing ""one of the most corrupt governments in the nation"" and said the concentration of power among the ""three men in the room"" - as Cuomo, Silver and Skelos were widely known - may be part of the problem.

The remainder were divided among the two fighters' promotion companies and MGM, who will make seats available to their best customers.A Showtime official told Reuters the cable giant, which will share pay-per-view rights with rival HBO, had been fielding calls from anxious A-listers over the last 24 hours eager to confirm ringside reservations.But with demand far out-stripping supply, some celebrities faced the humbling prospect of being shut out or bumped into the upper levels.Seat or no seat, celebrity parties raged up and down the Las Vegas Strip on Friday night with something for nearly every taste and wallet.For high-rollers, hip hot artist Jay Z offered a mega-expensive $50,000 a table VIP bash around the megafight while P. Diddy threw a poolside bash with a $10,000 a table cover complete with Sports Illustrated swimsuit models.The souvenir black market was also doing brisk business with vendors reaching into plastic garbage bags and pulling out knockoff fight T-shirts at less than half the $35 price tag at officially lisenced kiosks inside the casinos.Showtime confirmed to Reuters the fight will have an Oscars-worthy front row with Hollywood royalty like Clint Eastwood and Robert De Niro, squeezed in alongside celebrities from the sport world such as New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and the team's billionaire owner Robert Kraft.Only a lucky few will get the chance to view the fight live while everyone else will have to watch on pay-per-view.""You know what, I go to all of Floyd's fights and the last time I spent $2,700 on the Canelo Alvarez fight in 2013,"" Mayweather fan Scott Avig from Detroit told Reuters in Las Vegas. ""I was willing to spend about $3,000 for this fight, for a decent seat. The problem was with those prices you are way up in the top.""The secondary market is ridiculous this time.""Even with tickets out of reach for the average person, the Las Vegas tourism and convention bureau estimated between 150,000 to 200,000 fight fans will invade Las Vegas to be part of buzz,Crowd control will be the main security focus with Mayweather's last two fights at the MGM Grand ending in stampedes and injuries.After a Mayweather-Marcos Maidana bout last May, 60 people were injured while the rematch in September also ended in crowd trouble and injuries.

They are defused or detonated in controlled blasts but not before causing disruption, evacuations or sometimes even death.""The older they are, the more dangerous they become,"" said Detlef Jaab, a Berlin police munitions expert who has defused thousands of the devices over 23 years.""It's a dangerous job but there's a lot of variety and freedom to make decisions, whether a bomb can be defused or is too deteriorated and has to be detonated where it's found.""The sounds and smells of World War Two, which Germans will mark next week, come back to life at a police blasting ground in Berlin's Grunewald forest eight times each year when Jaab's squad blows up stockpiled munitions.Air raid warning sirens wail before the earth in the high-security area erupts in successive explosions. The ground shakes, red-hot shrapnel sometimes flies through the forest and smoke wafts over the site.""There are still an estimated 2,500 bombs buried in Berlin and many more artillery shells. Since 1948 we have found 1,395 bombs,"" said Jaab.About 56 tonnes of unexploded ordnance were retrieved last year in Berlin, the prime target of British and American aerial bombs that was further devastated by Soviet artillery and grenades during the climactic Battle of Berlin 70 years ago.The country was pummel by 1.5 million tonnes of bombs from British and American warplanes that killed 600,000 people. German officials estimate 15 percent of the bombs failed to explode, some burrowing six meters deep. ACUTE DANGERMany are found by city planners studying war-era aerial maps, construction workers or people digging in gardens. Farmers sometimes find bombs weighing up to 4,000 pounds pushed, like boulders, to the surface by the process of frost and thaw.""The dangers lurking grow more acute as time passes,"" said Wilfried Mueller, who oversees the removal of munitions on federal and military properties from his Hanover headquarters.Mueller said while some of the bombs can be found by studying aerial photographs and looking for signs: ""Dredging canals, rivers, lakes, seashores or waterways is very difficult. Unexploded bombs are everywhere.""Germany's Luftwaffe began bombing civilian targets early in the war before the Allies responded with aerial attacks that destroyed many German towns and cities.Three police explosives experts in Goettingen were killed in 2010 while preparing to defuse a 1,000-pound bomb and last year a construction worker in Euskirchen was killed when his power shovel struck a buried 4,000-pound bomb. In 1994 three Berlin construction workers were killed in a similar accident.In 2012 a fireball lit up the sky in Munich, causing millions of euros of damage to 17 buildings, when authorities had to detonate a deteriorated 500-pound bomb. In April this year a 1,000-pound bomb ripped a three-meter-deep hole in a motorway near Offenbach.Hardly a week goes by without a bomb being found, often forcing thousands to evacuate their homes or offices. Germans are often unperturbed by the disruption, taking it in their stride as a fact of everyday life.""Germans have developed an obsession about security and safety yet when it comes to World War Two bombs that are found just about everywhere we just accept it,"" said Jessica Gienow-Hecht, an historian and war scholar at Berlin's Free University.""It touches on Germany's responsibility and war guilt,"" she added, saying she grew up playing in bomb craters and was matter of factly told about bomb damage by realtors while looking to buy a house.

Among the prominent U.S. citizens on the passenger list were Mr. and Mrs. Albert Hubbard and Albert Gwynne Vanderbilt. The liner left New York on schedule and steamed across the Atlantic. Meanwhile, the German U-boat, U-20, under the command of Kapitanleutnant Walter Schwieger, had sailed from Germany around the north of the British Isles, heading for the south coast of Ireland off Queenstown. She had already sunk three ships and had only three torpedoes remaining.Approaching Ireland's southern coast, the Lusitania's Captain William Turner reduced speed to 18 knots to make port at Queenstown on the high tide. Schwieger sighted and recognized the liner and, at 2:00 p.m. on May 7, U-20 fired a single torpedo at the Lusitania's starboard side. It exploded in a boiler room and the ship sank in 18 minutes.

Men's heart health is improving, but women in the U.S. are dying from heart disease at an alarming rate. In fact, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for women, killing more women each year than all of the cancers combined.

Some doctors are unversed with the different symptoms women experience, such as the nausea, backache, jaw pain, extreme fatigue or shortness of breath that are women's signs of heart attack, rather than the crushing chest pain that men first experience. Treatment options are based on medical research conducted on men; only 24 percent of participants in all heart-related studies are women.I had the pleasure this week to attend a dinner hosted by the heart of Washington, Esther Coopersmith, to honor Barbra Streisand and celebrate the Women's Heart Alliance, which Streisand co-founded. She spoke passionately about the Alliance's awareness campaign, ""Fight the Lady Killer."" The campaign builds on the research of organizations like the Society for Women's Health Research which has consistently promoted research on the sex differences in disease and disorders. The ""Fight the Lady Killer"" campaign includes raising awareness among women and their doctors, more money for research, and investments in treatment geared toward women. Heart disease is not just a health issue; it's an economic one as well. The impact of heart disease poses a significant threat to women's economic security. According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2010, the total costs of cardiovascular diseases in the United States were estimated to be $444 billion. Treatment of these diseases accounts for about $1 of every $6 spent on health care in this country. With women still too often under-employed or underpaid, serious illness has a disproportionate impact on them, easily undermining their and their families' finances. The national economy pays a double price: it overloads our health care system and takes valuable resources out of the workforce. Next week, OWL will be releasing a report highlighting the economic contributions women entrepreneurs are making to our economy. It also examines the gender gap they face getting access to the $30 billion in venture capital invested each year. In 2013, women received a mere 7 percent of those funds.I was struck by the similarities between the investment gender gap and the gender based barriers in diagnosing and treating heart disease. For one example, a number of male investors pride themselves in ""knowing"" what a successful entrepreneur looks like -- a man. It turns out many doctors are convinced they ""know"" what a heart attack looks like -- a guy clutching his chest. The good news in the venture capital world is that pressure is mounting from inside and outside the industry to change. One of the factors was the front-page stories covering the trial over Ellen Pao's accusation of gender discrimination against the VC firm where she worked. She lost, but many believe the conversations surrounding the case moved the needle. ""Fight the Lady Killer"" is poised to have a similar impact on women's heart disease. Barbra Streisand brings together that rare combination of dedication, resources and political intelligence -- she makes it clear that, despite her personal politics, this must be a nonpartisan issue. When Barbra Streisand uses her remarkable voice to talk about the absurdity of a singular approach to treating a disease that expresses vastly different symptoms in women than it does in men, to urge lawmakers to increase the National Institutes of Health budget dedicated to women's heart health, to remind us that heart disease kills 1-in-3 women a year and that we can and must act, people listen -- and act.As we prepare to celebrate ""Mothering Sunday,"" remembering those women who have nurtured us along our path, one way to honor them is to make sure they avoid -- or survive -- heart disease. #GetHeartChecked"
15,POLITICS,3 Steps to Bring Justice and Peace to Baltimore,"Steve Mariotti, ContributorFounder of Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) Author...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-steps-to-bring-justice-_b_7186044.html,,2015-05-01,2015-05-01-1430491083-747802-baltimoreprotestsfreddiegray.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-01-1430491083-747802-baltimoreprotestsfreddiegray-thumb.jpg,"For starters, let's stop calling Baltimore's angry young black men ""thugs."" I don't condone the actions of rioters or looters. It's terrible that police officers were hurt and businesses were destroyed or damaged. Having worked as an educator with inner-city youth for over thirty years, however, I can attest that teenagers raised in poverty are chronically anxious, frustrated, afraid and mad--but the majority are not ""thugs.""Out of 23,000 Baltimore City public high school students, roughly 200 may have engaged in rioting or looting (235 people were arrested during the riot; police said on Twitter that many were ""juveniles""). ""Of course it's not the right word, to call our children 'thugs,'"" Baltimore City Councilman Carl Stokes told CNN's Erin Burnett last Tuesday. ""These are children who have been set aside, marginalized, who have not been engaged by us."" In the wealthiest state in our nation, Catholic Charities of Maryland found in 2014 that 36.5 percent of Baltimore City children live under the poverty line. Add a police department that practices ""zero tolerance"" policing and is notorious for administering beatings and ""rough rides,"" and you have a powder keg ready to explode. Freddie Gay's horrible death and the police department's tone-deaf response lit the match. I congratulate Baltimore City's State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby for pressing charges on May 1 against all six officers involved. I propose three steps to help bring justice and peace to Baltimore: 1. End ""zero tolerance"" policing. 2. Expunge juvenile records for youth saddled with nonviolent convictions by zero tolerance policing. 3. Teach every public high school student how to participate in our economy by providing financial literacy and entrepreneurship education classes.End Zero Tolerance Policing  Zero tolerance policing clamps down on minor crimes like graffiti to deter more serious criminal activity. It was instituted in Baltimore by former mayor Martin O'Malley, who served from 1997-2007. Speaking to CNN April 30, former police commissioner Edward Norris (2000-2002), explained that zero tolerance resulted in people being arrested for ""drinking a beer in front of their homes,"" and said, ""zero tolerance is a bad policy, it will never work in any city. When people misunderstand it and twist it and pervert it, you end up with this kind of problem."" At least, Norris added, Freddie Gray's tragic death ""opens a dialogue into how we got into this mess.""The Baltimore Sun uncovered that the city has paid $5.7 million since 2011 to settle lawsuits brought by residents for 102 instances of ""excessive force."" The city spent another $5.8 million on legal fees defending police officers. The New York Times (""Baltimore's 'Broken Relationship"" with Police"") reported April 24 that Mr. Gray is not the first black man in Baltimore to emerge from a police van with a spinal cord injury. Jeffrey Alston, who became paralyzed from the neck down after a van ride, settled for $6 million in 2004. The following year, Dondi Johnson, also paralyzed after a van ride, won a jury award of $7.4 million. Alarmed by the number of wrongful death lawsuits against Baltimore's police department, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake requested a Justice Department review last year. Let's hope she can end ""zero tolerance,"" which she has repeatedly criticized as a crime-fighting strategy. Expunge Criminal Records for Non-Violent Juvenile Offenders The staggering arrest rates caused by zero tolerance have saddled many of Baltimore's young minorities with criminal records. A juvenile criminal record can follow you for the rest of your life, making it difficult to find a job, rent an apartment, obtain a mortgage or join the military. Baltimore should seriously consider expunging juvenile criminal records for non-violent offenders caught in the zero-tolerance net. ExpungeMaryland launched July 2014, after its founders noticed that more people in Baltimore and Maryland search for expungement on Google than from any other city or state. ExpungeMaryland provides an app and online assistance. It also seeks to draw attention to what founder Jason Tanesha says are ""needlessly complicated laws on expungement in Maryland compared to other states."" Bring Entrepreneurship Education to All Public High Schools One thing does engage inner-city youth who feel marginalized--teaching them how to participate in our economy. I first started teaching impromptu business lessons at Boys & Girls High School in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn in 1982 in a desperate attempt to gain control of my incredibly rowdy classes. To my shock, it worked! I started the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) in 1987, because I consistently found that entrepreneurship education gets even the most disengaged students excited about learning. It helps them earn money, and relieves them of a great deal of frustration and hopelessness. Currently, though, our schools do not teach our inner-city youth financial literacy, and their parents may not know how to teach them either. Since opening in 2002, NFTE Baltimore, led by Patricia Eisner, has reached nearly 10,000 students from low-income communities with entrepreneurship education programs, including in some schools, such as The Reginald F. Lewis High School. Baltimore's Reginald Lewis was a brilliant entrepreneur from a middle-class family who became the richest black man in America in the 1980s, with a net worth of $400 million. He was a great supporter of NFTE, as is his widow, Loida Lewis. Mr. Lewis told me--and after spending my life teaching kids whom society has written off I am convinced--that there is no entrepreneurial gene that only a favored few have. Students exposed to entrepreneurship become aware of five assets every individual has: time, talent, attitude, energy, and unique knowledge of their communities. We have extraordinary success stories at NFTE, and I've personally witnessed many urban youth use entrepreneurship education to find pathways out of poverty. But first, we have to stop calling them thugs. Samuel Corum--Anadolu Agency/Getty Images"
16,WOMEN,Mother's Day at Your Local Prison,"Christopher Zoukis, ContributorAuthor, Federal Prison Handbook: The Definitive Guide to Survi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mothers-day-at-your-local-prison_b_7186036.html,"Regardless of how we feel about people who are in prison, children have a right to see, to touch, and to speak with their parents (obviously, provided doing so poses no risks for the child).",2015-05-01,2015-05-01-1430439121-1277532-Fotolia_56857132_XS.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-01-1430439121-1277532-Fotolia_56857132_XS-thumb.jpg,"This Mother's Day, like this past Christmas I won't be able to speak with my mom and tell her I love her. (And this isn't because I'm in prison, but because I've spoken out about prison conditions and have had my phone privileges rescinded). I say not this to say ""poor me,"" but to think about what my mother will go through on May 10th when she doesn't hear my voice. And knowing how this breaks my heart, I can only begin to imagine what that must be like for thousands of incarcerated women who will face this reality not just on Mother's Day, but for most days during their incarceration.It is never so black and white as ""well, you should have thought about that before you did the crime."" Because regardless of whether foresight plays a role in someone's imprisonment, the children are punished in this situation. It's easy enough for people to spout the old ""you do the crime, you do the time"" adage. But people who say that are usually so single-mindedly focused on the incarcerated individual that they forget about the world of people they leave behind. Regardless of how we feel about people who are in prison, children have a right to see, to touch, and to speak with their parents (obviously, provided doing so poses no risks for the child).The problem begins early on for mothers who are pregnant when incarcerated, most of which are forced to hand the child over to authorities (and then either family or state services) immediately after birth. The detrimental short-term and long-term effects this can have on a child's well-being are well-recognized, and have spurred on prisons in some states to adopt nursery programs. But these programs are only a  band-aid solution for mother's whose incarceration extends beyond their infant's first 12 months (there are also concerns about the safety and regulation of these programs when they're being run by prison officials).The fact is that only 9 percent of incarcerated women will ever receive a visit from their under-18 children. Prisons are often too far away to be viable for family members to visit. They may not have dependable transportation, or associated costs may be too high. Over 50 percent of state prisons are between 101-500 miles away from an inmate's last residence, and 43 percent of federal prisons are more than 500 miles away.  In institutions where calls have to be made collect, the cost of long-distance may be too prohibitive for even maintaining phone contact. And given that overwhelmingly the families of individuals incarcerated in this country live in poverty, these things matter if we're actually interested addressing the reproduction of cycles of poverty and recidivism in this country.Contact with family is critical in the rehabilitation process, as the maintenance of strong familial connections through quality visitation and contact reduced recidivism by up to 40 percent. But even more important than the impact on inmates (and it is important), is what being deprived parental contact means to the children left behind. Contact with parents helps ease feelings of abandonment or a child's fear that they somehow caused the parent to leave. And the odds of a child of an incarcerated parent being involved in delinquency themselves increases significantly when they're denied parental visitation.Organizations exist to help facilitate children's visits to incarcerated parents, but they are few and far between. This Mother's Day, Get on the Bus will (as it does on Father's Day) reunite hundreds of children with their incarcerated mothers in California -- so for some women they will have the bittersweetness of the day eased. But for thousands more, the day will remain one of profound sadness. And so while people run to the stores on Saturday, getting stressed and upset over the crowds I hope they will be grateful that for every word or every touch they share with their mothers the next day. Because so many children will not be afforded that luxury -- and as a society, we might be well-served spending some of that energy spent stressing out at the shopping mall trying to do something to change that. If you know someone who could benefit from a children's visitation program, please point them to the following links:GirlsScouts.org GetOnTheBus.us BlackFamilies.orgP.S. Mom, I love you."

Katerina is a Shriner's kid, due to her leg length discrepancy. If you are ever feeling a little down, need some perspective in your life, head on over to a Shriners Hospital; you will undoubtedly be changed, at least for the moment.The same Friday evening as the game, was picture night at the girls' dance studio. I'd taken Katerina in earlier to have her picture taken, but Elizabeth stayed on for the night at the studio, glad to skip the game.The drive to Minneapolis was a full hour, but at least the traffic wasn't bad. We were all so excited! I was even more excited to eat, after having read an article about the Twins' stadium food that my friend Tamara had mentioned on Facebook. Additionally, Andrew Zimmerman, one of my favorite Travel Channel stars, supposedly had a food truck there.After paying twelve bucks to park, which meant a greater trek to the field, we came across a homeless man. We kept walking until Nikos said, ""Wait! Keep going and I'll catch up!"" I know my hubby well, and he's the kind to buy a meal and give it to those who look like they could use one. He ran back with one less ticket to the game and we all hoped the man would make it to and enjoy the game. Nikos promised the man that he'd buy him a hot dog if he showed up.We decided to eat before finding our seats. Nikos bought some kind of steak sandwich, Nikolas a burger, Katerina had loaded nachos, and I had garlic fries and then asked the guy at the counter for a loaded hot dog. The cashier looked annoyed and smirked, then asked what I meant by a ""loaded hot dog."" I explained, ""Well you know, slaw, sauce, onions, the works!"" His robotic reply was handing me a tiny cup of onions and pointing over to the condiment station. I dumped every last diced onion on the hot dog, then saturated it with enough mustard and ketchup that the hot dog was elevated. Nikos also bought a $14 Pepsi and later a popcorn. We were then a hundred dollars poor. I was bummed to not have the time to find Zimmerman's food truck, but the game had already begun.The Target field was massive, hyper-stimulating and impressive. As modern as it all was, the atmosphere still somehow clung to the days of yesteryear, undying energy. The prevalence of nostalgia brought me back to the 1970s, watching a Cincinnati Reds game, hearing the fans, combined with tube socks and the funny talking guy from the speakers. It was an exciting game, the temperature was ideal, and Katerina was hooping and hollering louder than ten rows of fans together. Nikos asked her what just happened in the game and she shrugged her shoulders and replied, ""I have no idea!""The moment I'd taken one big chomp of my hot dog, Nikos shockingly remarked, ""Rebecca! You look like you just puked all over your shirt and pants!"" I scowled at him and then was horrified by the mess all over me. Every bit of my hot dog was all over me! I told Nikos to go get me some napkins and he further aggravated me by saying only a washing machine would take care of that kind of mess. After two more bites (What?! No sense in wasting a perfectly yummy hot dog!) I hissed at Nikos to get me some napkins, and he said he first wanted to watch the play. I gave him ""the look,"" and he immediately proceeded to bring me five freaking pitiful napkins.Nikos was right, the sauce just smeared all over my pants and shirt and I was too embarrassed to get up until... the kid in front of me had a small plastic bag over his head, entirely enclosing his mouth and nose, and his parents were distracted by the game. I freaked out and yelled to get that bag off his head. The mom glanced back and then immediately tore off the bag and almost the kid's head in a panic. She thanked me too many times, and I tried to make her feel better by explaining that all three of my kids had done the same at some point in time. Nikos looked shocked and asked when that happened. Eye rolls are very appropriate in a marriage when one asks questions as such.Nikolas told me he couldn't wait for baseball season to begin. He loved the game and admitted that he'd never be able to throw as far as the guys on the team. It had been an exciting evening, and for a couple innings, the Twins were catching up.

Of course, all I had to do was glance down at my mustard/onion/ketchup massacre to remember I was as well put together as scrambled eggs in a frying pan. It was well past Katerina's bed time, so we decided to leave before the game had ended.Driving home sleepy and contented, I sang ""Twinkle Little Star"" to Katerina, our nightly ritual. I turned and appreciatively stated, ""Katerina, thank you for this wonderful game! We wouldn't have gone, had it not been for you and Shriners!"" Katerina wisely replied, ""No Mama, don't thank me. Thank God for making my legs special.""

There certainly shouldn't be. I came across a story online that criticized Disney for its lack of ""complex and strong female characters in its movies,"" specifically targeting the new adaptation of Cinderella. This concerns me. I thought of the women in the Disney movies that I had grown up watching. I thought of Pocahontas, a Native American princess defending her home and culture from a man that she loves. I thought of Mulan, a Chinese woman who enters into a war in order to save her father's life. I thought of Merida from Brave, an archer who defies Scottish royalty in the name of her independence.And they say Disney is lacking in complex and strong female characters?The new Cinderella is a new kind of heroine. She suffers through the deaths of both of her parents and then has to live with the abuses of her stepmother and step-sisters. Cinderella grasps tightly onto the advice given to her by her mother: Have courage and be kind. And that's exactly what she does. Cinderella's resilience gives her the power to endure cruelty and grief. When she has the chance to finally have her ""happily ever after,"" she embraces her opportunity for happiness and does not wallow in her conditions. Despite all of this, she is unfailingly kind. When given the chance to be cruel in return, she looks her stepmother straight in the eye and says, ""I forgive you.""You know, she seems pretty self-sufficient to me.Cinderella acknowledges the importance of a woman's pursuit of happiness. In a world where she is shown no consideration, Cinderella follows her heart to fall in love with a Prince that cares for her. This sort of storyline takes on criticism due to its celebration of the happily ever after. But, to say that this somehow diminishes the resonance of the rest of the story is not fair. Loving another person does not take away from your strength as a woman. The fact that Cinderella ends up happily in love with her Prince does nothing to detract from her autonomy. In fact, the story's ending sends a beautiful message. If you are kind, courageous, strong and hardworking, then love and goodness will surround you. What better message could there be?Disney is not the problem. The problem is that society holds a skewed perception of strong women. We are taught, as women, that we must choose between being a badass and a ball gown enthusiast. Not only is this is wrong, but it is dangerous. To insist that characters like Cinderella are not representations of strong women (simply because they wear glass slippers) is to dismiss femininity as a quality of strength. This is harmful to ""girly girls"" everywhere who want to be taken seriously. Further, it is insulting to our entire sex. If we reinforce the idea that frills and self-sufficiency cannot coexist, we perpetuate the myth that femininity is somehow silly and weak.The truth is that you can be any kind of woman that you want to be and still be a strong woman. You do not have to sort through stereotypes and decide which one to put on each day. You can love Shrek, foster kittens, read Nicholas Sparks books and be a strong woman. You can chug a beer, take swing-dancing lessons, call your mom every Tuesday and be a strong woman. You can be whatever you want to be because you are as strong as you decide you are.

Visually these medals are disappointing and confusing.,2015-05-01,2015-04-30-1430436951-1300885-sculpturevictorious.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-30-1430436951-1300885-sculpturevictorious-thumb.jpg,"'Sculpture Victorious: Art in the Age of Invention 1837-1901' at Tate Britain aims at presenting Imperial Britain as elegant in spite of the obvious lack of restraint and excessive theatricality of their sculptures. Instead of deconstructing this paradox, the Tate show presents it as a scholarly fact. In fact, it is as if this exhibition were curated by the Victorians themselves.Take, for example, one of the show's central pieces; Sir William Reynold-Stephens' 'A Royal Game' (1906-11) which presents a bothered Philip II of Spain trying to vanquish an elegantly hieratic Elizabeth I over a game of chess. Do the English think they embody elegance? Is this kind of art a visual representation of such a belief? The representation of elegance in England has not always been that easy. It should be remembered that Henry VIII's conversion to protestantism and its consequent iconoclasm prevented indigenous painters and sculptors from enjoying the same level of patronage that they had in the continent. Although, Hollywood revisionism has tried to convince us of the fact that Elizabeth I snubbed Philip II, it would be fair to remind the Brits that, first and foremost, it was Philip II who had snubbed his first wife Mary Tudor by simply ignoring her. It was that same King who not only did gather the biggest art collection in the world (now at the Prado) but also singlehandedly commissioned and funded no other than the Escorial Monastery. While the Spanish monarchs were used to purchase Titians, Rubens and Velazquez, Elizabeth I had to conform with a lesser kind of royal portraiture. When we compare Spanish Habsburg to Tudor court portraiture, we see that while the Spaniards could display elegance through modesty (take Velazquez as an example), the British could not restrain from showing off their bling bling in whichever opportunity they found. I think in these islands they call this 'a chip on the shoulder'.This taste for excessive ornament and historicist folly reached its peak in Victorian times when the English finally got the means to properly do what they like to do:; showing off. The outcome is for everybody to see in the Victorian sculptures included in this show. But do not take my word for it, let's read what The Daily Telegraphs' Richard Dorment has to say about this show: 'Sculpture Victorious is like nothing I've encountered in a gallery before. Its incoherence is frightening. The subtitle, ""Art in the Age of Invention 1837-1901"" makes it clear that this is not a conventional survey of Victorian sculpture. The organisers look at the medium in relation to such topics as the expansion of the British Empire, the gathering pace of the industrial revolution, technical and scientific innovation, and new sources of patronage by the state and church. Any single one of those subjects would have provided more than enough material for an entire exhibition.The show starts with a display of coins and medals that refers to the way Victorians wanted to appropriate Imperial Roman imagery. Visually these medals are disappointing and confusing. Not far from there there is the amazing Devonshire Parure, which should have been placed in the middle of the room but instead, it was put in a corner as if they were part of the development of an idea of elegance that included the Industrial Revolution, which is, obviously not the case. Not far from there we have the amazing lead and tin-glazed earthenware Elephant, modelled by Thomas Longmore and John Hénk for Minton and Co, which is displayed in a gallery otherwise dominated by Hiram Powers's neoclassical marble, the Greek Slave. What links the two works in the minds of the curators is that both were shown in International exhibitions - the Greek Slave at the Great Exhibition of 1855, the Elephant at the Paris Exposition of 1889 but that connection gets lost in a sea of confusion. To be honest, I left this show trying to know more about the Elephant. How did it function? How was it supposed to be displayed?

Visually these medals are disappointing and confusing.,2015-05-01,2015-04-30-1430437008-154084-sculpturevictoriousexhi009.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-30-1430437008-154084-sculpturevictoriousexhi009-thumb.jpg,"'Sculpture Victorious: Art in the Age of Invention 1837-1901' at Tate Britain aims at presenting Imperial Britain as elegant in spite of the obvious lack of restraint and excessive theatricality of their sculptures. Instead of deconstructing this paradox, the Tate show presents it as a scholarly fact. In fact, it is as if this exhibition were curated by the Victorians themselves.Take, for example, one of the show's central pieces; Sir William Reynold-Stephens' 'A Royal Game' (1906-11) which presents a bothered Philip II of Spain trying to vanquish an elegantly hieratic Elizabeth I over a game of chess. Do the English think they embody elegance? Is this kind of art a visual representation of such a belief? The representation of elegance in England has not always been that easy. It should be remembered that Henry VIII's conversion to protestantism and its consequent iconoclasm prevented indigenous painters and sculptors from enjoying the same level of patronage that they had in the continent. Although, Hollywood revisionism has tried to convince us of the fact that Elizabeth I snubbed Philip II, it would be fair to remind the Brits that, first and foremost, it was Philip II who had snubbed his first wife Mary Tudor by simply ignoring her. It was that same King who not only did gather the biggest art collection in the world (now at the Prado) but also singlehandedly commissioned and funded no other than the Escorial Monastery. While the Spanish monarchs were used to purchase Titians, Rubens and Velazquez, Elizabeth I had to conform with a lesser kind of royal portraiture. When we compare Spanish Habsburg to Tudor court portraiture, we see that while the Spaniards could display elegance through modesty (take Velazquez as an example), the British could not restrain from showing off their bling bling in whichever opportunity they found. I think in these islands they call this 'a chip on the shoulder'.This taste for excessive ornament and historicist folly reached its peak in Victorian times when the English finally got the means to properly do what they like to do:; showing off. The outcome is for everybody to see in the Victorian sculptures included in this show. But do not take my word for it, let's read what The Daily Telegraphs' Richard Dorment has to say about this show: 'Sculpture Victorious is like nothing I've encountered in a gallery before. Its incoherence is frightening. The subtitle, ""Art in the Age of Invention 1837-1901"" makes it clear that this is not a conventional survey of Victorian sculpture. The organisers look at the medium in relation to such topics as the expansion of the British Empire, the gathering pace of the industrial revolution, technical and scientific innovation, and new sources of patronage by the state and church. Any single one of those subjects would have provided more than enough material for an entire exhibition.The show starts with a display of coins and medals that refers to the way Victorians wanted to appropriate Imperial Roman imagery. Visually these medals are disappointing and confusing. Not far from there there is the amazing Devonshire Parure, which should have been placed in the middle of the room but instead, it was put in a corner as if they were part of the development of an idea of elegance that included the Industrial Revolution, which is, obviously not the case. Not far from there we have the amazing lead and tin-glazed earthenware Elephant, modelled by Thomas Longmore and John Hénk for Minton and Co, which is displayed in a gallery otherwise dominated by Hiram Powers's neoclassical marble, the Greek Slave. What links the two works in the minds of the curators is that both were shown in International exhibitions - the Greek Slave at the Great Exhibition of 1855, the Elephant at the Paris Exposition of 1889 but that connection gets lost in a sea of confusion. To be honest, I left this show trying to know more about the Elephant. How did it function? How was it supposed to be displayed? It is as if the curators believed that technical prowess per se was a source of artistic value which, of course, is never the case. The question that this show brings about through sheer confusion is that of the notion of art in Victorian times. The fact that I left the Tate Britain without a convincing answer is, to say the least, worrying. Is this exhibition an example of how self deluded are the English since Victorian times? Maybe."
