On Friday, she had introduced a bill that would have permitted oil production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.""It's clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory. The promises made to us at statehood, and since then, mean absolutely nothing to them.

But the main purpose of his five-day visit was pretty much derailed when nearly 500 impoverished people were removed from the streets of Manila and taken to a far-off, upscale resort the day before the Pope arrived, according to Time.According to British tabloid the Daily Mail Online, children as young as 5 were rounded up and also thrown into squalid concrete detention centers alongside adult criminals. Local authorities refuted the Mail’s claims, but Philippines Welfare Secretary Corazon Juliano-Soliman admitted that 100 homeless families were taken to the upscale Chateau Royal Batangas resort. The accusations are particularly concerning considering the scope of Manila’s homeless crisis. According to a report released last year, 22.8 million people in metro Manila don’t have roofs over their heads, making it the highest homeless population in the world, The Star reported. The issue was exacerbated even further after Typhoon Haiyan hit in 2013.Juliano-Soliman said the goal of relocating the homeless people was to protect the vulnerable families from the crowds, but she also admitted that she feared they would be something of an eyesore, Time reported. ""[They] could be seen as not having a positive influence in the crowd [and be] used by people who do not have good intentions,"" Juliano-Soliman told Time. The process was organized by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), a group that offers social services to underserved families.But advocates are hardly satisfied with Juliano-Soliman’s justification.Kabataan party-list Rep.

(AP Photo/L'Osservatore Romano, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f9711f00000002252d30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Pope Francis on Friday (Jan. 23) warned the Vatican’s top marriage judges that they should not “lock the salvation of persons within the straits of legalism” and indicated he wants the church to no longer charge for the sometimes onerous and expensive annulment process.“This is a point I want to emphasize: the sacraments are free,” Francis told jurists of the Roman Rota, the church’s final court of appeals for annulments.“The sacraments give us grace,” he said. “And a marriage proceeding” — like an annulment — “touches on the sacrament of marriage.”“How I wish all marriage proceedings were free of charge!” he added.Annulments have been a source of controversy since at least the time of King Henry VIII, who split with the Roman Catholic Church over the pope’s refusal to grant him an annulment.In modern times, the process of nullifying a church marriage has been derided by some as too easy, criticized by others as too complicated, or viewed as too expensive and accessible only those with influence or means.In the past year, Francis has added new fuel to the debate by raising the related question of Communion for divorced and remarried Catholics who do not have an annulment and are barred from receiving the Eucharist.That’s a serious pastoral problem in U.S. parishes, for example, and the pope’s push for a solution has sparked an intense pushback by some conservative churchmen and their allies.Francis convened a major meeting of top bishops last fall to discuss the topic, among other things, and a follow-up convocation is set for next October following the pope’s trip to the U.S.In the meantime, Francis has also sought to reform and streamline the annulment process and he has pushed to make it less expensive, and more widely available. While all U.S. dioceses have a church court, or tribunal, to deal with marriage cases, the majority of Catholics living in poorer parts of the world often have no such recourse even if they could afford it.Some U.S. dioceses, which account for nearly half of all annulment cases in the Catholic Church, have announced that they will no longer charge fees, usually about $400, for the process. The dioceses in Cleveland and South Bend, Ind., took that step last year.Beyond administrative fixes, however, Francis has also pushed pastors and canon lawyers to be merciful with Catholics and to do everything they can so that the rules do not get in the way of grace and the sacraments.That was the thrust of the pontiff’s address to the church jurists on Friday at the start of the Rota’s 2015 term, and it was also the theme of his homily at morning Mass Friday in the chapel at his Vatican residence.“Confessions often seem like a procedure, a formality,” Francis said. “Everything is mechanical! No! Where’s the meeting in this? The meeting with the Lord who pardons you, hugs you and rejoices.”Confession, he said in one of his characteristically folksy analogies, “is not like going to the dry cleaners to get a stain removed. No! It’s about going to meet with our Father who reconciles, who forgives us and who rejoices.”"

First, what it doesn't say: Buddhism has very little bad to say about same-sex behavior (or, more recently, LGBT identity). Many LGBT people have found spiritual homes in American Buddhist communities, after being excluded from the religions they were born into. Second, what Buddhism does say: that compassion is a paramount value, that we must work to minimize suffering, that there are connections between us greater than our differences.

The health department said others with measles are known to have visited Disney parks in January while infectious but did not elaborate.Among those infected are at least five Disney employees and a student from a local high school that has ordered its unvaccinated students to stay home until Jan. 29.The outbreak has renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked theories suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated.The Los Angeles Times blasted the anti-vaccination movement in an editorial last week for what it called an ""ignorant and self-absorbed rejection of science.""Asked if the anti-vaccination movement contributed to the latest outbreak in California, a spokesman for the state health department Carlos Villatoro, said in an email: ""We think that unvaccinated individuals have been the principal factor.""Barbara Loe Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center, a group calling for ""informed consent"" for parents regarding vaccinations, said the Disneyland outbreak had touched off a ""media frenzy.""""There's a lot of name-calling going on rather than talking about substantive policy issues,"" she said.Homegrown measles, whose symptoms include rash and fever, was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. But health officials say cases imported by travelers from overseas continue to infect unvaccinated U.S. residents. The sometimes deadly virus, which is airborne, can spread swiftly among unvaccinated children.There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia.

But he said 162 bison had been captured and placed into a holding facility as of a week ago.The Buffalo Field Campaign, which opposes the culling and has been monitoring it, said the bison had been dispatched to slaughter since Wednesday, and anticipated that 55 more could be sent on Monday.The culling plan allows the bulk of bison marked for death to be transferred to Native American tribes for slaughter and a certain number of the wandering buffalo to be killed by hunters.The strategy is designed to address worries by ranchers that bison infected with the bacterial disease brucellosis, which can cause miscarriages in cattle, could transmit it to their herds, potentially threatening Montana's brucellosis-free status.The plan this winter to reduce the bison population to 4,000 from 4,900 comes as conservation groups are seeking federal protections for a herd that is a top attraction for the 3 million annual visitors to a park that spans parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.Buffalo Field Campaign spokeswoman Stephany Seay called the culling practice ""the brutal abuse and slaughter of the only wild population of buffalo remaining in this country.""The iconic hump-backed animals once roamed by the tens of millions west of the Mississippi until hunting campaigns reduced their numbers to the fewer than 50 that found safe harbor at Yellowstone in the early 20th century.The Buffalo Field Campaign said that roughly another 100 bison have been killed by hunters outside the park in Montana, while Nash, citing state officials, put that number lower, at 70.Nash said the park usually engages in culling in winter, when bison migrate to lower elevations in search of food. Federal and state officials on horseback have been capturing animals along the park boundary, both inside and outside the park.Conservationists petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last year to provide federal safeguards for the Yellowstone herd, contending it was the only free-roaming band in the country to retain its genetic integrity.

The results of this pan-Hellenic poll will challenge many stereotypical perceptions about the psychology of the pre-election period. -- Citizens believe that Syriza can negotiate on a better level, economically and politically, by 10 percentage points, compared with a New Democracy government. -- A majority of citizens want the new government to negotiate with Europe and not to enter into conflict. Those who would prefer conflict are not the youngest participants. People who identify with the left are split on the ""negotiation or conflict"" dilemma with Europe.-- Even though more people believe that a Syriza government can better negotiate matters of fiscal politics, they do not believe in a socialist government, but rather a liberal one.-- The poll clearly shows that in this election, Greeks are voting for a renewal of political life and a change in the national situation. -- Slightly more than half of voters feel more confident about a coalition government.-- Two in five Greeks identify with the political center. -- One in five Greeks have yet to decide how they will vote. -- More than half of voters believe that the economic situation will remain unchanged after the election. -- People believe that corruption has increased during the debt crisis.

I knew they had made a commitment to Big Oil to force through a vote on the Keystone tar sands pipeline, which would carry the dirtiest oil on earth across our country.  I wasn't even surprised that GOP leaders ended this week's session early so their members could fly to Palm Springs to cozy up to the billionaire oil magnates, the Koch Brothers, at their winter retreat.  What shocked me about the debate last night that stretched past midnight was the way Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the new Republican majority treated their colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  First, McConnell and the new Senate GOP leadership pushed to have debate and votes on all kinds of Republican amendments that had absolutely nothing to do with Keystone. They included measures to prohibit EPA enforcement officials from carrying weapons, to block the designation of new national monuments, and even to halt the historic U.S. agreement with China on cutting dangerous carbon pollution.  Fortunately, we have had enough Democrats in the Senate who stood strong and opposed these ludicrous amendments that have zero to do with the tar sands pipeline.  But things hit a new low last night when Senator McConnell refused -- again and again- - to allow Democrats even one minute to explain their amendments, which the Senate had agreed to consider. He shut down the debate before it even started. You can watch what transpired here: http://youtu.be/yl4neFHnk84  McConnell would not allow debate on an amendment by Senator Ed Markey to close a loophole that could allow the backers of the Keystone pipeline to avoid paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which is used to pay for clean-up in case of an oil spill. He would not allow debate on an amendment by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse to require more campaign finance disclosure from the people who would benefit most from the development of tar sands oil. He would not allow discussion of Senator Patrick Leahy's measure to protect the vital role of local federal district courts in reviewing any legal challenges to the Keystone pipeline.  These were all good amendments that at least deserved a chance to be debated.  It was especially jarring to see the debate silenced by the same Senator McConnell who has been touting his commitment to regular order and a respectful, open process. The same Senator McConnell who said on the floor last January, ""Any Member of the Senate ought to be able to have a fair chance to get his or her amendment adopted."" The same Senator McConnell who told the New York Times this month, ""I don't have any intention of shutting the bill down prematurely or to try to jam either Democrats or Republicans.""   Not only did Senator McConnell go back on his word, he deprived the American people of a critical debate on these important amendments. He also poisoned the well just weeks into the new Congress.  I still don't understand why, just as America is coming out of a deep recession, the Republicans' first move was to turn to a bill that according to the State Department would only create 35 permanent jobs. And I still don't understand why the Republicans would not instead take up the highway bill, which would support millions of jobs.  But at least if the Republicans wanted to start this Congress with a bill to benefit foreign special interests, they could have made good on their promises to respect their colleagues and run the Senate in a fair and open way."

But the priest wasn't one to let anything — not even his aging body— stop him from doing what he felt was spiritually right.On this day, he wore his snow-white hair tied back into a ponytail, and a colorful stole around his shoulders.

In Sanaa, two intelligence agents were shot dead by gunmen on a motorbike, two security sources told Reuters.Witnesses said a crowd estimated at up to 10,000 people marched from Sanaa University towards Hadi's home some 3 km (1.8 miles) away and back, repeating chants denouncing both the Shi'ite Muslim Houthi group and predominantly Sunni al Qaeda.

No to Houthis and no to Affash,"" the crowd shouted, using a nickname for former President Ali Abdullah Saleh who was toppled in a 2011 uprising against his 33-year-rule.Saleh had been cited by the U.N. Security Council for aiding the Houthis to capture Sanaa, capital of the predominantly Sunni country, in September.Hadi, who stepped down on Thursday, blamed the Houthis' control of Sanaa for scuttling his attempt to steer Yemen toward stability after years of turmoil, tribal unrest, deepening poverty and U.S. drone strikes on Sunni Islamist militants.The Houthis virtually held Hadi prisoner at his home residence this week. They accuse him of reneging on a power-sharing agreement they signed with the country's main political parties in his presence after they seized Sanaa.

Under the constitution, parliamentary speaker Yahya al-Ra'i, who comes from Saleh's General People's Congress party, takes office for an interim period while new elections are organized.

This will be the best possible monument to all our dead,"" Russia's RIA news agency quoted rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko as saying at a memorial ceremony in the separatist-held city of Donetsk.He said the separatists also planned to encircle Debaltseve, a town north-east of Donetsk, in the next few days, Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.Eastern Ukraine has seen an escalation of fighting in recent days that Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed on Kiev. The rebels have ruled out more peace talks.Poroshenko responded angrily to the fighting in Mariupol, a city the rebels tried to capture last autumn before a fragile ceasefire was agreed in eastern Ukraine.

Last week Poroshenko said Russia had 9,000 troops stationed in his country and demanded their immediate withdrawal.The nine-month conflict, in which more than 5,000 people have been killed, has triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Russia and the West since the Cold War.Saturday's attack on Mariupol started in the early morning, said pensioner Leonid Vasilenko, 76, who lives in an eastern suburb of the city.""The walls were shaking, the window frames were shaking, paint started to crumble off the house,"" he said by telephone.""I hid in the basement.

The last deadly drone strike was an attack that killed nine suspected al Qaeda militants on Dec. 6, it said.A new government could withdraw tacit approval for U.S. drone strikes, leaving Washington with a tough decision to make about whether to launch unilateral strikes against AQAP.Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said the disputed government in Yemen did not necessarily prevent the United States from engaging in counter-terrorism operations.""We recognize we need to get a much better understanding of where things are going politically in Yemen before we can make any new decisions or move forward in any significant way on counter-terrorism in Yemen,"" Kirby told a Pentagon briefing.Kirby later said it would be ""wrong to conclude"" the United States had stopped focusing on the terrorist threat in Yemen ""or that we won't take action if and when necessary.""Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, later issued a statement, saying, ""The political instability in Yemen has not forced us to suspend counterterrorism operations,"" and adding, ""We also continue to partner with Yemeni security forces.""Another official said it would be incorrect to characterize the counter-terrorism partnership as fully ""ceased."" ""What the future holds? I don't know. It's touch and go right now,"" the official said.""DEATH TO AMERICA""The collapse of Hadi's government threatens to upturn Obama's policy toward a country he hailed just four months ago as a model for ""successful"" partnerships in the fight against Islamic militancy.The administration confirmed on Thursday that it had pulled more U.S. staff from its embassy in the capital Sanaa due to the deteriorating security situation after the Houthi rebels battled their way into Hadi's presidential palace.A former senior U.S. official said that Yemeni authorities for now ""will be much more focused on what goes on in the capital Sanaa than what goes on with al Qaeda in the countryside.""The Shi'ite Muslim Houthi rebels are enemies of AQAP, a Sunni Islamist militant group. But they also oppose the United States, a fact on display during rallies on Friday in Sanaa, where thousands gathered with placards calling for ""Death to America, Death to Israel.""""Hadi was a unique figure who not only tolerated drone strikes, he welcomed them,"" said Bruce Riedel, director of the Brookings Institution think tank's Intelligence Project.""I don't think we're going to have that kind of enthusiastic partner in the foreseeable future,"" Riedel added, saying the United States may be left dealing with fractured, competing institutions in Yemen, with varying attitudes toward Washington.
