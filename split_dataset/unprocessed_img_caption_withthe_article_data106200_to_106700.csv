Women have had to prove over and over again that they are physically capable of participating in athletics. In this blog, we will learn about women whose accomplishments in running have paved the way for women around the world to enjoy and benefit from athletic endeavors. Match the woman with her achievement: (answers at the end): ____ 1. Capitalizing on her Boston Marathon number -- 261 -- she has established a clothing line, 261 Fearless. ____ 2. Overcoming polio as a child, the twentieth of 22 children won bronze at the 1956 Olympics and gold at the 1960 Olympics.____ 3. Named the greatest female athlete of the 20th century, she competed in the long jump and the heptathlon, which includes seven track and field events. ____ 4. She won the gold medal for the women's marathon at the 1984 Olympics; the year in which the marathon for women was introduced.A. Wilma Rudolph B. Kathrine Switzer C. Joan Benoit Samuelson D. Jackie Joyner-KerseeThe twentieth of 22 children, Wilma Rudolph was a sickly child who contracted polio. Through the devoted attention of her mother and family, Rudolph was able to walk with a metal leg brace and by age 12, she no longer needed crutches, the brace or corrective shoes. Educated at home until it was time for her to enter high school, Rudolph joined the basketball team and discovered that she was an athlete. She eagerly accepted the offer of attending the Tennessee State University summer sports camp and at age 16, she won her first Olympic bronze medal as a member of the 4 x 100 relay team at the 1956 Olympics. She won three Olympic gold medals, the first American woman to do so, at the 1960 Olympics. These were the first Olympics to be televised and her accomplishments and her ability to overcome adversity made her a significant role model. Rudolph has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. In 1967 when K.V. Switzer signed up to run the Boston Marathon, women had never competed in that marathon before and it was believed that women were not capable of doing so. But, Kathrine Switzer proved them wrong. Wearing number 261, she survived the efforts of a league official to physically remove her from the race and completed the marathon; the first woman to do so. Since 1967, Switzer has worked to effect change for women including providing opportunities for women to run in countries around the world. Through her efforts, the women's marathon became an Olympic event. Inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame, Switzer ran a marathon at age 64, and today is a speaker and writer. Her line of clothing is labeled 261 Fearless and she says the bib number ""261"" has come to symbolize being fearless in the face of challenges. Joan Benoit Samuelson benefited significantly from the efforts of Kathrine Switzer. The women's marathon was introduced as an event at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and she won the gold medal. Samuelson began running in high school (after breaking her leg skiing) and was named an All-American in cross-country and track during her college career. In 1979, and again in 1983, she won the Boston Marathon. Today, she is a speaker and author and advocates for fitness. Declared by Sports Illustrated as the ""Greatest Female Athlete of the Twentieth Century"" Jackie Joyner-Kersee followed in the footsteps of role model Wilma Rudolph. Joyner-Kersee won six Olympic medals in four separate Olympic games, including three gold medals. Much like Rudolph, she overcame asthma as she pursued her athletic accomplishments in the long jump and heptathlon. Joyner-Kersee still holds the heptathlon record today -- a record she set at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea. As a philanthropist and advocate for social and racial equality, she established the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Foundation, which provides youths and families ways in which to improve the quality of their lives. Learn about more she-roes and celebrate amazing women. These exceptional athletes are among the more than 850 women profiled in the book Her Story: A Timeline of the Women Who Changed America. We celebrate their outstanding accomplishments and are proud to stand on their shoulders. (answers: 1-B, 2-A, 3-D, 4-C)"

3,POLITICS,Is Anybody Out There?,"Emre Celik, ContributorPresident, Rumi Forum",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-anybody-out-there_b_6064924.html,It's unfortunate when an organization tasked with providing help to the needy must ask for help itself. It's even more unfortunate when the help it seeks is rooted in deliberate and systematic suppression.,2014-10-29,2014-10-28-fethullahgulenhizmetkimseyokmuafrica.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-28-fethullahgulenhizmetkimseyokmuafrica-thumb.jpg,"It's unfortunate when an organization tasked with providing help to the needy must ask for help itself. It's even more unfortunate when the help it seeks is rooted in deliberate and systematic suppression. In Turkey today, relief organization Kimse Yokmu, affiliated with the Fethullah Gulen inspired Hizmet movement has become the target of repeated attacks by Turkey's political neo-tyrants, the most prominent of whom is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The frustration associated with government sponsored degradation became common to members of Hizmet movement. And now, these same frustrations are being felt by charitable organizations affiliated with the movement, including Kimse Yokmu, which loosely translates to, ""Is anybody out there?"" These words -- originally uttered by those trapped under the rubble of hundreds of apartments and homes after the horrific 1999 earthquake in Turkey -- became the signature phrase of a charity telethon to raise funds for the disaster and eventually became the name of the fully fledged relief organization. Since then, the charity group has grown into Turkey's largest NGO based relief organization, active across six continents with projects in more than 100 countries.Since an investigation implicated the sons of Turkey's highest-ranking officials, Erdogan has set about to destroy not only the movement itself, but all organizations with any degree of affiliation. The President has shown little reserve in his tactics, repeatedly resorting to slander and hate speech when speaking about Mr. Gulen and the movement during speeches at political rallies and interviews for television.Some may question the veracity of the word ""tyrant."" An outside observer might wonder whether a popularly-elected leader could, over the course of 12 years, be capable of tyranny. Plato and Aristotle define a tyrant as, ""one who rules without law, looks to his own advantage rather than that of his subjects, and uses extreme and cruel tactics -- against his own people as well as others."" By using the power of his office to overthrow a civilian organization committed to the values of education, philanthropy and interfaith dialogue, Erdogan has certainly earned the title of tyrant. Focused on the promotion of unfounded and outrageous accusations, Erdogan has turned Turkey into an illiberal democracy, sacrificing the principles of due processes, free press, right of assembly and societal harmony.Since the December 17, 2013 corruption probe, Erdogan has made the movement his number one target. As the primary recipient of his attacks, members of the Hizmet movement have emerged in a precarious position. Although it may be tempting to succumb to Erdogan's bouts by either giving in or fighting back, the principles outlined by Mr. Gulen explain that each individual has a basic responsibility to contribute to the betterment of society. Responding to Erdogan by either accepting defeat or committing to rebuttal would violate this responsibility. Instead, members of the Hizmet movement have stayed true to their promise of living life for the benefit of others and continue to operate in spite of verbal and legal assaults. During the demolition of school buildings and attacks on Bank Asya, Hizmet participants rallied together and kept morale high. Most recently, a government-initiated decision to cancel Kimse Yokmu's permission to create relief campaigns associated with Eid al Ahda (the Muslim festival of sacrifice that initiates an important charitable period when money and food is donated to the poor) challenged the moral compasses of members of the movement. Nevertheless, the organization channeled its strength and stayed true to its cause in the face of threat, collecting twice as much as it had last year during the same period. However, the strength and resources of the Turkish government must not be underestimated. As the movement continues to serve communities in more than 150 nations across hundreds of cities, towns and municipalities, the global community must come to recognize the legitimate threat posed to its existence. If successful in his pursuit, the wider civil society landscape in Turkey will have lost one of its greatest proponents and the fate of Turkey's democracy will remain in a precarious state. In this scenario, Erdogan will have defeated a group focused on upholding the rights of civil society and democratic values in Turkey and promoting the protection of basic human rights and values around the world. Civil society building initiatives sponsored by the movement have transformed communities by way of investment in education, intercultural dialogue and community service from Nepal to New Zealand; from Nigeria to New York.For the sake of Turkey's future and the global need for groups committed to building strong and resilient communities, we must now ask the following question: Is anybody out there?See related Huffington Post blog posts: Hate Speech is Undermining Turkey's Fragile Democracy Fethullah Gulen's Message Condemning ISIS Appears in 5 U.S. Dailies Today Fethullah Gulen: From Izmir to the Global Hizmet Movement"
4,ARTS,Filmmaker Judy Irving - on 'Pelican Dreams',"Sean Martinfield, ContributorSan Francisco cultural critic",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/filmmaker-judy-irving-on-_b_6064842.html,"Sometimes the answer just falls out of the sky.

It's clear and obvious -- maybe standing in front of you. Like, love-at-first-sight. Six years ago, there was a brief story on local broadcast news about a pelican that had stopped traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge. The bird had settled onto the slow right lane and no matter the blare of horns from approaching traffic or the free advice from nearby pedestrians and cyclists -- the pelican had had enough. 'I'm done.' The police were fast on the scene. The bird resisted just a little in being apprehended, but surrendered under a fluffy blue towel and was then whisked away into custody. Turns out, she was a minor and starving. ""Gigi"" gets arrested on the Golden Gate Bridge. Photo, Pelican Media""A friend of mine was in that traffic jam,"" said filmmaker Judy Irving. She e-mailed me and said - 'You'll never guess why I was held up in traffic on the bridge today. A pelican landed in the roadway.' I quickly got on the phone and called the Bridge people and tried to find out where they had taken the bird after they arrested her. The film was shot with a little pocket camera or cell phone by two people who were riding their bike across Golden Gate Bridge. My husband [Mark Bittner, star of Judy's award-winning documentary, The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill] found it on YouTube. We got in touch with them and they allowed us to use it. It's the title sequence of the movie.Pelican Dreams unfolds the private lives and public hazards of California brown pelicans. Currently in release, the seventy-nine minute documentary balances the pelicans' intimate exchanges and community interactions, along with thrilling views of California's coastal areas that makes up their habitats. From San Francisco Bay to Morro Bay, the Channel Islands National Park and down into Baja -- Judy Irving's Pelican Dreams is a six-year odyssey of personal challenge, unexpected networking and controlled management of rapidly changing recording devices, filming techniques and media files. Nesting Pelicans on the Channel Islands. Photo, Pelican Media""When I started this movie,"" said Judy during our recent interview, I was using sixteen millimeter. I loved it, I was used to it. I had been shooting sixteen millimeter film my entire career. It has deep rich color and it looks fantastic. I shot the entire breeding and nest-building, the little chicks and young birds learning to fly -- all that stuff from the Channel Islands on sixteen millimeter film. That was in 2009. I'm really happy I did that. Even after you transfer it from the negative to HD -- because the film ended up in high definition -- it still looks great and the color is richer than HD-originated footage. Go figure! Then my lab [Monaco] closed here in San Francisco. I had to send the stuff to L.A. I was the last person standing still shooting in sixteen millimeter. It was ridiculous!In spite of that, the finished look of Pelican Dreams is beautifully consistent. Judy credits the results to her esteemed colorist, Gary Coates, who was able to blend all her various formats, enhance certain images and do color corrections. The music soundtrack, composed and recorded by local Niles Canyon resident Bruce Kaphan, completely supports the dramatic arc of the narrative. Acclaimed sound mixer, Sam Lehmer, corralled the foley, tweaks and tracks into the 5:1 surround mix for the theatrical release and stereo mix for the forthcoming DVD. But our spiritual link to the story begins with ""Gigi"" -- from the Golden Gate Bridge -- whose little eyes are so helpless and appealing. What follows is an adventure of abundance, care and co-operation which allows Gigi to recover and grow up in -- after all, a most delightful way.""You should eat!"" admonishes Monte Merrick, as Gigi waddles toward a buffet of anchovies. Monte was her caretaker at International Bird Rescue in Fairfield. After determining that she had not been injured, but was very dehydrated and extremely thin, he opens her pouch and pours in a healthy dose of Pedialyte.""I decided to follow that bird,"" says Judy. I tracked her to Wildcare in San Rafael. I knew about Wildcare because I had once picked up a common murre, another seabird, off the beach near Rodeo Lagoon. I caught up with her in Fairfield, where she had been transferred to International Bird Rescue. I'd had lunch with the head of it two weeks before Gigi had landed on the bridge. I told Jay Holkum, who ran International Bird Rescue that I wanted to make a pelican movie, but that I didn't know where to start. He said as soon as I figured it out I could come and hangout in the aviary as long as I didn't hassle the birds. So, it was really cool that she ended up there. I was allowed to sit in this wonderful hundred foot-long pelican aviary they have. It is long enough so that when the birds start getting better, they have a nice distance to fly from perch to perch. Judy Irving and Gigi. Why the long face?

As a descendant of 30-million-years worth of pelicans, Morro shows us how to live in the moment. Though not with his own kind, Morro has acquired an Education Permit. At least once a month, Morro is chauffeured out for brief cameo appearances and then returns home to his pool, lounge chair, a full-length mirror and (for now) a stroll with a star-struck duck.When I started the film, I just wanted to do a Valentine to pelicans. I was pretty ignorant about their life -- the survival challenges they have to go through everyday. As I spread out my shooting schedule from Baja to Washington state and started following their migratory route and learning more about them, I gradually came to understand how many problems they face along the Pacific coast -- most of them human-caused. I couldn't leave that out. This is part of the pelican's life. When a pelican's life is good, it is very, very good. They surf the wave crests, they soar, they dive, they get fish, they sleep comfortably with their beak tucked into their feathers. When a pelican's life is bad, it can be very, very bad. 'I've got a fishhook caught in my pouch -- I have a line wrapped around my leg -- I ran into a snowstorm from climate change -- I got frostbite -- I was diving and all of a sudden I was diving into an oil slick, lost my waterproofing and got really cold.' There's tons of problems out there for them. They do the best they can. They're trying to survive. I feel it's all part of the story. You just develop more respect for them the more you know about what they have to go through. Morro (as himself). Pelican Dreams.

From the roasted figs with smoked feta cheese to the scallops with quail egg and cauliflower, this was a meal in which every course was full of fresh flavors and unexpected, delightful combinations. Most surprising, my daughter was able to have a vegetarian version of each delicious dish.Because we're still talking about that meal, I wrote to Executive Chef Michael Stanton to gush a little and find out more. Here's what he had to say, along with a special recipe.Lois Alter Mark: Portland is such a foodie city. Why do you think that is, and how does that impact your menu?Michael Stanton: It's about the passion of the people and the bounty that we have available to us. With the amazing products we get from the Pacific Northwest, we're able to buy the freshest in season product available for our ever-updating menu.LAM: I love that, according to the Heathman website, your philosophy is ""organic."" Those fresh, vivid flavors are apparent in every delicious dish of yours. Tell us what organic means to you, and why it's so important.MS: I believe that the best flavors come from procuring the best products possible and keeping the integrity of those ingredients on our plates, authentically showcasing their truest expression.LAM: What are some of your favorite local ingredients to use? Are there ingredients that you weren't able to get as easily when you worked in other parts of the country?MS: Salmon, salmon, salmon! Coming from the East Coast originally, as well as spending years living in the Southwest, I had never experienced the quality of the wild salmon that we have available here. Of course, I'm also excited by the seasonal aspect of produce we wait for - peas, berries, melons, mushrooms, and huckleberries, to name a few.LAM: Have you changed your approach to cooking at all since being in Portland?MS: No. My approach has always been that cooking should be simple, fresh and clean. I combine classic French training with the bounty of local ingredients to showcase this approach in my dishes.LAM: As you know, my daughter is a vegetarian and she is still talking about the fact that you made her the best meal of her life (that's a direct quote). How have people's eating habits changed what you cook? And how were you able to pretty much replicate my meat and fish-filled meal vegetarian-style? MS: Our customers' eating habits are always at the forefront of what we do on a daily basis. We continually look at new ways of doing things to fulfill and elevate expectations.As for the replication of meat dishes for vegetarians, we think of the meats as a form of protein, and we look closely at what we would do with these proteins. For example, smoking firm tofu prior to seasoning and pan roasting yields a similar characteristic to a scallop. Similarly, marinating and grilling a large meaty mushroom such as a king oyster or portabello, gives you a similar texture to a delicate piece of meat. From there, you can build the remaining components of a dish.LAM: How often do you change your menu? How do you decide what to include?MS: We change the menu quite often for different reasons. Sometimes the season has finished and the seasonal ingredient is no longer available, or a new season has begun and we've received beautiful produce. Other times dishes just don't evolve well or we want to do something new for our diners.LAM: What are some of the most popular dishes on your menu? What's your personal favorite?MS: Our menu changes often, but I will usually go with a braised dish at any given time. Today, that would be the pork shank. The next most popular will usually be the newest thing we put on the menu. Today, that would be our newly reworked Bouillabaisse. It's a fisherman's stew, still made from a classic recipe of fresh fish bones and saffron, but finished with a house made roasted tomato paste with saffron and yuzu koshu. It makes for a nice contrast of flavors while keeping with the fresh simple seafood stew for our diners.LAM: When people talk about your food, how would you like to hear them describe it?MS: Well-balanced with clean, bold flavors.Speaking of which, enjoy this special dish from Chef Michael Stanton.Asparagus and Bay Shrimp Salad with Lemon Aioli Serves 4.20 ea Asparagus - Medium, peeled and blanched8 oz Bay Shrimp 1 head Frisée  1 Tbl Celery - fine diced 1 Tbl shallot - Fine dice 1 sprig Parsley - chopped 2 Tbl Extra Virgin Olive Oil 2 Tbl lemon Aioli¼ cup Pasturized Egg Yolks 1 Tbl Dijon Mustard 1 Tbl Lemon Zest Juice of 1 Lemon 1 ½ cup Blended Olive oil 75/25 Pinch of SaltMethod:1.

6,COLLEGE,Consultant's Report Blames Sexual Assault Activists For Campus Unrest,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/occidental-sexual-assault-report-gomez-smith_n_6065176.html,,2014-10-29,"A sign for Occidental College stands on the college campus in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Friday, April 19, 2013. A group of Occidental students and alumni filed a Title IX complaint with the Education Department on April 18 saying the school doesnt meet federal standards for preventing and responding to rapes and other sexual assaults on campus. Photographer: Patrick Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae52892600003500812ba2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a report issued Tuesday, two consultants hired to conduct a review of sexual misconduct at Occidental College contend that a rape survivor activist group at the Los Angeles school is creating a polarized environment that's preventing administrators from improving how sexual assault is handled.Skeptics, however, say the consultants may be offering a dishonest version of events, since they were hired and paid to conduct their review by Occidental College itself.Occidental President Jonathan Veitch commissioned Gina Smith and Leslie Gomez, two Philadelphia-based attorneys with the firm Pepper Hamilton LLP, in March 2013 to evaluate the college's methods for handling sexual misconduct and offer insight on how it could improve. The attorneys, who have been hired by a number of other colleges for similar purposes, began their evaluation just prior to the filing of two federal complaints alleging that Occidental had mishandled a number of cases of sexual assault. Those complaints resulted in separate concurrent investigations by the U.S. Department of Education. The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights finished its on-campus work this summer, and both the complainants and the college are awaiting the final results of that investigation. The Clery investigation is still underway.The Pepper-Hamilton report, meanwhile, alleges that the Oxy Sexual Assault Coalition (OSAC), a campus activist group, impeded Smith and Gomez' work, used unspecified tactics to gain attention while alienating the rest of the college and failed to engage in good faith with school leaders. The consultants also criticize reporters, arguing that media coverage of college sexual assault -- not only at Occidental but in general -- fails to capture the complexities of dealing with the issue.Smith and Gomez accuse the activists of taking an uncooperative approach to their dealings with the administration, and write that ""the very tactics used to gain attention to the issues will stand in the way of candid and collaborative communication between activists and administrators."" The pair claims there were students, staff and faculty who declined ""to engage in conversation or campus efforts because of fear of OSAC's response,"" although they do not elaborate on what OSAC was allegedly doing to intimidate these parties.The members of OSAC, for their part, were skeptical of Smith and Gomez because they were being paid directly by the college. The attorneys concede in their report that some on campus felt the ""very fact that the College engaged us meant that we could not be viewed as objective.""OSAC is not alone in feeling this way. Among many sexual assault survivors and advocates, Smith and Gomez have developed a reputation for glossing over the shortcomings of the schools that hire them.Smith and Gomez claim repeatedly that OSAC blocked them from speaking with sexual assault survivors involved in the complaint -- an assertion that Caroline Heldman, a professor who has helped to spearhead sexual assault activism at Occidental, calls a flat-out lie. According to Heldman, she and other faculty members offered to arrange meetings between survivors and the consultants on three occasions in April 2013, early on in Smith and Gomez's review of Occidental. Heldman says the consultants did not follow up on the invitation until July 30, when an assistant to Veitch emailed OSAC. At that point, Heldman told the assistant that OSAC would decline meetings.In their report, Smith and Gomez contend that it was clear from the beginning that OSAC faculty aimed to prevent them from speaking with survivors in the complaint.Contrary to the report's claim that Smith and Gomez were never able to interview OSAC members, faculty at Occidental say the consultants did end up speaking with some students involved with the activist group in 2014.Heldman considered the report a ""character assassination"" of OSAC and the complainants, which she said was unfair since ""the only reason [Smith and Gomez are] taking a look at this is because of the activists.""Smith and Gomez told HuffPost Wednesday that for more than a year, they submitted written requests to meet with members of OSAC and sexual assault survivors involved in the complaint.""We could not have been more explicit and clear that we wanted this involvement and input,"" said Gomez.The Pepper-Hamilton report does list a number of positive steps Occidental has taken, including hiring several new staff members to handle sexual violence, reworking the school's sexual misconduct policy, expanding the website that assault survivors use to report incidents and offering training sessions for faculty and staff. The school has also received a $300,000 three-year grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to address rape on campus, and has reviewed its own crime figures and concluded that it initially under-reported the number of on-campus sexual assaults to the government.The 130-page report does not detail what, if anything, administrators did wrong.""At Occidental, we have observed a strong commitment by the College, President Veitch, the Board of Trustees, senior leadership, the Title IX and Clery response teams, the Sexual Misconduct Advisory Board and the many dedicated students, staff and faculty who have taken earnest and significant steps to implement meaningful changes,"" the report says.Smith and Gomez note in the report that their last visit to the Occidental campus was in October 2013.Since then, the college administration has been accused of secretly tracking anonymous sexual assault reports. In addition, college trustees were captured on tape getting into verbal arguments with students and faculty, and instructors have alleged that their on-campus offices were broken into.In settling a lawsuit in September 2013, Occidental also placed a gag order on the sexual assault victims who were the plaintiffs in the suit, thereby preventing them from discussing anything that happened with their cases at the college.Smith and Gomez looked at 17 sexual misconduct cases in their review and found that two-thirds of the investigations were concluded within or close to the 60-day time frame recommended by the Education Department -- a finding that contradicts the federal complaint's claim that ""most"" of the school's investigations stretched beyond the two-month mark.The consultants' report does not comment on the validity of sanctions handed out by the university to students found responsible for sexual assault, although this is another area where Occidental has received pointed criticism. Complainants have noted that one student found responsible for sexual assault was punished with a five-page book report.The Pepper-Hamilton report does describe a student found guilty of ""non-consensual sexual intercourse"" who was given a one-semester suspension. The accused student appealed this decision and obtained a reduced sanction of 50 hours of community service and ""an educational project."" The suspension was rescinded. The report suggests ""consideration of new evidence"" as an explanation for why Occidental gave the student a more lenient punishment. Smith and Gomez hoped anyone who took the time to fully understand the context would note the attorneys gave credit to the activists for speaking out and for making recommendations about what should change at Occidental."

For publication rights, contact JD Lasica at jdlasica@gmail.com.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb485ad2400003100561a7e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At a loft New York City's Chelsea neighborhood, Fred Armisen played a racing game, getting coached from an unlikely source. ""You gotta get the Lambo,"" Ice-T said over his shoulder. ""The Corvette sucks.""Armisen followed Ice-T's advice, but it proved futile. He still lost a bet.On Monday night, Microsoft unveiled it's newest Xbox One game, ""Sunset Overdrive,"" to a handful of lucky celebrities who can't shut up about video games. Earlier in the night, Armisen -- perhaps best known for his role on ""Portlandia"" -- sat down with friend and ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Bobby Moynihan to test out the new game. The two spoke to The Huffington Post when not distracted by the intricacies of grinding on a rail while shooting really angry, really energetic mutants in ""Sunset Overdrive.""""I get offers to go to fashion events and other stuff,"" Armisen said. ""But I love video games so much, so when I got this offer, I said, 'Are you kidding me? I'm going.'""Not that he was a gamer early on: Armisen said he didn't really fall in love with video games until he started playing ""Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.""""I remember thinking, 'I wish there was a game where you could just shoot someone,' and then I found it,"" Armisen said.He loves GTA so much, in fact, that he's done voice work for the series, tackling roles including ""Pervert,"" ""Hot Dog Vendor,"" and ""Internet Nerd.""Moynihan, on the other hand, enjoys the simplicity of poorly made games.""I like the shitty games based on movies that take an hour to beat,"" Moynihan said. While the two comedians took turns passing off the controller, behind them, Ice-T cursed wildly, having gotten last place in ""Forza"" once again. Ice-T focuses on Forza, unable to accept defeat""I'm a real-life gamer,"" Ice-T said. ""A lot of people think gamers are just nerds or geeks. I spend a lot of time on tour busses, what do you think I do?""As Ice-T turned his attention to ""Sunset Overdrive,"" The Huffington Post couldn't help but challenge Armisen to a friendly $5 bet. It was simple: all Armisen had to do was not get last place in Forza.""That's it?"" Armisen asked, incredulous. ""I just have to not get last place?""He was confident and focused as he picked his vehicle, headphones on and mouth slightly agape in what a newly formed crowd around him started to refer to as ""gamer face.""""Just wait till he gets to the rain-slicked roads,"" Ice-T whispered.Sure enough, Armisen wiped his car. Again, and again, and again. Despite his valiant efforts, he was forced to pay up, shaking down Moynihan for the cold hard cash.Armisen expressed his love of Ice-T's metal band, Body Count, to the legendary rapper before the two moved on to other games.Left behind, Ice-T was still invested in ""Sunset Overdrive"": ""I'll get into this game, it looks like it really moves,"" he said.After a couple drinks, Ice-T opened up about those frustrating nights when he just can't beat a level in a video game, and proudly confessed his victory dance when he finally makes some progress.""You know those levels you just can't beat?"" he said. ""You keep getting killed, you just can't get through it, so you sleep on it and think of strategies and come back the next day and win? That's when I do the Dick Dance.""The ""Dick Dance"" is exactly what it sounds like. In the privacy of his own home, Ice-T confessed to pulling out his member and doing a little ditty after beating a tough level. He says he throws his hands up and gyrates his hips a little for good measure.So what gets him so amped up?""I'm competitive,"" he said simply.""Sunset Overdrive"" is now available for the Xbox One."

10,GREEN,Saving the Canadian Polar Bear,"Cathy Kangas, ContributorMember, Board of Directors, Humane Society",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saving-the-canadian-polar_b_5946762.html,"As if it isn't bad enough that the Canadian seal hunt is the largest slaughter of marine animals in the world, now Canada is the only country still allowing polar bears to be hunted for their skins and body parts.",2014-10-28,"FILE--A polar bear mother and her two cubs walk along the shore of Hudson Bay near Churchill, Man. Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2007. U.S. government officials say the Interior Department has decided to protect the polar bear as a threatened species because of global warming. (AP Photo/Jonathan Hayward,CP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15f3b2000003000ff9fe8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As if it isn't bad enough that the Canadian seal hunt is the largest slaughter of marine animals in the world, now Canada is the only country still allowing polar bears to be hunted for their skins and body parts. Once again, Canada has come under fire from the international community because polar bears are killed for profit at a time when their very existence is threatened by global warming. At a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), both the UK and Norway demanded Canada's trade in polar bear parts come under review as it is contributing to the demise of the species.   The European Union has already placed a ban on imports from Canadian polar bears in the Kane Basin and Baffin Bay. Since 2008, the U.S. has listed polar bears as an endangered species, banning the export of polar bear parts -- known as trophies -- from Canada. A poll conducted in Canada by The Humane Society of the United States found 65 percent of Canada residents believe the polar bear must be protected as an endangered species, and killing them for trophies is inhumane and should be stopped. So what are the Canadians waiting for? According to The HSUShttp://www.humanesociety.org/animals/polar_bears/:• Canada is the only country allowing legal hunting of polar bears solely for international trade and sport. Each year, approximately 600 polar bears are killed in Canada, which results in a decline in the polar bear population from which they cannot recover.The international community is putting pressure on Canada, demanding some controls be put in place to preserves the polar bear population in a way that is consistent with their role in the ecosystem.  Additionally, Russia, Norway and The U.S., nations with polar bear populations, must demand better protection for the Canadian polar bears through an international review process. The Canadian seal hunt is nearly defunct because nations came together and banned the sale of seal products. We must now convince our neighbors to the north that the U.S., backed by the international community, will not tolerate the sale of polar bear body parts at a time when the existence of these animals is threatened by climate change It is not only humane; it is the right thing to do."
