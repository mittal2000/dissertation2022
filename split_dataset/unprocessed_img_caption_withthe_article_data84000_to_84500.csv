It has been a disaster since then. Maybe the crisis is about the idea of the euro, not just about Greece.When Greeks went to the polls last week, did anyone really imagine that they were going to vote to accept German terms to end the current round of the Greek financial crisis? In the middle of an economic depression, would Greeks really vote to cut pensions for the poorest Greeks, along with the middle class, to further cut social services and to raise taxes across the board, for the promise that -- for the moment -- they can remain members of the Eurozone?How would voters across the United States have responded back in the darkest moments of the 2008 financial crisis if our political leaders who were considering a massive bailout of our financial system had put the question to vote: Shall the U.S. Government and Federal Reserve Bank provide a couple of trillion dollars to bail out AIG, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, and other global banks who lost their shirts on complex financial bets... Of course we would have voted no. And so did the Greeks.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipris knew this. He knew that the Greek demos -- the ones who literally brought us democracy to begin with -- would not vote to assuage the Germans, to prostrate themselves before the world and apologize for their profligacy and laziness. This was not going to happen, whatever the carrot might be. He wanted a no vote, and he got a no vote.Few knew better than the Germans that this would be the outcome. After all, they too had once been a defeated people, suffering in the wake of their defeat in World War I under the cruel thumb of foreign powers. They had accepted treaty obligations under duress and built up debts that buried the German nation in a deep depression. Like the Greeks last week, the German volk did not sit back and accept responsibility for their past misdeeds and the wretchedness of their circumstances. When the opportunity came, they voted for a political party that promised relief from the Treaty of Versailles and Germany's World War I debts.Long ago, in the wake of two world wars, there was a dream of a united Europe. It was a dream of those who believed that German power in the heart of Europe would best be restrained if it were placed in the center of an economic union. And it was a dream of the French to create a third force that would counterbalance the influence of the United States on the world scene.Six years after the European Union was finally created in 1993, the euro was introduced as the common currency of 19 of the 28 member nations of the EU. But monetary unions created among otherwise independent nations are complicated concepts and historically almost never survive. When the global financial collapse came in 2008, the weaknesses of the Eurozone became pronounced. In the face of impending financial collapse across the continent, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear then as she did last week with respect to Greece: each European country is responsible for its own banks and its own debts. One nation after another bailed out their banks. There may have been a European Central Bank, but there was no European central banking system as we understand it. There was no interdependency, and -- as the Greeks learned painfully last week -- there is no deposit insurance.The financial crisis of 2008 begged the question of whether the concept of a united Europe itself had failed. Neither of the two original ambitions of a united Europe had been realized. Far from being tamed, Germany emerged as the single dominant European economic power, and on foreign policy Europe failed to emerge as a unified force in political or military terms. With respect to the rationale behind the creation of the euro, the 2008 collapse rendered quaint notions of Europe decoupling from the dollar, and as continued technological change made currency markets seamless to consumers, EU nations with their own sovereign currencies have seen no disadvantage in being outside of the monetary union.But whatever its failings, the creation of the Eurozone has been a boon for Germany. As an export-driven economy, the common currency has provided Germany with captive export markets where it can sell its goods with no fear of its currency value rising against that of nations that buy its stuff. Germany has outperformed all other countries in the Eurozone since its creation, and there are structural reasons why that go beyond traditional images of German workforce discipline and superior engineering.In the normal world -- a world of freely exchanged currencies among independent nations -- an importing nation has to purchase the currency of an exporting nation to buy the stuff it wants. That demand for the currency of the exporting nation pushes up that currency's value. If the exporting nation wants to keep the value of its currency from rising -- which would make its stuff more expensive and thus make the exporting nation less competitive -- the exporting nation has to buy something in return from the importing nation in order to keep the trading levels of the two currencies in balance. This interrelationship is central to global trade and national economic strategies.Asian nations that have prospered since World War II provide examples of how trade and currency flows work. Those nations -- like Germany -- built their economies over the past 50 years with ""export-driven"" strategies tied to a currency ""peg."" A currency peg, in this case, refers to economic policies designed to keep a given nation's currency in a stable relationship with the U.S. dollar. In order to sustain an export-driven economic growth strategy over time, as a nation's exports to the United States grow, that nation must balance the upward pressure on its own currency by recycling those dollars back into the United States, whether by purchasing goods and services, buying U.S. Treasury securities or other means.In Europe, the creation of a single currency has allowed Germany to avoid the need to adopt economic policies to manage the value of its currency relative to its trading partners. Since the creation of the Eurozone, Germany has been able to sell as much stuff as it wanted to across Europe with no resulting pressure on the Deutsche Mark, for the simple reason that there no longer is a Deutsche Mark. As an export engine, Germany has been able to build its manufacturing economy at the expense of other European economies with no fear of having to address a rising currency value.For the weaker, southern European economies in particular, being in the Eurozone has been problematic. Open trade and currency markets provide important feedback loops to participating nations that guide them toward policies that will balance currency relationships and bi-lateral capital flows over time. Stronger countries have incentives to invest in weaker countries where costs are lower, while weaker countries have incentives to improve labor productivity and adopt other policies to support economic growth. The creation of a currency union disrupts those feedback loops and distorts decision-making in each country, as has been evident in Greece.Over its fifteen years as a Eurozone country, Greece has underperformed a wide range of regional non-Euro countries, including those in and out of the European Union. The histogram below presents data from the International Monetary Fund that suggests that European countries outside of the Eurozone have fared far better than Greece over the past 15 years. Many of those countries faced far more difficult social and economic challenges -- particularly those emerging from the Soviet block -- than Greece has faced, yet they adapted to the demands of international markets.The measures that Germany has demanded that Greece implement -- reduced pensions, labor market reforms, delayed retirement -- mirror those that currency and capital markets would have pushed Greece to make if it was not in a currency union. A central element of the crisis in Greece has been the problem of forcing difficult decisions through a political process -- as reflected in the Greek vote against capitulating to German demands -- instead of making those difficult decisions in response to market forces, as did those non-euro nations illustrated in the histogram.The Greece financial crisis has become a long-running morality tale, pitting the profligacy and obstinnce of the Greeks against the fiscal rectitude of the Germans, but it is not that simple. It is true that the Greeks are profligate. They refuse to pay the taxes that they owe. They retire too early, and they have little regard for the rules and regulations of financial prudence that are innate to the Germans. All of that may be true, but is secondary to whether membership in the Eurozone has benefitted Greece relative to the status quo ante. The graphic below illustrates the point. It presents a comparison of the trends in industrial production in Greece and Germany before and after the adoption of the euro by Greece. Few people seem to recall Greece when it was a poor, developing country with dirt roads everywhere and few signs of affluence. Voluntary payment of taxes -- what we take for granted in the United States -- is the exception not the rule globally, so that alone is not a measure of economic maturity. Indeed, non-collection of taxes -- translated into a low effective tax rate -- should be a boon to economic growth, not a deterrent. As illustrated in this graph, Greece had experienced a long period of industrial growth prior to joining the Eurozone, as GDP per capita almost tripled over the 15-year period from 1985 to 2001, the year Greece adopted the euro, from $4,832 to $12,419.The underlying question raised by the Greek financial crisis has been largely ignored, which is whether Greek adoption of the euro -- or even the creation of the Eurozone at all -- was a bad idea to begin with, and one that will not get better with time. This is the question that Germany must fear, that Greece, and others, ultimately come to realize that it is Germany that has benefited most from the creation of the euro, and that others, particularly the weakest economies, may have paid a steep price to be members of the Eurozone club."

The Republican Party has become a resistance movement, and Trump is leading the resistance. But is Trump a serious threat?",2015-07-12,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pauses during a long applause as he speaks before a crowd of over 3,500 Saturday, July 11, 2015, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb905fc24000050009903ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There's a reason why Donald Trump is stirring up the Republican race. The Republican Party has become a resistance movement, and Trump is leading the resistance.What it's resisting is the rise of the New America. That's the coalition of groups that were historically marginalized: immigrants, racial and religious minorities, gays, working women, single mothers, young people and ""unchurched"" Americans with no religious affiliation. It's a coalition united by a commitment to diversity and inclusion. And deeply opposed to symbols of exclusion like the Confederate flag, hostility to immigrants and homophobia. The coalition is growing in numbers as the U.S. becomes more racially diverse, women become more independent, gays come out of the closet and more people lose their religion. The New America came to power with the nation's first African-American President. President Obama's legitimacy is under constant challenge -- most prominently by Donald Trump, who has never given up disputing Obama's legal qualifications to serve.Republican leaders know that conservative hostility to immigrants and minorities will doom their party. It's the same mistake Republicans made 100 years ago when they were unwelcoming to immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. Those immigrants and their children became the base of the New Deal Democratic majority that dominated American politics from the 1930s to the 1970s.Then, as now, Republicans staunchly defended the Old America, which sees itself as under assault.  The Hollywood celebrity speaker at the last Republican National Convention was the very symbol of the Old America -- Clint Eastwood, age 82.  The Democrats' celebrity speaker was Scarlett Johansson, age 27.The Republican Party chairman has urged Trump to ""tone it down"" to avoid damaging the party brand. Instead, Trump has been racheting it up. ""We have to take back the heart of our country,"" Trump told a rally in Phoenix last weekend, to which the audience responded with cheers of ""USA! USA!""The latest Economist-YouGov poll puts Trump at the head of the GOP pack for the 2016 nomination. Trump's favorability among Republicans jumped from 38 percent in June to 49 percent this month. His highest ratings come from the the party's base: ""very conservative"" Republicans, Tea Party supporters and Republicans over 65. Literally, the Old America.Trump evokes conservatives' longing for an America that dominates the world with its wealth and power. ""We don't have victories any more. We used to have victories,"" he told the crowd in Arizona. ""We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again."" Trump divides the world into winners and losers. He says he can make the U.S. a winner. Why? Because he's a winner. ""I'm really rich,"" he boasted. Which, by his calculation, makes him smarter than everybody else. He claimed, ""We need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal.""Who would be better at dealing with Iran than the consummate deal-maker? Trump pledged, ""We won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry who has no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal.""Trump's claims are completely ridiculous, but they have tremendous appeal to conservatives who see their America disappearing. What unites Republicans today is the call for resistance. Resist Obamacare. Resist immigration reform. Resist same-sex marriage. Resist Islamic radicalism. Put up a wall of resistance to anything President Obama wants to get out of Congress.Is Trump a serious threat? Only 18 percent of Americans have a ""very favorable"" opinion of Donald Trump. Forty-six percent are ""very unfavorable."" The base of Trump's support is the limit of his support. He can get support from staunch conservatives who rally to his call for resistance. But he can't get support from anybody else."

Some of the exercises, scheduled from July 15 to Sept. 15, will be held in this city located east of Austin.At an April town hall meeting in Bastrop, attendees peppered a military spokesman with pointed questions, including: ""Are you planning on detaining or rounding up any American citizens?""Rosalie Howerton, a 74-year-old retired nurse from Tyler, Texas, wrote the governor to say she was worried about the drills.""I've gotten to the point where I don't trust my government,"" she said. ""I don't trust Obama. I think he is looking toward calling martial law to stop the next election from taking place.""In an online comment about Jade Helm, Bastrop resident Josh Munyon wrote: ""It's something that the rest of the country should be worried about. They already have FEMA trains that oddly enough look like the trains that the Nazis used in ww2.""One particular sticking point has been an Army map that lists Texas as ""hostile"" territory.""Such labeling tends to make people who have grown leery of federal government overreach become suspicious of whether their big brother government anticipates certain states may start another civil war or be overtaken by foreign radical Islamist elements which have been reported to be just across our border,"" Louie Gohmert, a Republican congressman from Texas, said recently in a statement.The Texas Republican Party platform has long reflected concerns over federal and international overreach, with calls for a U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations and the elimination of the Federal Reserve.When a U.N. agency named the Alamo, the location of a famed 1836 battle in the fight for Texas Independence, a World Heritage Site earlier this month, some Texans saw the move as a prelude to an international takeover. FRIENDS ON THE FRINGEThe U.S. Army Special Operations Command has categorically denied there is anything nefarious about the drills, saying they are training exercises, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc said there was no truth to the rumors of a tunnel network being built under its stores.Jade Helm will be held on public and private land, with the permission of landowners. The military said Army Special Operations Forces will train in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado, with the terrain intended to replicate areas where soldiers find themselves operating overseas.Fears from constituents, however, have drawn a response from politicians eager not to alienate right-wing voters. In a move a Dallas Morning News editorial called ""cringe-worthy,"" Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, said he would dispatch the Texas State Guard to monitor Jade Helm to make sure it does not impinge on Texans' freedom.Placating such views could pay off for Republicans, who dominate state politics and often fight their most difficult battles in primaries where campaigns typically take a hard turn to the right.A poll from the Texas Tribune and the University of Texas showed that 39 percent of registered voters and 85 percent of the right-wing Tea Party group supported Abbott's move on Jade Helm.""Republican leaders don't want to do something that antagonizes these groups to such as extent that they rally around an opponent in the Republican primary,"" said Mark Jones, who chairs the Department of Political Sciences at Rice University in Houston.""The conspiracy theories tend to get amplified in Texas because we are a large state, with very active groups.""Despite the predictions of doom, many Bastrop residents are wary but not overly concerned.""We support our military, and they have to train somewhere,"" said Pam Ferguson, owner of the High Cotton antique store. ""It might as well be here.""And while suspicion of the drills has run rampant among customers of Crosshairs Texas, the town's only gun store, sales there have not increased, said owner Troy Michalik.""I don't think we are going to wake up next week and find tanks and roadblocks and martial law,"" he said. ""But at the same time, that does not mean that we should not be diligent and vigilant and keep an eye about what is going on.""

However, based on developments already underway, one can surely make several observations, which do not just concern Greece but more broadly the European Union and the way a crisis is being managed within the framework of a highly complex geopolitical situation with many implications. The events taking place relating to the Greek and European economy have a wider impact, and are influencing entities and communities far beyond the Old World. Observation one. As former president of the European Commission Jacques Delors emphasized in his recent article to Le Monde (co-signed by Pascal Lamy and Antonio Vitorino), the ""Greek drama is not and will not just be Greek: it has and will have repercussions for the whole of Europe, of which Greece is a part by virtue of its history and geography."" Indeed. Greece is at a crossroads, between Europe, the Balkans, the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East -- between the West and the East. It is at the junction of important geostrategic interests. It is situated in an area where the established interests of the great powers are pitted against those of rising regional powers, against the backdrop of a reemergence of blind religious fundamentalism, in the form of the Islamic State -- a serious menace to universal human rights and a threat to the principles and values of rationalism. The weakening of a country in this specific area and under these specific circumstances would constitute not just a failure, but a choice with grave strategic consequences. Consequences which would be felt over time, both on the European continent, already facing the open wound of Ukraine, and more broadly, in the soft underbelly of the southeastern Mediterranean, where intersecting energy strategies will determine the wider stakes (in the region) during the 21st century. Observation two. It is abundantly clear that the ""Greek question"" is not limited exclusively and solely to its economic dimension. The debt crisis, and its handling, is but one facet of a broader issue, which has to do with the need for deep structural reforms at many levels (institutional, practical, civil service, etc.) -- reforms which should have been implemented many decades ago and which, however, cannot be achieved in the span of a few months. They constitute a long-term undertaking, which requires, first and foremost, the mobilization of all forces within Greek society, with contributions (in the form of knowhow, transfer of best practices) from those partners in the Ee that have the knowledge, experience, and ability to support such a Greek endeavor. Observation three. In the final analysis, as Nobel Laureate and professor of economics Joseph Stiglitz stressed in reference to the Greek question, ""it is about power and democracy much more than money and economics."" The solution to the Greek debt problem is therefore not technocratic but rather a matter of political will -- which, moreover, has always been the case when the European project has faced major crises. The solution offered by European leaders, particularly during the first decades of the project, was political. As was the case with ""Monnet's Method,"" which incorporates crisis into its approach, opting for small steps toward a common goal.Provided of course there is solidarity in action -- a vital element which must not be overlooked. Particularly at times such as these when the future of an undertaking is being judged, which will either meet the goals of its founders -- democracy and solidarity for the prosperity of the people of Europe -- or enter on a path of decay. Because the Greek question is deeply European.This post originally appeared on HuffPost Greece and was translated into English. "

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0f2e200000e500ff324a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina, where the Confederate flag was celebrated as the symbol of the South. In school, we were taught about the Civil War and yet it seemed removed. In my young mind, I understood that slavery was bad, but I also was living in a world where slavery was long over. What I did not recognize was the discrimination around me -- socially and economically.My elementary and middle school opened in 1954, the same year as the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education, which ended legal segregation in public schools. But even in 1968, when I entered kindergarten, there wasn't a single black student in my school. By the mid-1970s, there were just a handful.The only black person I knew intimately was our housekeeper, Velma.She laughed and played with me and my two younger sisters, and scolded us when necessary. We'd come home from school to the smells of her delicious home-cooked meals. When my parents left on long trips she would stay with us and take us to her house. Her home was my first realization that everyone's house was not like mine. The furnishings were old, the wallpaper aged, and the only heat was in the living room, courtesy of a wood-burning stove. Chickens ran through her yard. Her neighbors were all black. I was seeing segregation and its economic impacts and yet I could not fully comprehend what she went through in a socially segregated world.In 1981, during my senior year of high school, I interned at the South Carolina House of Representatives. Under the Capitol Dome, three flags flew: the American flag, the palmetto and crescent flag of South Carolina, and the Confederate battle flag. It was the battle flag that was the one most requested by constituents.I left in that fall for Emory University. I wanted nothing more than to fit in. I went through sorority rush and was overjoyed when I was accepted into Kappa Kappa Gamma. I was even more thrilled when I was invited to the Kappa Alpha fraternity's spring formal. The formal invitation to the ball was hand-delivered to each recipient on sorority row by fraternity members on horseback wearing Confederate uniforms.I went to a costume store and tried on antebellum hoop skirt dresses and gloves. I never once considered what this event was celebrating; I was focused on being a part of the crowd. I had gone from nerdy awkward teenager to believing I was special -- truly a ""belle.""The night of the ball, my date picked me up at my dorm. There we were, heading to a downtown hotel, him in his Confederate uniform, me in my hoop skirt. and I left in my big hoop skirt to a downtown Atlanta hotel. There was a lot of drinking. At one point on the dance floor, my date, drunk as hell, ripped open his Confederate uniform to reveal a T-shirt underneath. It had been made by an Emory club, celebrating a cultural pride week. The T-shirt read, ""Be Happy You Are Jewish."" He perhaps meant it as a joke, but I wasn't laughing. I took it to mean he was making fun of my Jewish religion and my heritage. At that moment it might as well have been a swastika, or the anonymous note my parents received when they moved into a new neighborhood in South Carolina years before. The note said, ""We know you're here.""The next day it hit me: What was I thinking? I was upset at his shirt, but hadn't given a second thought to the Confederate uniform. I deserved no sympathy.At Emory I was studying history. During my sophomore year, I took Professor Dan Carter's course on Southern U.S. history and read his book Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South. The 1937 trial in Alabama of several young black men who were innocent of the rape of a white woman changed the course of my studies -- and of my awareness of race in America.I continued to take every class on Southern U. S. History at Emory. Professor James Roark opened my eyes to the realities of slavery. I wrote a paper about a labor activist, J.C. Artemus, founder of South Carolina first black carpenter's union. My research connected back to my childhood, as his son was the cameraman on the public broadcast children's show I worked on when I was a child. Congressman John Lewis, then an Atlanta city council member, spent several hours with us talking about his time in the Civil Rights Movement and his more recent concerns about Atlanta's homeless population.Learning history awakens, enlightens and forces introspection. For that to happen, it cannot tolerate the adoption of a symbol without also knowing the truth about it. When historical items become icons, the facts take a back seat to dogma. The truth is sacrificed.South Carolina finally has taken down the symbol that when I was young I did not fully understand. Some people learn the true history and change. Others live with the myth and perpetuate hate and discrimination, and, in its darkest form, violence.It's now time for the rest of us to evolve fully and to understand the hate and the oppression such a symbol represents. It belongs in the museum -- and not in any state-sanctioned place in a nation that ostensibly celebrates freedom.This post originally appeared on Atlanta.--B.J.

A version of this first appeared in Spiegel Online. More than 5,000 Albanians stormed foreign embassies in Tirana in July 1990. Here a women enters the West German compound. © Lothar ParzellerErvis Gega was 16 years old in summer 1990 when hundreds of frustrated Albanians, craving to rejoin the world, began storming foreign embassies in their capital. Gega and her relatives watched the news on Italian television from their hometown and quickly made up their minds. A family of musicians, they had long suffered under Communist rule.The Berlin Wall had fallen eight months before but Albania's Communist party was holding on. Statues of Stalin and the long-time dictator Enver Hoxha, who died in 1985, still stood in this closed and repressive Balkan state.Gega grabbed her Chinese-made violin and boarded a train for Tirana with her parents, uncle and aunt. When they arrived, security forces had surrounded the diplomatic quarter but the family slipped the police some money and clambered over the wall into the West German embassy.Within a few days, more than 3,000 Albanians had joined Gega and her family, especially after an asylum-seeker rammed the embassy's wall with a truck. Hundreds of other Albanians had occupied the embassies of the Greeks, Italians and French. Four people jumped into the Cuban embassy but the Cubans threw them back. A man drove a truck through the wall of the West German embassy on July 3, 1990. Three people also entered the East German compound. © Lothar ParzellerPolice Want to FleeFor the most part, the police showed restraint. Even if ordered to shoot, low morale would have likely prevented security forces from opening fire. The police and soldiers also wanted to leave.Some western diplomats encouraged Albanians to scale the embassy walls. ""I did it because I knew a massive exodus would make the regime collapse,"" said Werner Daum, the senior West German diplomat in Albania at the time, who turned on the embassy lights and opened the gate. Albanian Politburo members and intelligence agents from that time later said they had gathered information about foreign support for subversive plots to topple the government, pointing the finger at Germany, Italy, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece.""This looked like something spontaneous,"" the communist president at the time, Ramiz Alia, told me. ""But for sure there were hands behind it.""By July 7, the West German compound housed 3,199 people, who slept in the garden and relieved themselves in a hand-dug latrine. A woman gave birth to a baby girl she named Germana. Eight hundred and seventy people slept in the Italian embassy, and about five hundred stayed with the French.""It was so full but the people were happy,"" Gega recalled 25 years later from her home in Bonn, Germany. ""We watched the soccer World Cup every night and at that time Germany won - it was a party."" Albanians atop a water tank in the West German embassy. © Lothar ParzellerThe Albanian government denied the embassies' requests for food and tents. Either take them out of the country or give them to the police, the government said. Instead, the authorities cut the water supply and spies infiltrated the crowds to learn why people had left.A Scooter and Jeans""The reason was the lack of trust in the rules in force,"" one person told an agent who had slipped into the German embassy, according to an Albanian intelligence report.""The reason is to be dressed like the people of my age abroad (blue jeans or other clothes like this) and to have a scooter,"" another person told a spy. ""I have never thought to have these things without working, but I don't know how to buy a scooter in Albania or the clothes.""For Gega's family, it was the relentless persecution by Enver Hoxha and the party. Her relatives had been imprisoned and sentenced to death. The talented Ervis was forbidden to study music or join the choir.On July 8, a United Nations envoy arrived for talks and the government announced it would allow the asylum-seekers to leave the country. Alia realized that they were not going to return home, even with a promise of immunity. Two days later, the plane of the new Czechoslovak president Václav Havel picked up fifty-one Albanians who were in his country's embassy. ""Long live Havel,"" they yelled upon landing in Prague.Tossing Watches and Money  At 4:00 a.m. on July 12, the authorities herded the remaining people onto buses and drove them in a convoy to the port city of Durres, where ferries waited to take them across the Adriatic to Italy. Villagers lined the road to wave good-bye. The passengers threw their watches and money out the bus windows, as if they wanted to leave it all behind.Trains took the asylum-seekers from Italy to Germany, France and beyond, escorted by the Red Cross. After they left, the end of Communist rule was a matter of time. That December, student protests pushed the Central Committee to legalize pluralism. Two months later, a crowd toppled Hoxha's bronze statue in Tirana's Skanderbeg Square. The Albanian Party of Labor won the first multi-party elections on March 31, 1991 and Alia remained president but he held the post for less than one year.Today Gega is a professor at Johannes Guttenberg University in Mainz, plays for the Bonn Classical Orchestra and performs worldwide. ""I'm an Albanian and Albania is my homeland,"" she said. ""But Germany is my home.""

Obama hosted leaders from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Amirates and Oman to discuss a range of issues including the Iran nuclear deal. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch - Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc153ea240000350076f6de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As we near what may be the endgame of the current negotiations with Iran, I am reminded of the place where President Obama announced the overarching strategy that helped produce this moment: Prague. After stating his readiness to speak to Iran in a Democratic primary debate in 2007, and following that up postelection in 2009 with a series of initial statements directed to the Iranians, the President chose the Czech capital to lay out his vision of dealing with the dangers of nuclear weapons in April 2009. That included emphasizing that Iran would not be permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon on his watch: ""Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words must mean something. The world must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons."" As a result of that 2009 speech, the President's nuclear strategy became known as the Prague Agenda. I had the privilege to travel with President Obama back to Prague in April 2010 to witness the signing of a major accomplishment in another area under the Prague Agenda, namely the New START treaty. By the following year, April 2011, I was in Prague as U.S. Ambassador. That year, and in the each year that followed, we held an annual Prague Agenda conference to assess the steps that had been taken and the challenges that lay ahead. In the years since, there has been steady progress in each of the four main areas the President laid out on that spring day in Prague in 2009. New START was a step forward on his first objective, to reduce the risks posed by existing nuclear weapons. Another goal, preventing nuclear terror by safeguarding materials and improving safety, has since been the subject of a series of successful Nuclear Security Summits in Washington, Seoul and the Hague. I saw first-hand the President's personal commitment to a third objective articulated in Prague: to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. I was, for example, present in the Oval Office in October 2011 when the President and the Czech Prime Minister met. President Obama advocated for the use of civil nuclear power as a part of the Czech energy mix (and also to achieve energy independence from Russia). That approach has been replicated in administration policy supporting civil nuclear energy in the United States and around the world.Now, with the possible Iran deal, progress under the Prague Agenda's final prong is in reach: holding to account a state which had violated its nuclear obligations under international treaties. I am not of the school that believes the President needs to secure an Iran deal to build his legacy. That was never the case. Having known him for almost a quarter of a century, since we were law students together, and having worked for him for six years, first in the White House and then as ambassador, I can attest that those kinds of considerations do not enter into critical decisions like this one. Even the President's strongest critics have to admit that legacy is, as a matter of logic, much less of a consideration after the recent breakthroughs on the Affordable Care Act and on Trade Promotion Authority. Instead, as the comprehensive nature of the Prague Agenda itself suggests, President Obama is pursuing a deal out of principle. He is acting from his conviction that a good agreement with Iran represents another step toward making the U.S., our allies, and the world safe from nuclear terror. It is that ambition that has driven the President's formulation and consistent pursuit of each of the four elements of the Prague Agenda, the obscure aspects just as much as the headline-making ones. Of course, as the President himself has repeatedly emphasized, the deal must be a good one. That is why I recently joined a bipartisan group of experts convened by the Washington Institute for Near East Peace in signing a statement laying out criteria for what any deal with Iran must at a minimum contain in five core areas: monitoring and verification; possible military dimensions; advanced centrifuges; sanctions relief; and consequences of violations. We also agreed on the importance of complementing any agreement with a strong deterrence policy and a comprehensive regional strategy. I have been encouraged by the warm reception for our statement from all corners, and by the strong tone struck by the American negotiators in Vienna this week. They recognize that willingness to walk away is the surest path to securing a good deal. If such a deal can be struck that meets the criteria in our bipartisan statement, that will be another stride forward under the Prague Agenda -- perhaps the biggest yet. --Norman L.

It marked Ford's first public appearance since the actor was injured when his plane crash-landed in March. Fisher and Hamill had previously reunited at the ""Star Wars"" Celebration event earlier this year alongside former co-stars Peter Mayhew and Anthony Daniels, but it was truly a treat to see Luke and Leia with Han Solo.And for the record, Ford says he's feeling ""fine"":Although ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" director J.J. Abrams said the new trailer won't debut until the fall, a behind-the-scenes reel was shown during the panel. The video featured a look at ""The Force Awakens"" cast on set, including Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Lupita Nyong'o.A few key details about the upcoming film also were revealed on Friday. Adam Driver, Domhall Gleeson and Gwendoline Christie all came out as members of the Dark Side during the panel. While we knew Driver will play a bad guy named Kylo Ren and Christie will play Captain Phasma, we learned that Gleeson is also an evil character. The ""Ex Machina"" star will play General Hux, who's in command of Starkiller base, a new location that's an homage to Luke Skywalker's original last name in the ""Star Wars"" scripts. It was also confirmed that Simon Pegg will indeed be in ""The Force Awakens."" However, we won't see his face, since his character will be hidden in a costume. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is out on Dec. 18."

Fuchs said Jett was present during the assault. “Anyone who truly knows me understands that if I was aware of a friend or bandmate being violated, I would not stand by while it happened.” Jett, who still performs with the Blackhearts, wrote on Facebook. “For a group of young teenagers thrust into '70s rock stardom there were relationships that were bizarre, but I was not aware of this incident. Obviously Jackie’s story is extremely upsetting and although we haven’t spoken in decades, I wish her peace and healing.”Fuchs, who played bass for the Runaways from 1975 to 1977 under the name of Jackie Fox, revealed to HuffPost’s Jason Cherkis that she was drugged at a New Year’s Eve party during her time with the band, and was raped by band manager and music industry heavyweight Kim Fowley. The claim was corroborated by several witnesses, including former Runaway lyricist Kari Krome. Fuchs had never spoken publicly about the attack before HuffPost’s report, published on Wednesday.Fuchs said the rape took place in a California hotel room in the presence of bandmates Jett and Cherie Currie, along with numerous other partygoers. Fuchs said she had been given a Quaalude and was brutally violated by Fowley as she slipped in and out of consciousness.“I can’t move. I can’t speak. All I can do is look him in the eye and do the best I can do to communicate: Please say no,” Fuchs recounted. “I don’t know what it looked like from the outside. But I know what was going on inside and it was horror.” She last remembered looking up to see Jett and Currie staring at her.Brent Williams, who was also present in the hotel room, told HuffPost that he was asked by Jett to deny witnessing anything if contacted by lawyers.Jett had denied “witnessing the event as it has been described here,” when presented with HuffPost’s reporting prior to the article's publication. Her representative referred further questions to Fuchs, “as it’s a matter involving her and she can speak for herself.”Fowley, who died in January, had been accused of assault by numerous women, some in their teens at the time. He was openly attracted to teenagers and vulnerable females: “I’m like a shark. I’ll smell the blood,” he said of himself. Former Runaway singer Cherie Currie described him as “a beast [who] should not be allowed near young girls.”“It was the abuse from Kim Fowley and our roadies that was so hard to take. We got such abuse on a daily basis,” Currie told the Guardian in 2010. In her memoir, Currie wrote of Fowley having sex with a woman in front of the band.Krome, a former Runaway who claimed to have witnessed the rape of Fuchs, revealed to HuffPost that Fowley assaulted her at his apartment, and a fan backstage at a 1975 show.Fowley denied ever sexually assaulting any of the Runaways. “They can talk about it until the cows come home but, in my mind, I didn’t make love to anybody in the Runaways nor did they make love to me,” he said in a 2013 biography of the band, according to Yahoo News. He was never charged in any of the alleged assaults.Fuchs said she was inspired to break 40 years of silence after seeing other high-profile sexual assaults made public, such as claims against Bill Cosby.Kathy Valentine, formerly of the groundbreaking all-female band the Go-Go's, expressed support for Fuchs. ""Jackie is incredibly brave for finally speaking out about this. I told her, and I will say it here too: she has done FAR more for women by speaking out than the Runaways ever did,"" Valentine wrote on Facebook. Valentine said she understood why witnesses remained quiet immediately after the assault, writing, ""They were glad it wasn't them. He was their ticket to being rock stars, touring, recording -- living their dream. They thought this was part of rock and roll, that she got this messed up, too bad for her.""Read the full HuffPost report on Fuchs’ story here. Also on HuffPost:"

(Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a0707f170000dd073266e7.jpeg?ops=crop_43_65_2833_2018%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) If Serena Williams wins Wimbledon Saturday (July 11), she will likely say — as she usually does after a big win — “I want to thank Jehovah God.”Williams, 33, is the No. 1-ranked women’s tennis player in the world, known for her relentless will, bullying strokes and withering speed. She is also a Jehovah’s Witness, a faith that encourages members to separate from the broader world and discourages them from competitive sports on the grounds that it promotes nationalism, violence and celebrity — all things Witnesses are supposed to avoid.And yet for Williams, her faith is like a secret weapon, a stealthy supply of strength and perseverance that some observers say is as vital to her game as her 120 mph serve. A Saturday win would bring her one step closer to a “calendar slam” — the rarely achieved four Grand Slam tournament wins in one year.How has Williams balanced her faith and the winner’s circle? It is a subject she and her sister Venus, also a tennis star and former No. 1 player, have discussed only rarely. But Serena Williams has left a trail of comments that show her belief in God, and especially her identity as a Witness, has bolstered her already formidable tennis talents.“I have to thank Jehovah God for this,” Serena Williams told the crowd after receiving the trophy at the Australian Open in January, her sixth win there. “I was down and out and he helped me today and I just said prayers, not to win but to be strong and to be healthy and in the end I was able to come through so I have to give the glory to him first and foremost.”She and her four older sisters became Witnesses after their mother, Oracene, converted to the faith in the early 1980s. Serena Williams has said she attends church and has gone door-to-door, as Witnesses are required to do, to hand out tracts and evangelize.In 2012, her older half-sister Isha Price told the writer John Jeremiah Sullivan, who had a rare sit-down interview with Serena that explored her faith, that the tennis stars’ fame sometimes gives them access that other Witnesses might not get.“And they saw that as a blessing — getting to talk to people who would not ordinarily let them in,” Sullivan told The New York Times after the interview. “But there were other houses, she said, where people didn’t know who they were and were just as hostile or unreceptive as to anyone else.”Sullivan added that their family also told him the famous sisters “have witnessed to some of the players. According to Oracene, at least a few people have been curious, if not receptive.”If Serena Williams’ celebrity has been a blessing, it has also been a curse — at least in the eyes of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. At the 2009 U.S. Open, she allegedly threatened a line judge after a ruling went against her and was disqualified. What she actually said has been disputed, but the judge held that her life had been threatened. That brought local church elders to Serena Williams for what Sullivan described as a “dressing down.”“What bothered me most was that I was representing my religion,” she said about the incident. “I just felt like anyone who knew I was a Witness was stumbled. And I really don’t want to stumble anybody . . . They had to have a talk with me.”A national church representative declined to comment for this story. Other famous Jehovah’s Witnesses include Prince, and the late singers Michael jackson and Selena.But there have been other times Serena Williams’ faith has bolstered her off the court. In 2003, Yetunde Price, her oldest half-sister, was killed in a shooting. Serena Williams was the first one to get the news. Her tennis suffered. She took time off, reportedly attending Witness meetings and Bible studies up to three times a week.“I tried to develop a better relationship with God,” she told The New York Times in 2007 about this time. “You have a strong solid foundation, the Bible says, you won’t crack, but the man who built his house in the sand, his house went down spiritually. I have a really strong foundation. That’s how I was raised.”That foundation has seemingly served her well through many more ups and downs — career-threatening injuries, a hematoma and embolism surgery, scandals involving her skin-showing tennis attire and nude magazine portraits. (Witnesses are expected to dress modestly.) She has lost the No. 1 ranking several times — once dropping to 175 — and many sports commentators wrote her off by early 2012.Then she started winning again: Wimbledon, then the Olympics in singles and doubles (with sister Venus) in 2012, then the French and U.S. Opens in 2013, and the U.S. Open in 2014. This year, she has won two Grand Slams, and if she wins Wimbledon, she’ll have a so-called “Serena Slam” — four major wins in a row. If she adds the U.S. Open in September, she have the history-making “calendar slam.”Writing of her comeback in mid-2012, Sullivan credited faith as a factor.“It’s impossible not to feel that this fierce closeness of the Williams women,” he said of Venus, Serena and their mother, Oracene. “Strengthened by their shared faith, with its emphasis on separation from the world — has had not a little to do with the tremendous psychological stability Venus and Serena have demonstrated over the nearly 17 years of their careers,” he wrote.Serena-watchers today agree. Joseph Price, a professor of religious studies at Whittier College who has written about religion and sports, said Williams’ displays of faith are in line with Jehovah’s Witnesses guidelines — she does not give personal testimony — the way an evangelical Christian athlete like footballer Tim Tebow does — but speaks about the power of God and the Bible.“Because she rarely reveals anything personal in post-game interviews, she deflects attention away from anything other than the game,” Price said. “My hunch is she tries to minimize the possibility of becoming an object of idolatrous fascination.”Lee DelleMonache, director of the Neumann University Institute for Sport, Spirituality and Character Development, said Serena Williams’ balance of the spiritual and the human separates her from other athletes.“I know that when she stumbles or she gets criticized or she curses on the court, she has called herself on that,” DelleMonache said. “I love that she takes responsibility for that and stays true to her faith.”In a 2002 interview with ASAP Sports, she put it like this: “I am Jehovah’s Witness. If you don’t believe in God — I think if you don’t believe in God, it’s going to be tough to live life because pretty much that’s the basis of life, it comes from God. And so being a Jehovah’s Witness, obviously we believe in God and the Bible. And without Him, I wouldn’t be here right now. I really thank Him for everything.”"

Not many! I've got two daughters-in-law who are precious to me and one more soon to be welcomed joyously into our family. I find myself always trying to be a well intentioned, non-meddling mother-in-law. Sometimes, I even succeed. Sometimes I don't. So, in a quest to be loving, gracious and wise in my dealings with my sons' wives, I did some digging, probing and surveying. I asked daughters-in-law of all ages - newly married to married for decades - what would they like their mothers-in-law to know in order to maximize healthy relationships between them. Below are my findings:COMMUNICATE: Tabitha advises that when a daughter-in-law asks a mother-in-law to do something, all parties should be clear on the parameters. For instance, Tabitha continues, ""If I am asking my mother-in-law to help me out the first week I am home from the hospital with a new baby, before she commits or re-negs, we both should have a clear understanding about what I am asking. To stay in our home or a hotel? To clean the house? To cook? To do feedings? To watch the other children? Make sure you both know what's being asked, what's expected and what is agreed upon."" BABY-SIT: Bella told me that as a daughter-in-law, she would have appreciated more babysitting on a regular basis from her mother-in law. She says, ""Although my mother-in-law was a kind, loving lady, she was clear that this was my responsibility - to be with my own kids - she already had had her 'turn'. My husband and I were desperate to have a little time to ourselves - we really needed it. What I learned: I make myself available now to my son and daughter-in- law! And if I had it to do all over again, I would have been more forthcoming with my mother-in-law about our need as a couple for a little alone time away from the kids to recharge our batteries.""  EMBRACE DIFFERENCES: Rina says, ""I would like my mother-in-law to honor me for who I am and the family from which I came - which includes our religion, approach to life, celebration of holidays and methods of communication - even if they clash with hers. I had a sorority sister who was Jewish, married to a Presbyterian. Every year, her mother-in-law gave her a piece of Judaica for a holiday gift. I thought that was such a heart-warming gesture. And so did she!""  RESPECT MY MOTHER: Sarah talks about the importance of her mother-in-law realizing that she has a mother who is very sensitive to the fact that she needs to share her daughter with another woman now. ""When my mother-in-law invites me to do girlfriend activities, like shopping and having lunch, it's easy for me to feel torn. On the one hand, it gives us a forum for friendship beyond our mother-in-law/daughter-in-law relationship, but I also have to be mindful of my own mother's needs and feelings. I would ask my mother-in-law to be sensitive about this and to have a little patience, especially in the beginning, so that things can be allowed to evolve naturally.""   INCLUDE, SHARE, COMPLIMENT: Jill said she started to get along much better with her mother-in-law when her mother-in-law started doing three things: including her in family discussions, inviting Jill to share with her if things were starting to go amiss and complimenting Jill on the way she does things: like makeup, child care, cooking and treating her son with love and respect.  ZIP YOUR LIPS SHUT: Samantha said the best advice she can give to mothers-in-law is to pick your battles, especially in the beginning. ""Do your best to bite your tongue and not interfere unless there's a super important issue. That way, you and your daughter-in-law stand the best chance of starting off on the right foot. For example, if in your own home, you always make French Toast from scratch, but your sons's wife serves him frozen French toast, let it go. There are more important issues to tackle.""   PROVIDE A SAFE HAVEN: Helen says, ""I would like mothers-in-law to understand that if there is tension between us, your son is going to feel very pulled and anxious. Therefore we need to work together from this shared mindset so the man we both love is not caught in the middle of our squabbles. The best gift a mother-in-law can bestow is providing a comfortable, stress free environment when the family gets together.""  CURB YOUR SELF-ABSORPTION: Connie got right to the point. ""My mother-in-law over personalizes and tends to see things only from her vantage point. I would like to advise her not to over scrutinize, to lighten up, laugh more and look less diligently to find fault. And I am going to try to share a little more with her so she has a frame of reference for our actions and behaviors.""  TREAD LIGHTLY:  All of the above women - no matter their age - concurred that newlyweds don't want urgings from their mothers-in-law to hurry up and get pregnant. Tina summed it up succinctly. ""We are not baby making machines. And we were not placed on this earth to fulfill your desire for grandchildren.""NO LITMUS TEST: And from Gail: ""The biggest No-No? Talking about your son's old girlfriends and/or ex-wives. Please don't.""THINK ABOUT THIS: Geri summed it up: ""The son you raised chose to marry me. How bad can I be?""Previously published in www.americanisraelite.com/archives/category/incidentally-iris Follow Iris on her Facebook page www.chicktalk4boomers.com and her website www.irisruthpastor.com Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Jackie and I are vacationing in London at the moment and had planned side trips to Oxford to see friends and to Lewes to attend a couple of opera performances at the Glyndebourne Festival. Our travel days coincided with not one but two prospective industrial actions, and, as usual, it was difficult to get reliable and useful updates from news media -- or indeed from railroad employees, at least one of whom was a positive volcano of misinformation.Strikes were likely both on the London Underground (which would be completely shut down for a day and a half) and on several rail lines (which might or might not suffer cancellations and delays). We needed to know whether we'd be able to get a train from Oxford to London or whether we'd have to take the bus in heavy traffic; how we'd get back to our lodgings once we'd arrived in London; and whether the following morning we'd get to Lewes at all without hitchhiking in our opera duds.What I did was follow the Twitter feeds of all relevant companies: @nationalrailenq for general train information; @TfLTravelAlerts for London Underground updates; and the two train operators whose routes we were hoping to travel on -- @FGW and @SouthernRailUK. All of these were tweeting like mad, with a helpful flow of news about the effects of the strikes, interlaced with day-to-day travel alerts, such as ""Trains between Guildford and Havant are being delayed by up to 20 minutes due to signalling problems"" and ""Trains are expected to be able to call at Battersea Park from the start of service tomorrow following electrical supply problems."" Great for train-spotters as well as anxious travelers. At one point, I was still uncertain about our evening train from Oxford to London; I tweeted directly to @FGW and in a matter of minutes had received a specific (and accurate) answer to my question: they must have a very busy social media desk.In the end everything worked out, even though we had to walk to Victoria Station during the Underground strike -- which we did in beautiful weather. (It wouldn't have been fun if we'd been carrying much more than a laptop, a toothbrush and a change of socks.) But having good and very timely information took much of the stress out of what could have been a nerve-racking few days.Would this work as well in other European countries? A spot check of train operators' feeds suggests that some but not all pay the same attention to Twitter or as proactive as companies in Britain. Some respond to passenger queries, some just dish out advertising; some are next to useless.

Yemeni government officials were not immediately available to comment.Air raids pounded Houthi and Yemeni army units in the capital Sanaa and in the embattled southern cities of Taiz and Aden, where residents also reported intense artillery exchanges between the fighters and local militiamen.In Aden, one of the country's most deprived and war-torn areas, witnesses said Houthi forces fired mortars and Katyusha rockets toward opposition fighters based in northern areas and around the city's international airport.A 15-year old boy was killed in Houthi shelling on a civilian house in the southern city of Dhalea hours after the truce, residents said.Bombing by the Arab alliance and fighting have killed more than 3,000 people since March 26. DRONE STRIKEThe Houthis, who hail from the Shi'ite Muslim sect, and their army allies say their spread throughout the country is part of a revolution against a corrupt government and hardline Sunni Muslim militants which they say are allied to the opposition forces, and they vowed to keep up the fight despite the truce.""Our security and armed forces maintain their right to fight and hunt down al Qaeda and Islamic State elements as part of our just defense of our people,"" Colonel Sharaf Luqman, spokesperson for the Houthi-allied army, said in a statement on Saturday.All parties in Yemen's conflict had welcomed the announcement of the truce and called for it to be extended.But the exiled government wants the Houthis to release prisoners and give up land they have seized in battle, while the Houthis say they doubt any calm will last.Residents in the eastern city of Mukalla said a suspected U.S. drone fired two missiles at cars carrying al Qaeda militants on Friday night, killing three including a senior leader in the group, Abu Hajar al-Hadrami.Washington fears turmoil in Yemen will strengthen al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the deadliest branch of the global militant group.AQAP's new leader Qassim al-Raymi, appointed after his predecessor was killed in a U.S. drone strike last month, called for attacks on the United States in a taped speech released on Thursday.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief elected mostly on promises he would deliver stability, has said militancy poses an existential threat to Egypt, other Arab states and the West.One of the toughest security crackdowns in Egypt's history has weakened the mainstream Muslim Brotherhood group, blamed by security officials for small-scale bombings.The Brotherhood, removed from power by the army in 2013, says it is a peaceful movement.Meanwhile Islamic State's Egyptian affiliate, based in the Sinai, remains resilient despite steady pressure from military fighter planes, Apache helicopters and ground troops.Recently renamed Sinai Province, it has been escalating bombing and shooting attacks on soldiers and police since the military deposed President Mohamed Mursi of the Brotherhood in 2013 after mass protests against his rule. Hundreds have died.The attack at the Italian consulate raises the stakes in the struggle between militants and the government, which has just started rebuilding an economy battered by four years of turmoil since an uprising toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011.It also highlighted Islamic State's reach after it seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria, expanded into Egypt's neighbor Libya and more recently claimed responsibility for high-profile attacks in France, Kuwait and Tunisia. TURMOILEgypt has witnessed an increase in attacks against tourism targets recently, including a suicide bombing near the ancient Karnak temple in Luxor last month.Egypt has been relatively stable in a region engulfed by militancy and sectarian conflict since the Arab Spring uprisings toppled dictators who had largely kept militants under check through widespread repression.Militant violence and political turmoil triggered by the 2011 revolt that ousted Mubarak have hurt Egypt's tourism industry, a traditional pillar of the economy.Two weeks ago, a car bomb killed the country's top public prosecutor and militants affiliated to Islamic State attacked several military checkpoints in North Sinai, in what was the fiercest fighting in the region in years.The army said 17 soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed in those clashes.Western countries are hoping ally Sisi can maintain relative stability in the Arab world's most populous country.Egypt is also worried about spillover from militants who have been thriving in the chaos of neighboring Libya, where Sisi has already ordered air strikes on Islamic State targets.

It was the best yet! Congratulations Kitty Boone and Walter Isaacson and to their wonderful staff. The format is always fascinating. The Organization of the event was based on Smart Solutions for the World's Toughest Challenges, such as the Endangered American Dream, Planet on the Brink, Challenges to Democracy, Making Art Work, The Global Marketplace, Violence in America, The Beauty of Mathematics, Oceans '15, The Mind, Will Technology Save Us?, Faith, Conflict and the Future of Religion.On Saturday I attended a session on mortality from the Spotlight on Health segment. One of the guests was Dan Diaz whose wife, Brittany Maynard, was diagnosed with a brain tumor at age 29. They moved from Colorado to Oregon in order for her to avoid the suffering that they knew was in store for her. He explained their experience through his tears. It certainly gave me hope for the legislation now pending in our California State legislature. Dan is working with many legislatures in the hopes of achieving a similar Oregon law, Death with Dignity Act, in other states.Sunday marked the end of the Spotlight Health, and I listened to Dr. Garth Graham, the President of the Aetna Foundation as well as a practicing doctor and medical professor. He told us the astounding news that your zip code was a greater predictor of your life expectancy than your genetic code. In Boston itself one zip code the life expectancy is 58 years of age and just a short distance away a different zip code gives you a life expectancy to age 90. The discussion revolved around the tremendous health inequity in America. Also in the same session we were introduced to Dr. Vivek Murthy who is our current surgeon general. He is working on programs to promote health equity, as well as to develop a culture of prevention in the United States. I was shocked to learn that there are 42 million people diagnosed as mentally ill in the United States.During the spotlight on health session there were three films which aired prior to my arrival in Aspen. An 80-minute edited version of the Ken Burn's documentary on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, The Emperor of all Maladies which deals with cancer. The second film was How to Dance in Ohio, this film tells the story of high school students on the autistic spectrum preparing to go to the prom and what the preparation entails and how meaningful the experience can be. The third film was the Armor of Light which is a documentary about a conservative Reverend Robert Schenck who has fought the Right Wing movement over the gun issue and as he feels that a pro-life position demands an anti-gun policy. Later in the week I saw the shocking and riveting documentary, The Hunting Ground, which chronicles the epidemic of college campus sexual assaults that are not properly handled by the college administrators. Seventy colleges were mentioned and are under investigation as a result of the efforts of the women in the film.The opening session of the actual festival on Sunday evening gave us a rundown on what was to come. We were welcomed by Walter Isaacson who heads the Aspen Institute and who spoke to us about the importance of curiosity and quoted Albert Einstein who said ""I have no particular talents. I am only passionately curious."" David Bradley, the publisher of the Atlantic monthly, who is one of the sponsors of the Conference typically opened the festival with a fabulous presentation and a wonderful sense of humor. He discussed romance and gave the amazing statistics that just under 50 percent of first American marriages end in divorce, 60 percent of second marriages and a whopping 80 percent of third marriages end in divorce in the United States, so I guess it pays to hang in the first time around.I listened to Senator Mark Warren (VA) and Tom Fanning, President of Southern Utility, who were very optimistic about the United States' ability to increase sustainable growth. Both of them spoke so passionately giving examples of their personal success. General David Petraeus and Ben Rhodes of the Obama Administration both discussed the Iran deal and agreed it was critically important to world security.Some of the high points of the week for me was Michael Eisner's (former Disney President and Chairman) interview of Cameron Carpenter. One of the world's most famous and talented Organist, Cameron not only composes music but is building a digital Organ and started playing at age 4. He performed and communicated his love of the Organ to the entire audience. Pictured here:Also 2 sessions involving the Marriage Equality Act, as well as Citizens United were presented by two of the United States most famous lawyers who opposed one another in the Citizen's case and joined forces on the Marriage Equality Case. Their explanations and understanding of the law is so brilliant that I was mesmerized. Pictured here is a moment of humor while they are being interviewed by the Chief Editor of the ""Atlantic Monthly"".In a session on Violence in America, I was shocked to learn that since 1980, 620,000 people have been murdered in the United States. That is more than all of the wars in the 20th Century. It is clear that change is absolutely needed! A wonderful solution was offered by influential California lawyer Connie Rice. She was able to convince LAPD Police Chief, Charlie Beck, to assign 50 of his top officers to the public housing projects in Watts in order to secure the safety and security of the residents. Miracles have occurred there as a result of this special program with very well trained officers.One of my favorite sessions was Arianna Huffington's brilliant interview of Tony Marx who heads the New York Public Library system ""Why Libraries Are the Original and Future Open Source Platform"". The New York Public Library system has 40 million visits. It is far and away the largest system in America. Their system of eBooks as well as the lending library of physical books is unsurpassed. It is one of the only completely free institutions in our society and provides access to the internet to a large segment of our community who would otherwise be left out. Tony mentioned an exciting new project at the library. They are examining all the items in their vault and bringing them out for public display. Two very exciting choices- one is the first letter which Christopher Columbus wrote to King Ferdinand when he told him he thought he had discovered something and Thomas Jefferson's note of the Constitution where slavery was crossed out in his draft. These are documents I can't wait to see!When it comes to our climate I learned that all the ocean's algae will disappear by the year 2100 and algae produces a large percentage of the oxygen we breathe. What an amazing week I've had and all surrounded by the incredible natural beauty of Aspen while meeting old and new friends. I can't rave enough about this outstanding Conference! Don't miss it next year!"
