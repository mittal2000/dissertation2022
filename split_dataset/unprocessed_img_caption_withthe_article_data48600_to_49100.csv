0,POLITICS,These Senators Somehow Trust Donald Trump With The Nuclear Codes,Paige Lavender,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ron-johnson-nuclear-codes_us_57b4bd5fe4b0fd5a2f40edb5,There aren't that many of them.,2016-08-17,Johnson is one of the few who would trust Trump with the nuclear codes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b4be3b1800002100bcb6c4.jpeg?ops=crop_0_281_4608_2291%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said he would trust Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with the nuclear codes.After he was asked about the codes on the campaign trail, Johnson at first responded that he has “a greater agreement with Mr. Trump” than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on certain issues, according to Wisconsin Public Radio. Johnson was again asked whether he trusted Trump with the codes, to which he replied, “Certainly.”“Take a look at his vice president pick (Mike Pence), take a look at his Supreme Court justices, take a look at his family,” Johnson said.Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), through a spokesman, also said Wednesday he would trust Trump with the codes. “Rob believes that Mr. Trump and the national security team he appoints will protect our security interests and do everything they can to keep America safe, and that includes the president’s nuclear responsibilities,” Portman campaign spokesman Michawn Rich told the Toledo Blade.Both Johnson and Portman are currently engaged in tough re-election fights. Portman has endorsed Trump while criticizing some of his more extreme rhetoric, while Johnson has said he will vote for Trump without offering an official endorsement.“To me, ‘endorsement’ is a big embrace. It basically shows that I pretty well agree with an individual on almost everything. That’s not necessarily going to be the case with our nominee,” Johnson told CNN in June.Several lawmakers have expressed concerns about Trump having access to the codes, including Vice President Joe Biden and Clinton.“Imagine, if you dare, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis,” Clinton said during her speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.GOP Sens. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and John McCain (Ariz.) have avoided questions about Trump and the nuclear codes.A letter sent by 50 Republican national security officials earlier this month said Trump “would be the most reckless President in American history.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
1,RELIGION,Dozens Of Evangelical Leaders Petition Texas To Stop Scheduled Execution,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dozens-of-evangelical-leaders-petition-texas-to-stop-scheduled-execution_us_57b4af0ce4b095b2f5420c4a,"Evangelicals are increasingly seeing the death penalty as a ""pro-life"" issue.",2016-08-17,"Texas death row inmate Jeffery Wood is scheduled to be executed August 24, 2016 for a murder he did not commit.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b4b3fd170000ae02c73d0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of nearly 50 evangelical leaders are urging the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Governor Greg Abbott to halt the upcoming execution of death row inmate Jeffery Wood.In a letter signed by 49 evangelicals from Texas and around the country, the Christian leaders said officials have a “moral obligation” to stop the execution, which is scheduled for Aug. 24.Evangelicals have historically been divided on the death penalty. The National Association of Evangelicals has stood in favor of the death penalty since the 1970s, though it updated its stance in 2015 to acknowledge that the Christian ethic could also undergird opposition to capital punishment.“Many of us in the evangelical Protestant community are coming to where the Catholics have been for a while: pro-life in terms of whole life, all vulnerable life, whether in the womb or on death row,” one of the letters signatories, Joel Hunter, told The Marshall Project, a news outlet focused on criminal justice.Among the letters signatories are ten Texas pastors and 39 other national leaders, including Jim Wallis, Lisa Sharon Harper, David Gushee, Tony Campolo and Shane Claiborne. “Our faith compels us to speak out in this case, where a looming execution date threatens the life of an individual with significant mental impairments who never should have been sentenced to death,” the letter, dated Aug. 8, states.Wood was sentenced to death in 1998 for aiding in the murder of Kris Keeran, a gas station attendant who was killed during a robbery in 1996. Wood’s former roommate, Danny Reneau, committed the murder while Wood waited for him in a car outside. Reneau was convicted and executed in 2002.Wood was previously scheduled to be executed in 2008, but a San Antonio judge postponed the execution so officials could determine whether he was mentally fit.Wood’s family describes him as an “eight-year-old in a man’s body” with “debilitating emotional and intellectual impairments” that made him vulnerable to manipulation, according to The Washington Post. His case is unusual ― people who have never killed or intended to kill are rarely sentenced to death. But his conviction falls under Texas’s “law of parties,” which states that a person who “solicits, encourages, directs, aids, or attempts to aid the other person to commit an offense” is criminally liable for that offense.“As the getaway driver, Wood committed a crime, but not one deserving the death penalty,” wrote the evangelical leaders.“It deeply troubles us when the criminal justice system concludes that some of the most vulnerable in society can be executed and disposed of,” the letter stated. “All are made in God’s image, and as a society we especially must protect those with mental illness and disabilities.”"
2,ENTERTAINMENT,Peppy Electric Violinist Lindsey Stirling Continues To Defy Your Ridiculous Music Categories,Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-stirling-violin-brave-enough_us_57b3575ce4b0863b02851e8c,The genre-defying artist tackles heartbreak and loss in her new album.,2016-08-17,Lindsey Stirling performs at New York City's Panorama Music Festival on July 22.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b37a4f170000ae02c73980.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In her most popular YouTube music video, boasting 154 million views, Lindsey Stirling tiptoes around an icy landscape with her violin. She would strike a severe figure in her hooded outfit if the camera never caught her face ― bright and friendly despite the theatrically foreboding tone of her song, “Crystallize,” an instrumental dubstep tune released in 2012. Stirling is an electric violinist known mainly by the animated performances of original material and covers she uploads to YouTube. Her videos demonstrate lithe twirling, a gymnast’s flexibility and total mastery of one age-old stage direction: “smile with your eyes.” Her subscribers, numbering over 8.3 million, leave supportive messages in the comments section (an odd pattern on a platform nearly synonymous with “internet troll”) that she occasionally reads. Her Instagram page is an album of goofy faces, her travels, her friends ― relentless fun. The comments section is similarly filled with exclamation points and all-caps enthusiasm. It may come as a surprise, then, to know her most recent two studio albums were inspired by personal despair. Stirling’s 2014 “Shatter Me” tackles her recovery from anorexia, while her upcoming “Brave Enough” was sparked by the sudden death of her close friend and keyboardist, Jason Gaviati.After her manager pulled her off the couch, Stirling told The Huffington Post that she adopted a dog, Luna, who is seen in some of her Instagram pictures, and got to work shaping up her then-fledgling album. Like countless artists before and, surely, after her, the 29-year-old found that pouring these terrible experiences into writing helped. “I think we live in a world of masking and covering up wounds rather than actually feeling them,” she reflected.“Brave Enough,” she said, follows a theme of “vulnerability,” reflecting her mindset after the loss of her friend. Describing Stirling’s work in terms of something so cohesive as a theme, however, might seem unfitting. Her new album features a range of collaborators across a range of genres including EDM superstar Zedd, rapper Lecrae, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo and former Jack’s Mannequin songwriter Andrew McMahon. Her collection of YouTube videos span “Phantom of the Opera” to dubstep to video game music, making her style a confused mélange of sounds to relax to and dance to.Stirling doesn’t seem to care.“I don’t love categories. I don’t love labels,” she said. “I’ve always thought that when you’re talking about art or people ― labels are for food, you know? I don’t think people or art should have to be put into a box.”It’s perhaps a blessing, then, that the performer dodged the chance to step into the genre-obsessed entertainment industry through “America’s Got Talent,” in which she competed as an unknown in 2010. The reality series offers an intense national spotlight and the chance to headline a Las Vegas show, but cut her in the quarterfinals. (”To be honest, I didn’t perform amazingly that night,” Stirling admitted.) Instead, she took her music elsewhere, and that egalitarian space suits her. Like a human amalgam of a Tumblr feed, she is seemingly equal parts musicianship, unconventional instrumentation, shameless self-expression and a photogenic goofball, appealing to anyone who might relate to one or all of those qualities that have melded together in one red-headed package.“That’s the unusual thing about the internet,” Stirling summarized. “It opens the gateway so more unique art can come out, because everything doesn’t have to go through gatekeepers anymore.” So far, she’s played with Celine Dion, Wiz Khalifa, Charlie Puth and, in 2014, as a guest performer returning to “America’s Got Talent” after finding a different road to success. In her online corner, the violinist has found a place where she can thrive ― connecting her music with an audience that delights in connecting with her.“Brave Enough” is available Aug. 19.The Huffington Post receives a percentage from the purchase of tickets bought via a link on this page."
3,MEDIA,Donald Trump Is The Candidate From Breitbart News,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-breitbart-donald-trump_us_57b49a78e4b0b42c38afc52f,"Steve Bannon temporarily leaves the ""populist, nationalist"" site to run the Republican nominee and loyal reader's campaign.",2016-08-17,"Bloomberg Businesweek dubbed Steve Bannon the ""most dangerous political operative in America.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b4be0e180000ad02bcb6c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― When Donald Trump descended the escalator at Trump Tower on June 16, 2015 and launched into a campaign kickoff speech that included railing against Mexico for supposedly sending drug dealers and “rapists” over the border, Steve Bannon saw a Breitbart News reader at the podium. “That speech really talked about the themes that have been on Breitbart,” Bannon told The Huffington Post last month during the Republican convention in Cleveland. “His thing on illegal alien crime was literally taken off the pages of Breitbart.”Breitbart News, a self-described “populist, nationalist” site, has been viewed as Trump’s biggest media megaphone throughout the 2016 election, amplifying his positions and blasting Republican critics and other media outlets. But as Bannon, the site’s executive chairman, temporarily leaves his position to become the Trump campaign’s chief executive, the perception of who’s been boosting whom gets murky. “So wait, Breitbart is now running the Trump campaign when all this time we thought Trump was running Breitbart,” tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, former Obama White House communications director. Washington Post reporter Bob Costa suggested that was the case Wednesday morning on MSNBC: “The beating heart of Trumpism started at Breitbart.”Trumpism didn’t start, however, with Andrew Breitbart, the late founder and media provocateur. It started when Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs banker, filmmaker and conservative activist, took over the site after its namesake founder died in 2012. Dubbed the “most dangerous political operative in America” last year by Bloomberg Businessweek, Bannon has led a site that’s increasingly taken hard-line positions on immigration and trade while dropping bombs on Republican establishment figures deemed insufficiently conservative ― from former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor to current House Speaker Paul Ryan.The site’s traffic grew to more than 30 million unique readers last month, thanks to its pugilistic style and Trump boosterism ― and much to the dismay of many in Republican media and political circles.“Bannon has ruined the Breitbart News operation by running it as a Trump super-PAC full of sensationalized stories and Trump fan fiction, rather than the sharp, muscular, anti-establishment vision the late Andrew Breitbart had for the enterprise,” Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak wrote Wednesday in The Hill. Conservative radios hosts and Trump critics Charlie Sykes and Erick Erickson also took aim when news of the latest campaign shake-up emerged. Stephen Hayes, a Weekly Standard senior editor and Fox News contributor, declared Wednesday that Trump had chosen to “end his campaign living in the alternate reality that Breitbart creates for him on a daily basis.” Though Bannon has expressed admiration for Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chief and political operative who is reportedly advising Trump ahead of next month’s presidential debates, he’s said Fox is “not nearly as right-wing” as Breitbart.“Fox, in fact, has been a globalist, not particularly nationalist site,” he told HuffPost last month. “And I think the mainstream media misses that Fox is not nearly as right-wing or conservative as Breitbart. And we consider ourselves the litmus test of the populist, nationalist news reporting in the country and we’re very proud of that.”Given Bannon’s proclivities, the Trump campaign under his watch isn’t expected to tone things down or try appealing to moderates ― in other words, do what a convention Republican candidate would normally do to court the broadest swath of general election voters. Instead, it’s more likely a Trump campaign under Bannon will be even less restrained when targeting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, possibly dredging up the decades-old scandal of President Bill Clinton’s infidelity in the White House. He signaled that was the plan in the Bloomberg News profile: “There’s a whole generation of people who love the news but were 7 or 8 years old when this happened and have no earthly idea about the Clinton sex stuff,” he said. That profile said Bannon urged Trump to make a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border early in his campaign and Breitbart News’ laudatory coverage of Trump throughout the election season has fueled rumors that he helps fund the site. Last year, Bannon said there was “no financial relationship with Donald Trump as an investor, advertiser or in any other capacity at this time—nor have we ever.” Former Breitbart News spokesman Kurt Bardella told HuffPost he believes the relationship has been “much more about a transaction of influence and proximity than financial.”In May, Bardella, the president and chief executive of Endeavor Strategies, quit representing Breitbart News after two years because the company wasn’t adequately defending reporter Michelle Fields, who said she was roughly grabbed by then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Fields, who now writes for HuffPost, quit Breitbart News after the incident, as did several staffers who believed the site was siding with the Trump campaign.Ben Shapiro, who quit as Breitbart News editor-at-large around the same time, wrote Wednesday that Bannon betrayed Andrew Breitbart’s mission and turned the site “into Trump Pravda for his personal gain.” Shapiro portrayed Bannon as an opportunist latching onto famous conservatives like Sarah Palin as subjects for a fawning documentary. He said the site “embraced” white supremacy under Bannon’s watch, boosting the so-called alt-right. Shapiro described Bannon as a “vindictive, nasty figure, infamous for verbally abusing supposed friends and threatening enemies.”Bardella, a Republican who does not support Trump, also criticized Bannon’s management style, saying he might call “you up at two in the morning and berate you in a profanity-laced tirade.”“Having someone as volatile as Bannon being the key adviser to someone who is as volatile and unpredictable as Trump, that is not a recipe for success in campaigning and politics,” Bardella added. “Traditionally, you try to have advisers who don’t try to one-up you on hyperbole. It’s going from bad to worse.”Bardella also said Bannon had been “absolutely angling for a position of influence” with Trump and had “openly boasted about the idea of serving in the White House, potentially as a chief of staff.”Bannon did not respond to a request for comment.However, Breitbart News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow pushed back against Bardella’s claim that Bannon was seeking a job. Marlow said he was one of Bannon’s closest confidants at the site and “never heard him say anything remotely resembling that.” “I think that Steve and Donald Trump are simpatico about a few things,” Marlow said in an interview Wednesday. “I know they’ve known each other for a while and I’m not privy to all their communications in the past ― not by a long shot. I do know they seem to be in agreement really what has been the three-legged stool that has propelled not just Trump but this populist, nationalist movement.Two of those legs, he said, are policy issues: immigration and trade. The third, he said, is cultural: Trump’s attacks on “political correctness” and the media. “I think this is another area where Trump and Steve are of one mind ― that sometimes being aggressive and throwing political correctness to the wind might be the best tactic.”In a statement, Breitbart CEO and President Larry Solov described Bannon as “a huge piece of manpower” and said the company knows “he will perform brilliantly in his new role.” Bannon has booked Trump a few times on his SiriusXM morning radio show and suggested to HuffPost last month that the site didn’t have a problem getting access to the campaign. But Bannon said Breitbart News’ interest wasn’t in stories of campaign machinations like one might find on Politico, but in those about national sovereignty, immigration and free trade polices that are “really just a globalist donor, corporatist, giveaway.” “It’s not that Trump’s late to the party,” Bannon added. “But he kind of came and picked up those themes.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

And when they write books that are fairly recently released, and they say wonderful things about him. And now, all of a sudden, they’re saying these horrible things about him,” Trump said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” in late July. “It’s very sad because he’s a very good person. I’ve always found him to be just a very, very good person. And, by the way, a very, very talented person. Look what he’s done. So I feel very badly.”Trump’s campaign denies that Ailes is advising him ahead of his first debate with Clinton in September. But his embrace of Ailes and his unapologetic misogyny are already sabotaging his chances of wooing female voters in November. He is trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton among women voters by double-digit margins in seven key battleground states, according to a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. And several Republican women told the Atlantic they are so disgusted by Trump and the GOP leaders who are supporting him that they are planning to leave the party altogether after November if it doesn’t disavow the loose-lipped real estate mogul. “I was shocked when I saw the leadership in the party standing by him,” said Susan Alvarez, a self-described “lifelong Republican” in Spokane, Washington. “They helped create Donald Trump by not confronting the racism and paranoia that was infecting the party. By their silence, they validated Trump, and for me that is worth leaving the party over.”Trump cannot win in November without the support of women, who make up 51 percent of the U.S. population. Women decided the presidential election in 2012, when Barack Obama beat Republican candidate Mitt Romney by a historic 12-point gender gap. And Trump has the potential to lose by even bigger numbers among women this year― especially if he takes debate tips from a serial sexual harasser. “His campaign is shaping up to be a reflection of what his presidency would mean: a complete and total disaster for women,” said Marcy Stech, a spokeswoman for the pro-choice women’s PAC EMILY’s List. “Luckily, women can and will be the ones to stop him in November.”Romney’s former campaign manager, Katie Packer, thinks Trump isn’t even trying to appeal to women.“So the GOP candidate is just giving up on the women’s vote altogether,” she tweeted. “Got it.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

6,POLITICS,Voters From Both Parties Expect Donald Trump To Lose In November,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/both-parties-expect-trump-loss_us_57b33954e4b0c75f49d86312,"And when it comes to this question, voters are usually right.",2016-08-16,Donald Trump is losing substantially on a polling question that exhibits a strong predictive capacity of electoral outcomes. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b33a06170000ae02c737de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump in recent polling by an average of 8 points ― and the difference is even more pronounced when you look at one particular metric, one that measures voters’ expectations of the race. When pollsters sample a question regularly, we tend to see slight variations that only convey a more meaningful trend over time. But this summer, as pollsters have asked voters who they expect to win in November, we’ve seen something radically different from the usual incremental shift.Clinton is outperforming Trump drastically on the expectations question. The University of Michigan’s monthly survey of consumers shows that the net share of households that expect Clinton to beat Trump in the general election rose to 39 percentage points in August. That’s up from 27 points in July and 14 points in June. This means that in a three-month span, UMich has measured a 25-point rise in the percentage of people who think Clinton will win in November ― a substantial shift in public opinion over a relatively short time. Other polls show a similarly sharp increase. According to a YouGov/Economist poll, Clinton led by 12 points on the expectations question in mid-July, expanding her lead to 20 points in late July. The most recent YouGov/Economist poll has Clinton up by 25 points on this question, showing a 13-point increase in just two months in people who believe Clinton will win the election. Clinton’s lead extends across party lines. A substantial number of Republicans who are voting for Trump ― 32 percent, according to the YouGov/Economist poll ― nevertheless expect him to fall short of victory.The phenomenon exists even more strongly at the state level. Forty-five percent of Utah voters believe Clinton will win the White House in November, while a little more than 25 percent believe Trump will win, according to a recent Dan Jones & Associates survey. These results are particularly striking, since Utah, which is largely Mormon, has been one of the most reliably red states in the nation. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney locked down the Utah vote by a landslide in 2012, as did Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) during his own presidential bid in 2008. The last time Utah swung blue in a presidential election was in 1964, when Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson ran against Republican Barry Goldwater.Americans’ expectations for who will win have historically been a better predictor of election outcomes than their own reported vote preferences, according to research conducted by David Rothschild and Justin Wolfers. As we wrote last month:Looking back on the last three presidential elections, the expectations question [who do you expect will win?] predicted the overall outcome much more accurately than the intent question [who do you intend to vote for?] in nearly every poll who asked it in months leading up to the election. At this stage in the 2012 election, Obama led Romney by an average of 25 points on the expectations question...[even when] the voter intent question indicated a much closer race ― Romney and Obama were within 1 point of each other. The same pattern holds in both the 2008 and 2004 races.The predictive power of the expectations question lies in its relative objectivity. When voters are asked about their objective expectations for what will happen, rather than just what they personally intend to do, they are required to take into account a variety of external conditions and preferences independent from their own. The expectations question is a powerful predictor of general election outcomes. And it’s one that Trump is critically losing. That’s no guarantee of a Clinton victory, but it’s also far from the only ominous signal for the business magnate. Clinton has overtaken Trump in the overwhelming majority of key swing states, and the race is tightening in historically deep-red states. Meanwhile, Trump is polling abysmally among voters of color and losing among traditionally Republican voting demographics.

Trump’s attempts to reverse his plummeting poll numbers have failed miserably. Last week, for example, Trump looked to pivot with a speech on the economy, but ended up suggesting supporters shoot Clinton. This week appears to be following a similar pattern. On Monday, what was billed as a major foreign policy address was mostly notable for Trump suggesting the U.S. administer an ideological test to immigrants seeking visas. Still, Obama cautioned Clinton supporters against taking victory for granted.“If we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake,” he said. “We are still going to have to fight what has been an unrelenting negative campaign against her that has made a dent in the opinion of people even who are inclined to vote for her.” The fundraiser was hosted by Democratic donors Hank and Carol Goldberg at their home in Chilmark, Massachusetts, where the Obama family is vacationing.

It would have pitted King’s two sons against his surviving daughter, who were at odds over whether to sell the medal.In a joint statement from the siblings, the family credited former U.S. President Jimmy Carter with guiding them to the confidential agreement.The three siblings serve as directors of a corporation formed to manage the estate of King, who had no will when he was assassinated in 1968 at age 39 by a white supremacist in Memphis, Tennessee.Martin Luther King III and Dexter King voted in January 2014 to sell the medal and a Bible their father carried during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Bernice King objected to a sale, calling the heirlooms “sacred” to the family.Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney had ordered the items to be kept in a court-controlled safe deposit box pending the outcome of the lawsuit.The judge on Monday signed an order in which the parties asked for the suit to be dismissed and agreed the keys to the box should be given to Martin Luther King III, who serves as chairman of the estate board.The judge said in court he did not know any further details of the settlement.“While Bernice has always believed that the Peace Prize and Bible should not be sold, I am grateful that she has agreed not to stand in the way of the Estate’s decisions about how to handle the items,” Carter said in a statement.“As in any mediation, compromises were required, and I am glad that the parties resolved the issues in the interest of the greater good and their parents’ legacy,” the former president added.Last month, McBurney ruled that the Bible, which Barack Obama, America’s first black president, used at his second inaugural in 2013, belonged to the estate."

A smaller two-thirds majority of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say they’re enthusiastic about or satisfied with Donald Trump, with 32 percent saying they’re dissatisfied or upset.There’s a wider gap on feelings toward each party’s elected officials. Seventy-two percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, but just 40 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters, say they’re at least satisfied with the politicians in their party who currently hold office. Only 3 percent on the GOP side, compared with 20 percent on the Democrats’ consider themselves enthusiastic.But perhaps the most significant gap is in regard to each party’s future. Seventy-one percent of voters on the Democratic side are at least satisfied, compared with 43 percent on the Republican side. Thirty percent of Democrats, but just 8 percent of Republicans, count themselves as enthusiastic.Past HuffPost/YouGov polls conducted in March and last October showed similar differences between the parties, although Republicans were initially more enthusiastic about their field of candidates.Sixty-three percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners now say their party is mostly united, with just 18 percent viewing it as more divided.

It's one of the five U.S. properties in the Trump Hotel Collection recently added to the federal list.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b38403170000ae02c739a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"All Trump hotels are now on the government’s list of hotels and motels that have been approved as “fire safe” for federal employees.As The Huffington Post reported in July, a number of Trump Hotels properties were not on the approved list ― meaning that if he were president, Donald Trump’s staffers would not be allowed to stay there.Only the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago was on the Hotel-Motel National Master List, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency maintains to ensure that federal employees traveling on government business stay in lodging that meets certain basic requirements, such as having fire alarms and sprinklers. Federal employees can’t be reimbursed for nights they spend at hotels that aren’t on the list, or attend conferences or events there.Trump Hotels spokeswoman Christine Da Silva told HuffPost shortly after the original story ran that “there are many optional programs such as this which our hotels regularly evaluate. While some of our properties do not participate in this particular program, our hotels are extremely vigilant and adhere to required fire and safety codes.”But in the weeks since the story was published, five hotels in the Trump Collection, as well as Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, have been added to the federal list of hotels approved for fire safety.“When you contacted us regarding the list, we reached out to FEMA. The organization was very responsive and easy to work with so our properties were able to quickly be added,” a Trump Hotels spokeswoman told HuffPost Tuesday.The process for being added to the list is indeed relatively easy, and 87 percent of the 53,423 hotels and motels in the U.S. are on it, according to data from FEMA and the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Properties that aren’t on the list are not necessarily unsafe, and local fire departments and a review of public records did not uncover any outstanding fire safety issues at Trump hotels.The Hotel-Motel National Master List was created as part of the 1990 Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act, which passed in response to deadly fires at hotels that lacked basic fire safety measure like effective sprinklers and alarms. One such tragedy was a fire at the Hotel Dupont Plaza in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on New Year’s Eve 1986, which killed 96 people and injured more than 140.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
14,POLITICS,Baltimore School Cops' Abuse Of Kids Is Rooted In City's Racist History,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-school-police_us_57b227f7e4b007c36e4fcb44,Charm City's children are arrested at an astounding rate.,2016-08-16,"White high school students gather in front of Baltimore City Hall in October 1954, demanding that black students be barred from previously all-white schools.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b22b32180000ad02bcae5c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Baltimore police officers violated the Constitution by disproportionately stopping, frisking and arresting black residents, according to a damning report from the U.S. Justice Department released last week.But lost in the resulting criticism of the Baltimore Police Department was another, equally concerning aspect of the report: It revealed that the city “has essentially used the Baltimore School Police as an auxiliary force to BPD.” School police can “exercise full police power anywhere within the jurisdiction of the City of Baltimore,” according to the report. This includes making arrests, aiding Baltimore Police officers in investigations and following up on criminal cases.So if Baltimore city cops are systematically violating the rights of black adults in the city, how are their buddies in the school police force treating black kids?They’re arresting them ― a lot.Putting cops in schools leads to the “criminalization of regular, normal adolescent behavior,” said Jenny Egan, a Baltimore public defender who represents juveniles. “When we put police officers in school who aren’t trained, who don’t know anything about adolescent development, and you tell them this is a crime, they’re going to do what police are trained to do ― arrest people.”The data bear that out: Students in Baltimore City Public Schools make up just 10 percent of Maryland’s K-12 school population, but account for 45 percent of Maryland kids arrested in schools. At least 3,390 juveniles were arrested in Baltimore during fiscal year 2015. Ninety-four percent of them were black and 12.6 percent of them (around 427 kids) were arrested in school, according to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services.Despite all those arrests, Baltimore school cops aren’t catching a ton of hardened criminals: Around three-quarters of the kids arrested in Baltimore schools have their charges dismissed or are found not guilty, according to Egan’s analysis of more than 400 school-based arrests from the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years.Baltimore School Police officers are trained to operate not as social workers or adolescent behavior specialists, but as warriors, a March investigation by Mother Jones found. One piece of their training literature quotes “One Warrior’s Creed” by retired cop Steven R. Watt. “You may defeat me,” it says, “but you will pay a severe price and will be lucky to escape with your life.”That “warrior” attitude can lead to abuse. Last year, Lakisha Pulley, a school officer, pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree assault for hitting a middle-schooler in the head with a baton and pepper-spraying two others while they were restrained. This March, officer Anthony Spence was caught on mobile phone video slapping and kicking a teenager. And this sort of behavior has been happening for years: In 2002, school officer Marlon Lynch shot and killed a 13-year-old who was allegedly smoking marijuana and drinking behind an elementary school.So if Baltimore school cops aren’t actually stopping crime — and are sometimes assaulting or killing kids — why are they in schools in the first place? It’s all about history and segregation. A security division for Baltimore public schools was founded in 1967, the same year that Thomas D’Alesandro III became mayor having run on a school integration platform. The timing wasn’t a coincidence, Egan said.“When they got serious about desegregating schools, it was the exact moment that they created a separate [police force] for Baltimore City schools,” she said. “We took these formal ways of segregation and started … using the criminal justice system and police measures to criminalize, in this case, just the presence of black students in Baltimore City public schools.” Although Baltimore had immediately merged its separate school systems following the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, it didn’t redraw any district lines to mix black and white students. Between 1955 and 1963, the number of black children attending all-black elementary and high schools actually increased by 13,000 and 4,500, respectively. Baltimore schools remain de facto segregated to this day, according to a 2013 report from the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. And nearly 82 percent of students in the public schools are black.Shortly after the school security force was established, the Maryland state legislature passed a law making it illegal to disturb school activities, Egan said. This gave officers the green light to arrest students.“The origins of the school police as well as the origins of laws focused on students and children ― like disturbing school activities and making that a crime ― come out of that very charged racial moment,” she said. In 1984, as the crack cocaine epidemic hit cities, then-school Superintendent Alice G. Pinderhughes redesigned the security division to function as an official police force. Personnel titles were changed and, during the tough-on-crime era of the 1990s, the Maryland General Assembly passed a bill confirming that the division held the same powers as a regular police force. Linda Flood moved from the city’s police department to become the Baltimore School Police chief in 1994. Under her leadership, the force received more training and was equipped with marked police vehicles, professional uniforms and firearms.When the No Child Left Behind Act became federal law in 2002, schools across the country were required to report data on student suspensions and expulsions and to justify those decisions. But they weren’t required to report school-based arrests. This had a very unfortunate side effect on student discipline ― at least in Baltimore.“It created this perverse incentive where you couldn’t suspend a kid because the standards were too high and you had to show reason, but you could arrest them,” Egan said.While suspending kids can push them into the hands of police eventually, arresting them is a direct step into the school-to-prison pipeline.That’s what makes the Justice Department’s analysis of the Baltimore School Police so disturbing. An already flawed school police force is traumatizing kids in an overwhelmingly black school system. If that force is also working in tandem with a broken city police department, more African-American kids will be funneled into the criminal justice system just as their lives are starting."

Pat Buchanan, a regular panelist, said it was the first episode McLaughlin had missed in the show’s 34 years on the air, according to the news site Deadline. McLaughlin taped a voiceover, however, to introduce a discussion segment about trade policy, Deadline reported.“As a former Jesuit priest, teacher, pundit and news host, John touched many lives,” the “McLaughlin Group family” said in a Facebook message announcing his death. “Now he has said bye bye for the last time, to rejoin his beloved dog, Oliver, in heaven.” The message didn’t give a cause of death. “The McLaughlin Group,” which aired Sunday mornings on public television stations across the country, featured a panel discussion of current political and policy topics. McLaughlin would typically introduce an issue, then open it up for discussion among four panelists, who included both liberals and conservatives.The current standing roster of panelists for the talk show was Buchanan, a conservative author and former Republican presidential candidate; Eleanor Clift, a Washington correspondent for the Daily Beast; Clarence Page, a syndicated newspaper columnist; and Tom Rogan, a conservative writer and pundit.McLaughlin, who held a PhD in communications from Columbia University, was a columnist for the conservative magazine National Review, and a speechwriter and aide in the Nixon and Ford administrations before creating “The McLaughlin Group” in 1982. His other forays into television included his solo interview show, “John McLaughlin’s One on One,” which aired on public television from 1984 to 2013.McLaughlin’s sheer longevity on television, as well as his no-holds-barred style and grasp of details of insider Beltway political maneuvering, made his weekly talk show something of an institution in Washington political and media class. He pioneered a brash and contentious form of televised political commentary, and was unafraid to grill panelists with questions, interrupt evasiveness and flatly dismiss conclusions he considered wrong.Watch HuffPost Washington Bureau Chief Ryan Grim’s appearance on “The McLaughlin Group” in 2012.But as media modernized to include more diverse faces and less orthodox formats, McLaughlin’s talk show increasingly came to be viewed as an endearing, if out of touch, throwback to a different era of television commentary.Many millennial media consumers’ only knowledge of McLaughlin came from late-night television comic sendups of his retro style. HBO comedian John Oliver in May assembled a minute-long video mashup of McLaughlin’s curmudgeonly expression and tone when introducing discussion topics.McLaughlin also drew mockery from Stephen Colbert in 2008 for claiming that contrary to popular belief, Barack Obama was not the nation’s first black president. “Warren G. Harding was a negro,” McLaughlin said.McLaughlin may have believed a theory about Harding’s African lineage that has since been disproven by DNA testing.McLaughlin had a reputation for inappropriate behavior toward women colleagues. His office manager, Linda Dean, sued him for $4 million in 1988, The Associated Press reported, accusing him of firing her after she complained about his sexual advances. The suit was settled out of court in 1989.Journalists and other Americans familiar with McLaughlin’s work expressed condolences and fond memories."

If you start pivoting, you’re not being honest with people.” “I’ve gotten here in a landslide and we’ll see what happens,” he added. “I mean, in the end, don’t forget when I lost Wisconsin, it was over for Trump. Except for one problem, I then went on a very good run. But no, I am who I am.”It’s true that, in the wake of his Wisconsin loss to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in early April, Trump dominated a handful of primaries across the Northeast. The turnaround ― and especially the large delegate haul out of his native New York ― paved the way to his nomination.But the general election is a different animal, and Trump’s comments to WKBT reveal the degree to which the candidate remains hung up on running a primary campaign focused on merely winning base GOP voters. His divisive rhetoric and positions have driven young voters, women and minorities into the arms of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.Trump ruminated about losing the election in a surprisingly candid interview last week, telling CNBC his strategy is “either going to work or I’m going to have a very, very nice long vacation.”The real estate mogul’s antics, his lack of campaign infrastructure and his refusal to spend on television advertising has even bewildered some GOP operatives, who have theorized Trump may be engaging in self-sabotage in order to conduct an exit out of the campaign.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Over the weekend, Harley posted a photo of herself on Instagram and was met with some serious hate from one troll who clearly has too much time on his or her hands. “You’re ugly as shit,” the commenter wrote. “And that steaming horse shit of a movie, yoga hosers, should be banned. Fuck your talentless cunt of a father for trying to compare it with the matrix. You’re cancer and I sincerely hope you end up like Lindsay Lohan and dead.”Whoa. What even compels someone to write such hateful things? (Seriously, this person needs a life.)When Kevin saw the comment, he entered protective-dad mode and shut down the hater before providing him with a little life advice. “What it’s like to be my daughter: 17 year old @harleyquinnsmith_ received this message simply for the heinous crime of posting a pic of herself on @instagram,” he wrote. “I have zero clue what the reference to #TheMatrix is all about but, wow — way to unload on a teen girl because YOU have nothing to do in life.”He went on, noting that his daughter thought the comment was funny, telling her dad, “I’d be mad if I had a tiny dick and anonymous voice too.”“But here’s a nickel’s worth of free advice for folks like this Troll: if you hate me (or my kid) this much, the better use of your time is to make YOUR dreams come true, instead of slamming others for doing the same,” Kevin continued. “The best revenge is living insanely well — so if you wanna get back at a 17-year-old girl for the grievous crime of enjoying her life, the best way to do it is to succeed in your OWN existence.”“Attacking teen girls on the Internet is the saddest form of masturbation that exists and requires no discernible skill or talent,” he added. You can read his whole message below: Harley also responded to the troll with a post of her own. “At first I was like alright that hurts, but then I realized who the actual fuck cares???” she wrote. “Why should I let this sad ass troll who clearly either has a stick so far up his ass it’s affecting his moral compass or is compensating for an insanely small dick ruin my day??”Harley decided to take the high road and “laugh it off.”“No matter what, there are always going to be people in your life that are either jealous of you, don’t like you or perhaps are just looking to be negative, but you can’t let them get to you because if you let them upset you then they’re winning,” she added.“Don’t ever let some stranger on the Internet try to bring down your self-confidence because you are wonderful just the way you are!! Kill em with kindness kids,” she concluded. You can read her response in full below:"
18,MEDIA,Univision Buying Gawker Media For $135 Million,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/univision-gawker-sale_us_57b3144ae4b0a8e15025371f,"The Spanish-language broadcaster will add to its stable of digital, millennial-geared properties.",2016-08-16,Gawker chief Nick Denton has sold the company he began 14 years ago.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Spanish-language broadcaster and digital publisher Univision is buying Gawker Media for $135 million, a deal that will end the digital publisher’s 14 year-run as an independent company.“Gawker Media Group has agreed this evening to sell our business and popular brands to Univision, one of America’s largest media companies that is rapidly assembling the leading digital media group for millennial and multicultural audiences,” Gawker chief Nick Denton said in a statement. “I am pleased that our employees are protected and will continue their work under new ownership ― disentangled from the legal campaign against the company. We could not have picked an acquirer more devoted to vibrant journalism.”A U.S. bankruptcy judge will need to sign off on the deal this week for it to be completed. Gawker Media filed for bankruptcy in June after a Florida jury awarded Terry Bollea ― aka wrestler and reality TV star Hulk Hogan ― $140 million in an invasion of privacy lawsuit. Though the decision against Gawker could be overturned, or the payout significantly reduced, Denton was still compelled to sell the company, home to flagship site Gawker.com, as well as Gizmodo, Deadspin, Jezebel, Kotaku, Lifehacker and Jalopnik. Ziff Davis, publisher of PCMag and other tech-focused outlets, made a $90 million “stalking horse” bid in June that set the floor for future bidders. Despite speculation that other media companies may have been in the mix, only Ziff Davis and Univision appear to have made bids for the entire company by Monday’s 5 p.m. deadline. Univision, the nation’s largest Spanish-language network, has been on a buying spree over the past year to increase its presence in the digital space and target a millennial audience. The company bought a controlling stake in the Onion in January and a few months later acquired all of Fusion, a millennial-geared TV channel and website it co-launched with Disney in 2013. These moves follow Univision scooping up African-American news and culture site The Root last year.Ziff Davis had said it would honor Gawker Media’s collective bargaining agreement, but it’s not yet clear if Univision will do so as well.The deal marks the end of Denton’s ownership of Gawker Media. Denton sold a minority stake in the company for the first time in January, but otherwise kept it independent, even as some digital competitors were sold (The Huffington Post, Business Insider) or brought in large-scale investments from traditional media companies (BuzzFeed, Vox and Vice).A former Financial Times reporter and early internet entrepreneur, Denton began his blog empire with Gizmodo in 2002. Gawker.com, launched the following year, quickly gained a reputation for dropping bombs on the stuffy New York media establishment in a personal, snarky tone later imitated throughout the industry. Over the years, Gawker Media sites have broken numerous stories on the government, news media and tech world, and helped to amplify the sexual assault claims against Bill Cosby long ignored by most major media outlets. Gawker, at its best, revealed information in the public interest that journalists might have once swapped privately around bar stools. But the site also pushed the boundaries of responsible journalism and notably took down a heavily criticized 2015 story about a publishing executive allegedly soliciting a prostitute. And Gawker couldn’t persuade jurors that its 2012 decision to publish a short video excerpt of a sex tape featuring Bollea was protected under the First Amendment. Gawker argued that it provided verifiable information in response to Bollea’s public boasts about his sex life and claims he hadn’t been intimate with Heather Clem, wife of friend and shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. Hogan tweeted an apparent reference to his fight with Gawker shortly after news of the Univision deal broke.Another major twist in the case came two months after the jury’s decision. Billionaire Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel was revealed to have secretly funded Bollea’s lawsuit, and others, in an attempt to bankrupt Gawker.Thiel, who targeted the company in retaliation for a 2007 post revealing that he is gay, wrote in a Monday New York Times op-ed that he was proud of his actions. Thiel’s secret legal backing of Bollea, however, has alarmed many journalists and First Amendment advocates concerned that other billionaires could similarly finance other people’s lawsuits in attempts to silence media outlets they don’t like. In the past, Denton has articulated Gawker’s guiding editorial mandate as a willingness to publish a story if it’s true and interesting ― and, importantly, believed to be on solid legal ground. “We have this catchphrase, ‘Whatever We Know, Whatever We Think,’ and we try to share that as much as we can,” he told HuffPost last year. On Wednesday night, Denton lauded the company’s spirit and accomplishments before a gathering of Gawker staff and alumni, as well as Manhattan media types from outlets like The New York Times, New York magazine and Vanity Fair. He recalled the early days of blogging and the budding desire at the time to not let “too much stand between the thoughts and the page.”“What you’re thinking, what you see, what you witness, you have an obligation to put it out there,” he said. “You have an obligation to tell the truth, and the whole truth, including even your preconceptions, to disclose everything. And I think I can say, for better, usually, occasionally for worse, we have said everything. Whatever has been on our minds, we have put out on the page, and I don’t think there’s any other group of writers, anywhere in the world, anywhere on the web, who can say that with as much conviction.”  CORRECTION: This piece originally stated Denton started his blog empire with Engadget.

19,POLITICS,Mothers In Immigrant Detention Vow To Continue Hunger Strike Until They're Released -- Or Dead,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mothers-immigrant-detention-hunger-strike_us_57b3698be4b04ff883990132,Many contend their rights were violated in previous deportation decisions.,2016-08-16,"Hannah Hafter, left, Adanjesus Marin and Marvin Hernandez, protest on Martha's Vineyard, where President Barack Obama is vacationing with his family.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mothers detained in a Pennsylvania family immigrant facility ― some for more than a year ― vow to continue a hunger strike that risks their health and potential deportation to what they say is serious danger in their native countries.Many also have joined a high-stakes legal battle seeking a declaration that their constitutional rights were violated and that they should be entitled to a new asylum hearing. If federal courts reject their claims, some immigrants in detention will have one less avenue to challenge how the government handles their removal proceedings.Twenty-two women are participating in the hunger strike at Berks County Family Residential Center, according to attorneys and activists. Immigration and Customs Enforcement put the total at 18. The women began the action Aug. 8 in protest of their long-term detention with their children. “WE WILL GET OUT ALIVE OR DEAD,” the women wrote in an open letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The women did not list their names, saying they feared retaliation, but included the amount of time they had been in detention and the ages of their children. Four mothers have been detained with their children for more than a year, and six have been held for more than 300 days, according to the letter. The children range in age from 2 to 16. The hunger strikers are part of an often overlooked piece of the family immigrant detention system. The Berks facility holds up to about 100 people and predates two much larger federal centers created after an influx of women and children apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2014. Those facilities, Karnes County Residential Center and South Texas Family Residential Center, have held thousands of women and children, some for lengthy periods. But legal challenges and political pressure led the Obama administration to try to speed up the time frame for families remaining in detention. Johnson told reporters this month that most women and children in family facilities were detained for 20 days or less. The women in Berks are allowed to use the internet and follow the news, one of them said in a phone interview. When they saw Johnson’s comments, which were highlighted by immigrant rights advocates, they decided to begin a hunger strike to call attention to their long-term detention, she said. “I would like to have a meeting with Jeh Johnson face to face and ask him why he’s saying the things that he’s saying when I have been here for almost a year,” the woman, who asked not to be identified by name, said through an interpreter. She said the strikers would continue to refuse to eat as long as necessary to get out of detention.They received support on Monday from protesters on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, where President Barack Obama is vacationing with his family. The activists called for Berks to be closed.Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said in a statement on Tuesday that 18 women at Berks had refused food for 72 hours or more. The agency “takes very seriously the health, safety, and welfare of those in our care and we continue to monitor the situation,” the statement said. ICE didn’t comment on individual women’s cases, but said there are many factors that contribute to the length of time a person is detained. Many, but not all, of the women involved in the hunger strike are also part of a shared legal battle over their deportation orders. These women were placed into what the government calls expedited removal proceedings at the border, and were not given asylum. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, they filed petitions in federal court ― combined in a case called Castro v. DHS ― saying they should receive new asylum screenings due to legal errors in their previous reviews. The legal fight has turned to whether the women have the constitutional right to appeal at all. The government has argued that habeas corpus, or the right to challenge illegal imprisonment, does not apply to these families and that they cannot turn to federal courts for relief.A federal judge sided with the government in February. The women appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit and are awaiting a ruling.Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, said non-citizens on U.S. soil have always been able to access the courts to challenge the legality of their deportation. The case does not require that the women be released, but Gelernt and other attorneys argue they should be let out as they await a decision. “There is no reason why these women and young children should be in detention for this long,” Gelernt said in an email. “The Administration is seemingly refusing to release them simply because they brought a constitutional test case. We hope the Administration will do the right thing and release them while the case works its way through the courts.”Cristian Farias contributed reporting."

Nearly one-quarter of those surveyed believe problems in the criminal justice system will be the most important issue for the next president. Only 17 percent of respondents said that in a similar January survey. Additionally, 72 percent of millennials surveyed believe “police violence against African Americans is a problem,” an increase of 11 percentage points since the January version of the survey.The poll was conducted prior to the violent protests that erupted in Milwaukee in response to the fatal police shooting of Sylville Smith, a 23-year-old black man. Officers opened fire on Smith on Saturday as he fled a traffic stop, reportedly after confronting police with a gun in hand.The unrest in Milwaukee follows a string of protests against police brutality toward black men and women in major U.S. cities over the past few years. Opinions about the intersection of police violence and race remain sharply divided along partisan lines, according to a USA Today story accompanying the release of the poll. By a margin of 6-1, supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton say police brutality against black Americans is a problem. Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, however, are split in their responses.Meanwhile, 75 percent of Clinton supporters and 88 percent of Trump supporters say they are “very concerned about the safety of police officers doing their jobs in the current political environment.” While tensions between police departments and black communities continue to fester, Election Day is fast approaching.Younger voters overwhelmingly support a Clinton presidency, according to the poll, which finds that 56 percent of millennials would support Clinton and only 20 percent would support Trump in a two-way race. Meanwhile, 15 percent say they won’t vote. But even when Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein are added to the fray, Clinton gets 50 percent support from younger voters, while Trump wins a meager 18 percent. Johnson walks away with 11 percent and Stein takes 4 percent, while another 8 percent say they’re unsure who they’d vote for and 10 percent say they will not vote.The poll was conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs from Aug. 5-10 and surveyed a national sample of 1,539 adults ages 18-34.

The deluge started with heavy rainfall Friday. First responders have rescued more than 20,000 people; on Tuesday, officials updated the death toll to 11.“I was calling 911, but I couldn’t get them on the phone,” Baker resident Margaret Teague told NOLA.com on Sunday. Teague, whose home in an eastern suburb of Baton Rouge was partially destroyed, lost another home to Hurricane Katrina 11 years ago. AT&T service was down for an unknown number of residents in the metro Baton Rouge region after a switching tower that directs cellular phone traffic flooded, further complicating rescue and evacuation efforts. Teague told NOLA.com her family was among residents bounced from one makeshift shelter to the next before finding one where they could remain.Roughly 120 people from a Baton Rouge Salvation Army shelter had to evacuate after the headquarters flooded with more than six feet of water, The Associated Press reported. Other families had to sleep on the floors of shelters that had run out of beds, state Department of Children and Family Services head Marketa Walters told Reuters. Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), who on Friday declared a state of emergency, was forced to evacuate the governor’s mansion in Baton Rouge with his family. Mike Steele, communications director for the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, told weather.com on Sunday that rescue efforts were “all hands on deck.” Steele said motorists were stranded on Interstate 12, and parts of the highway remained closed. At least 2,700 homes from Baton Rouge to the eastern rural Tangipahoa Parish have flooded, he added. The flooding has prevented some businesses, including those that sell necessities, from opening. “The Albertsons here has food and everything and they will not open,” said Nathan Songy, who lives in a city called Denham Springs. “The corporate store said they had to close the store because it’s unsafe for employees. The police department has asked them to open it because they did not want another Katrina situation where there would be looting.”People are allowed in the store to use the bathroom, but not to buy anything, Songy said. “There was a policeman there and he said, ‘I’m worried for my own safety. I don’t want to have to face them and tell them they can’t buy something here,’” he said.A spokeswoman for Albertsons later clarified the Denham Springs store was not closed due an unwillingness to serve customers, but because it had been “commandeered by Homeland Security and used as a command center and evacuee shelter.” President Barack Obama on Sunday issued a disaster declaration that makes affected parishes eligible for federal relief. According to the Advocate: The federal declaration that Louisiana suffered a major disaster frees the federal government to pay about 75 percent of the state’s expenditures in dealing with the emergency. Higher matches, up to 90 percent federal dollars to 10 percent of state spending, are available depending on how expensive the disaster eventually becomes. Just five months earlier, Louisiana was slammed by springtime flooding. The cost of the latest damage hasn’t been estimated. State Trooper Bryan Lee told The Huffington Post Monday that financial issues aren’t a priority for now.“One of the challenges we’re facing is the interstate system being closed, and getting resources and rescuing people that need to be rescued,” Lee said. “As far as financial issues, that’s something we’re not concerned with right now.” Lee estimated that nearly 4,000 residents were being housed at metro Baton Rouge-area shelters, including 3,000 people at the Celtic Studios ― a movie studio.Jay Dardenne, Louisiana’s commissioner of administration, told the Advocate the state is spending whatever necessary responding to the floods for search, rescue, shelter and evacuation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which handles disaster- assistance, has been under pressure from Congress to trim how much the federal government gives to states for disaster response. Louisiana has frequent natural disasters from floods and hurricanes, but is poorer than states like California, which faces wildfires. That financial situation complicates Louisiana’s ability to recover from disasters and invest in prevention efforts.Jesse Pines, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, wrote in a 2014 report that funding for disaster planning and recovery tends to be “lumpy.” “A disaster happens and there’s a big flood of resources to take care of the disaster,” Pines said. “And over time as different disasters hit and there are different funding priorities, there’s less money being invested in prevention.” David Lohr contributed reporting from Baton Rouge.

23,BLACK VOICES,Displaced Baton Rouge Residents Say Devastating Floods Are A Wakeup Call,David Lohr and Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baton-rouge-flood-victims_us_57b3690de4b0edfa80d9cfab,"Residents of an area beset by months of natural disasters, racial tension and civil unrest say they're hopeful for unity.",2016-08-16,"A member of the St. George Fire Department assists residents as they wade through floodwaters from heavy rains in the Chateau Wein Apartments in Baton Rouge, Aug. 12, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BATON ROUGE, Louisiana ― The devastating floods that have engulfed the area since last week may not be of biblical proportions, but to some displaced residents, the flooding feels like another plague visited on a region already weary from a year of natural disaster, civil unrest and deadly shootings. “This community has been through a lot in the past few months with the shootings and the racial issues. Now this. It’s all been back-to-back,” said Baton Rouge nurse Aron Coates, who came to the makeshift shelter at Celtic Studios to offer assistance to flood evacuees. Coates was among several people The Huffington Post interviewed Monday at the Baton Rouge movie warehouse-turned-shelter and the surrounding area where an estimated 3,000 people are being housed. Local media has dubbed the disaster “The Great Flood of 2016,” while the Red Cross said it’s undergoing the largest relief effort since Hurricane Sandy.Like many of her fellow Baton Rougeans, Coates is alarmed at the flood’s devastation and exhausted to see the area and its people beset by yet another tragedy in a matter of months. The mid-August floods mark the second time in 2016 the state had seen more than 24 inches of rainfall from a single event. In March, historic floods hit Louisiana, overflowing rivers and swallowing up homes.In early July, a Baton Rouge police officer was caught on video violently shooting Alton Sterling, a black Baton Rouge man who was selling CDs in front of a friend’s convenience store. Sterling’s death prompted days of intense protests against such use of force in a city of historic racial tension where some residents say police treat the black community like second class citizens.Less than two weeks later, a Missouri man killed three Baton Rouge-area police in an ambush-style attack and prompted another period of mourning in the community. Racial inequality has been a thread woven through many of the state’s recent tragedies, be they natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina or police killings of black, and often poor, residents. Several evacuees who spoke to HuffPost expressed hope that amid the devastation from the deadly floods, residents could find common ground. “What’s happening now is a very tragic thing,” Coates said. “But it’s like Mother Nature is trying to purge everything out and bring us together.” “Right now people aren’t concerned about black versus white,” she added. “We’re all just trying to survive and get everybody back on their feet. So it kind of washed all that away. ...I think in the long run it will be a healing thing.”Pat Payne, 61, has lived in Baton Rouge since 1993. She and her husband, Brian, were staying at the shelter after losing everything in the flood. “There’s nothing left,” Payne said. “What you see on our backs is it.The flooding started Sunday morning when Brian told her water was coming onto their yard.“Then the next thing we knew it was in our house. Everything is ruined. They had to come get us by boat,” she said. Now, the couple plans to leave to stay with friends. “As bad as it is, everybody is coming together and helping each other by doing what they can. It’s good ― it’s good to see that.”Payne noted a Facebook comment Montrell Jackson ― one of the slain Baton Rouge police officers ― made before he was killed. “He said ‘Please don’t let hate infect your heart.’ I hope he’s looking down and seeing that hate is not infecting our hearts.”Ellen Anderson, 55, who has lived in Baton Rouge for two decades said that she, like the Paynes, has lost everything in this flood. Anderson had been living with her son and daughter-in-law.While Anderson was able to escape, her son has been trapped in the home since Thursday. “There was water up to the ceiling. We’re still waiting on them to rescue my son. The water is so high they can’t rescue him,” Anderson said. The current devastation has her looking at recent events differently now. “I think what has happened here is God is letting everybody know that he rules this country,” she said. “Ain’t no white lives matter or black lives matter. Everybody’s lives matter. This disaster shows us all that.”She added, “We’re all together here now and we have to love everybody. We can’t hate nobody.”Like many of her neighbors, Leslie James, a lifelong resident of Baton Rouge, said she’s been overwhelmed by recent events and now the flood. The 55-year-old said despite all of it, her faith has kept her going. “It’s a lot to deal with. We have seen so much division lately with law enforcement and the residents of this city and now this. It can be discouraging, but my faith keeps me encouraged amongst everything else,” James said. “I think this has brought us together the way we used to be. We care about each other, we look out for each other and we’re there for each other,” she continued. “I hope and pray people will continue to come together and that the leaders of the city, state and country will provide us with the necessary help we need to move on with our lives.”The floodwaters that engulfed 54-year-old Elnora Patterson’s house were unlike anything the lifelong Baton Rouge resident said she’s ever seen. “The water was up to the tip of the stop sign on my street. I kept saying, ‘Lord when is this rain going to stop?’ It was nonstop.”The epic floods felt to her like “God is trying to tell us something.” “It’s time for everyone to get their act together. Stop all this nonsense and love each other,” Patterson said. “There was so much negativity before this. We don’t show enough love towards each other, so God had to do something. He had to bring us together and look at us now. We’re all together here and everyone is helping everyone.” With so many residents stripped down to nothing, Patterson said previous divisions don’t matter right now. “We’re all in the same room. We’re together now and that’s what God wanted us to do,” she said. “Sometimes it takes bad things to happen for good things to happen.”Outside Celtic Studios in the heavily-damaged Denham Springs area, resident AJ Herbert said everyone is helping one another despite their losses. An estimated 90 percent of the homes in the area have flooded. “I’m at a loss for words,” said Herbert, a football coach at the local high school. On Saturday, he went out to the subdivision with other motorists who had “jacked up vehicles” to help evacuate residents onto boats. “I was nervous because the current was moving so fast that it was pushing vehicles off the road. One lady we rescued was paralyzed from the neck down. We had to get her and her chair out of her place and into a boat. There was a lot of elderly people.”Herbert guesses he made about 20 trips over 10 hours.“The community really came together,” he said. “It’s sad it takes an event like this to pull people together, but it didn’t matter who you was if you could lend a hand, you was.“There was people who knew they lost everything, but if they was able to help other people they was doing it.”David Lohr reported from Baton Rouge.

26,POLITICS,North Carolina Took 17 Days To Ask Supreme Court To Rescue Its Voter ID Law,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-voter-id-law-supreme-court_us_57b23f3ce4b0863b0284666a,But the state says it wants the court to act quickly to avoid confusion come Election Day.,2016-08-16,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory called his state's voter ID law ""a model"" among the states. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit did not agree, and the state now wants the Supreme Court to address the matter.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b23fcd170000ae02c7353c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The state of North Carolina on Monday filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court so that it can enforce a broad set of voting restrictions that an appeals court in July called one of the worst “since the era of Jim Crow.”That ruling was significant because it found that North Carolina lawmakers purposefully targeted African-American voters, leading the court to invalidate the law in full ― including the voter ID provision and those restricting early voting, same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting.North Carolina said that restoring some of these requirements will minimize confusion on Election Day.“Maintaining the status quo ... and permitting this year’s general election to proceed under the same rules as this year’s primary election will avoid voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls,” the state’s lawyer, Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who specializes in Supreme Court practice, wrote in the petition.Notably, Clement didn’t ask the high court to reinstate the provisions eliminating same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting ― which means that North Carolina voters who intend to rely on those measures will have them at their disposal on Nov. 8.“This is a big win for plaintiffs” challenging the North Carolina law, wrote Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in voting rights and election law.But as Hasen noted, the timing of Monday’s petition seems to belie its “emergency” nature, since the original ruling was issued 17 days ago and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) had vowed to be more timely in asking the high court to intervene ― a delay that may tell the justices the state may not really be in a big rush.In a statement, McCrory didn’t address the delay but said the state’s voter ID law remained “a model” among the states, and that allowing the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to keep it on hold will bring confusion at the polls.“The Fourth Circuit’s ruling is just plain wrong and we cannot allow it to stand,” McCrory said. “We are confident that the Supreme Court will uphold our state’s law and reverse the Fourth Circuit.”But maybe the Fourth Circuit will have the last word. Days after the court’s sweeping ruling striking down North Carolina’s voting restrictions, the state reassured the court that it could comply with its mandate ahead of the election ― which the court saw as a sign that the state was ready to move on.“Because of these assurances, we are confident that North Carolina can conduct the 2016 election in compliance with our injunction,” the Fourth Circuit said earlier this month.The state will need to convince at least five justices that its voting law is worth saving."
27,THE WORLDPOST,Explorers In Poland Are Digging For Legendary Nazi Gold,Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nazi-gold-train_us_57b33fb6e4b0863b0284f882,They're hunting for a treasure-filled train that is rumored to have disappeared in a secret tunnel at the end of World War II.,2016-08-16,Explorers are searching for a Nazi train loaded with looted treasure that is believed to have vanished en-route to Berlin in southwestern Poland at the end of the Second World War.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b37fe51700009504c73995.jpeg?cache=GHzyzBabSs&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rumor has it, a Nazi train loaded with looted gems and treasure vanished en-route to Berlin in southwestern Poland at the end of the Second World War, though many experts dispute its existence. In the midst of international speculation and intrigue, two explorers are literally digging their way to the truth.Piotr Koper of Poland and Andreas Richter of Germany believe the mysterious train was hidden from the Soviet Red Army in a secret tunnel constructed by Nazis near the Polish city of Walbrzych. Soil anomalies detected in the area with radar equipment last year indicate its presence, they claim.Geological experts from Krakow’s AGH University of Science and Technology found no evidence of the train when searching with magnetic equipment, the Associated Press reports, but their findings did conclude that there may in fact be a tunnel located at the site of Koper and Richter’s privately-funded excavation.The pair began the treasure hunt on Tuesday with a team of researchers and volunteers, despite warnings that it could be a pointless mission. “There may be a tunnel. There is no train,” said Prof. Janusz Madej of the university in Krakow, who was involved in the study.In contrast to Madej’s assertion, search committee spokesperson Andrzej Gaik said Tuesday that if the tunnel exists, “there should be a train there.”“The train is not a needle in the haystack; if there is one, we will find it,” he added. “It’s so exciting and we count on success.”While skeptics believe the latest search efforts are a waste of time, Polish media have reported that up to 300 tons of gold could be aboard the train, the Washington Post notes.Koper and Richter believe the dig will take less than two weeks, meaning an end to the decades-long mystery could be in sight."

But critics say it could do more.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b3487f170000ae02c73834.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The tech giants that manufacture mobile phones should provide the means for consumers to recycle old devices, according to a survey released Monday of about 6,000 people in six countries.The research, conducted by independent polling service Ipsos MORI on behalf of Greenpeace’s East Asia branch, polled adults in China, South Korea, Germany, Mexico, Russia and the United States. Nearly half of respondents overall agreed that it’s up to companies ― as opposed to the government or network providers, for example ― to help consumers recycle their devices. Many manufacturers, like Apple, do give consumers those means. But their practices aren’t perfect.More than half of respondents also said companies are releasing new phone models too quickly. Environmental groups argue that the constant stream of upgrades encourages people to buy a new device instead of repairing their existing ones. As a result, tossed-out iPhones and Androids make up much of the 3 million metric tons of hazardous electronic waste generated each year, according to a 2014 study by the United Nations.“The humble smartphone puts enormous strain on our environment from the moment they are produced ― often with hazardous chemicals ― to the moment they are disposed of in huge e-waste sites,” Chih An Lee, a campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia, said in a statement. “Over half of respondents across the countries surveyed agree that manufacturers are releasing too many new models, many designed to only last a few years.”Issues with recycling modern electronics aren’t new: Tech companies across the board appear to be focusing on smaller, slimmer products over recyclability, as The Huffington Post reported in June.For example, many of Apple’s designs for iPads, MacBooks and iPhones make it hard ― and even impossible ― to repair them or recycle them safely. The company has been fighting a secret war in the states over legislation that would force it to hand over schematics and instructions ― and, much to Apple’s chagrin, proprietary information ― to recyclers.And while Apple offers refurbished models of its products and has a recycling process in place, the company has long been against third-party repair shops. There’s also little way of knowing whether your iProduct is being recycled responsibly in the first place.Apple didn’t return a request for comment, but the company has maintained its dedication to recycling programs. It told HuffPost this year that it helps recycle millions of pounds of electronics equipment every year. Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer, also did not respond to a request for comment.The inability of the average consumer to recycle or repair their devices in the way they want, along with an ever-increasing frequency of new products, helps create a consumer base that’s more likely to buy a new item than go through the process of recycling. But surveyed consumers seem keen on that option.Greenpeace’s answer to the problem is the same one HuffPost has reported on for months: We need products with a design that allows for recycling in the first place.“The new product design,” the Greenpeace report concludes, “should take recycling into consideration from the beginning of the production phase, using the recycled materials instead of virgin materials, and making the products easier to be dismantled at the end.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Apple is fighting in court against legislation that would force it to hand over schematics and instructions to recyclers. It is lobbying state legislatures on the issue."

The’ve committed to making about 5,000 meals a day for homeless people and other groups in need, according to Reuters. Olympic village is a pretty auspicious spot for collecting foodstuffs. The chefs there are tasked with feeding 18,000 athletes, coaches and officials, and use about 250 tons of raw ingredients for each meal, according to The New York Times. The program will continue through the Paralympics, which start Sept 7.The delicious idea was cooked up by famed Italian chef Massimo Bottura, HuffPost Italy reported. Last year, during Milan’s Universal Exposition, Bottura employed a similar approach to prevent suitable food from the event from ending up in the garbage. He partnered with the Vatican and about 60 acclaimed chefs to launch the Refettorio Amborsiano (Ambrosian Refectory), a dining hall that served leftovers from the Expo to needy people in the city.Bottura and his crew transformed 15 tons of discarded food into delicious dishes and gave them out to homeless people.He got together with David Hertz of Brazil who founded a group that empowers people in need by teaching them to cook.But Bottura told The Times that his initiative isn’t just about rescuing food. It’s about opening up people’s eyes to the world’s global food waste crisis.Up to one third of all food is spoiled or squandered before it’s consumed by people, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. At the 2012 Olympics in London alone, massive amounts of food were wasted. In a single day, one employee claimed to discard 45 pounds of prawns, 30 pounds of fish fillets, 90 pounds of vegetables, and 45 pounds of meat, according to Mother Jones. And while Brazil has made some notable gains in reducing its hunger rates, it hasn’t wiped out the issue.In 2014, the country was removed from the U.N.’s hunger map. The number of undernourished Brazilians had fallen by more than 80 percent in 10 years, the Associated Press reported.In 1992, there were 23 million people living with hunger. A decade later, that figure dropped to 13 million, according to a report released by FAO. To get his project off the ground, Bottura had to first convince the mayor of Rio to provide an empty lot. He then went on to raise $250,000. While donors were generous, the initiative ran over budget and Bottura is now working raise to $190,000, according to The Times.While Bottura may need more funds for the operations, he’s demonstrating how much value can be churned out from what was once considered “garbage.”On Thursday night, for example, guests were treated to a delectable meal that included Italian-style couscous with sautéed beef and panzanella, a Tuscan bread-and-tomato dish.“We mostly hope to become an example for others,” Bottura told HuffPost Italy, “and that work like ours will help favor social integration through a commitment to fighting waste and redistributing resources. We would like to see the commitment to this cultural project expand and multiply all over the world.”"

The chefs there are tasked with feeding 18,000 athletes, coaches and officials, and use about 250 tons of raw ingredients for each meal, according to The New York Times. The program will continue through the Paralympics, which start Sept 7.The delicious idea was cooked up by famed Italian chef Massimo Bottura, HuffPost Italy reported. Last year, during Milan’s Universal Exposition, Bottura employed a similar approach to prevent suitable food from the event from ending up in the garbage. He partnered with the Vatican and about 60 acclaimed chefs to launch the Refettorio Amborsiano (Ambrosian Refectory), a dining hall that served leftovers from the Expo to needy people in the city.Bottura and his crew transformed 15 tons of discarded food into delicious dishes and gave them out to homeless people.He got together with David Hertz of Brazil who founded a group that empowers people in need by teaching them to cook.But Bottura told The Times that his initiative isn’t just about rescuing food. It’s about opening up people’s eyes to the world’s global food waste crisis.Up to one third of all food is spoiled or squandered before it’s consumed by people, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. At the 2012 Olympics in London alone, massive amounts of food were wasted. In a single day, one employee claimed to discard 45 pounds of prawns, 30 pounds of fish fillets, 90 pounds of vegetables, and 45 pounds of meat, according to Mother Jones. And while Brazil has made some notable gains in reducing its hunger rates, it hasn’t wiped out the issue.In 2014, the country was removed from the U.N.’s hunger map. The number of undernourished Brazilians had fallen by more than 80 percent in 10 years, the Associated Press reported.In 1992, there were 23 million people living with hunger. A decade later, that figure dropped to 13 million, according to a report released by FAO. To get his project off the ground, Bottura had to first convince the mayor of Rio to provide an empty lot. He then went on to raise $250,000. While donors were generous, the initiative ran over budget and Bottura is now working raise to $190,000, according to The Times.While Bottura may need more funds for the operations, he’s demonstrating how much value can be churned out from what was once considered “garbage.”On Thursday night, for example, guests were treated to a delectable meal that included Italian-style couscous with sautéed beef and panzanella, a Tuscan bread-and-tomato dish.“We mostly hope to become an example for others,” Bottura told HuffPost Italy, “and that work like ours will help favor social integration through a commitment to fighting waste and redistributing resources. We would like to see the commitment to this cultural project expand and multiply all over the world.”"

The 384-page book, titled Walk Through Walls, is being heavily promoted, with the artist’s Facebook page also advertising the signed “chic and artistic” collector’s edition, which “comes with an uncoated cover enclosed in an elegant die-cut slipcase featuring black foil stamping on the spine.” (Readers may also compare the limited-edition cover to a high-priced version of Connect Four.)The memoir is billed as “a vivid and powerful rendering of the unparalleled life of an extraordinary artist.”But a photo of an excerpt from the book posted online is causing outrage due to a passage in which the durational performance artist says that Aboriginal Australians “look like dinosaurs,” and follows this bizarre “observation” with some truly offensive statements.New York-based writer Rachel Wetzler put up a photo of a page from the upcoming book on Instagram, where the artist describes her time in the Northern Territory in the late 1970s, with then-collaborator and partner Ulay. The Instagram image has since been removed, but not before other users shared it.“Aborigines are not just the oldest race in Australia; they are the oldest race on the planet. They look like dinosaurs,” the artist muses. “They are really strange and different, and they should be treated as living treasures. Yet, they are not,” she continues.What follows is a truly jaw-dropping passage in which the Slavic artist engages in racist pseudo-science. “To Western eyes they look terrible,” she writes. “Their faces are like no other faces on earth; they have big torsos (just one bad result of their encounter with Western civilization is a high-sugar diet that bloats their bodies) and sticklike legs.”According to the Daily Mail, Abramovic, who had a survey show in David Walsh’s MONA Museum in Australia last year, claimed in an interview that the Australian desert was a major influence on her. “Australia is so much a part of me. It’s the beginning of all my best work,” she told the Australian in 2013.The leaked passage was harshly criticized on social media, with commenters on Twitter taking aim at the artist, her publishers, and editors with hashtag #theracistispresent.Meanwhile, indigenous Australians are posting pictures of dinosaurs, captioning them “self portrait.”artnet News reached out to the Marina Abramović Institute, her publisher, Crown Archetype, and her gallery, Sean Kelly, but did not receive immediate responses."

He denies any involvement.Police began searches in the Uskudar and Umraniye districts of Istanbul, including buildings belonging to an unnamed holding company, the agency said.Since the coup, more than 35,000 people have been detained, of whom 17,000 have been placed under formal arrest, and tens of thousands more suspended in a purge of Turkey’s military, law-and-order, education and justice systems.Erdogan accuses Gulen of harnessing an extensive network of schools, charities and businesses, built up in Turkey and abroad over decades, to infiltrate state institutions and build a “parallel structure” that aimed to take over the country.He vowed this month to cut off the revenues of businesses linked to Gulen, describing them as “nests of terrorism” and promising no mercy in rooting them out.Before the failed coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, the authorities had already seized Islamic lender Bank Asya, taken over or closed several media companies and detained businessmen on allegations of funding the cleric’s movement.As part of the coup investigation, police also searched offices at the main courthouse on the Asian side of Istanbul on Wednesday as they raided the complex with detention warrants for 83 judicial personnel, Anadolu reported.A day earlier police detained at least 136 court staff in raids on three halls of justice, including Turkey’s largest courthouse, on the European side of the city.A former lawmaker from the ruling AK Party, Aydin Biyiklioglu, was also remanded in custody along with seven academics in the Black Sea city of Trazbon as part of the investigation, Anadolu said.

The mayor banned burkinis on Monday.Apart from the Paris attacks, a Tunisian deliberately drove a truck into crowds in Nice on July 14, killing 85 people, and a Roman Catholic priest had his throat cut in church by two French Muslims.The string of attacks have made many people jumpy. On Sunday, 41 people were injured in a stampede in the Riviera town of Juan-les-Pins when holiday makers mistook the sound of firecrackers for gunfire.Villeneuve-Loubet mayor Lionnel Luca, member of the hardline Droite Populaire faction of the conservative Les Republicains party, said the burkini was an ideological provocation.“Since the Nice attack, the population is particularly sensitive,” he told Le Parisien.He said the burkini raised hygiene issues and could make rescue at sea more difficult.The advocacy group Collective Against Islamophobia in France on Tuesday filed a complaint against the bans with the Conseil d’Etat, France’s highest administrative court, which is expected to hand down a ruling in the coming days.CCIF spokesman Marwan Muhammad said the bans restricted fundamental liberties and discriminated against Muslim women.“This summer we are witnessing a hysterical political Islamophobia that pits citizens against one another,” he said.Non-Muslims who wear burkinis or garments that are similar to the clothing include some Orthodox Jewish women and those who wish to keep their bodies covered. British celebrity chef Nigella Lawson made headlines when she was photographed wearing a burkini to the beach in Australia."
