0,POLITICS,"Judge Wants Government To Hand Over Names, Addresses Of Thousands Of Dreamers",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judge-andrew-hanen-dreamers_us_573f2d2de4b00e09e89ed3ef,"The young immigrants didn't do anything wrong, but they could have their identities exposed to hostile state governments anyway.",2016-05-20,Hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants have received work permits under the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. An expansion of the policy is blocked in the courts. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"About 108,000 young undocumented immigrants received three-year protections and U.S. work permits in a several-month period in late 2014 and early 2015. They hadn't done anything wrong -- they just applied for a government program in the same way hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers have done since the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program started in 2012. But the fact that they got those three-year permits, rather than the two-year permits distributed since 2012, could put them at risk of having their personal information -- including names and addresses -- released to state authorities. This would be as a result of a Thursday court order by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, who last year blocked President Barack Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration reform -- namely, an expansion of DACA and a new program for parents called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.The Supreme Court is currently considering whether those executive actions should be allowed to move forward. But in the meantime, Hanen, who is based in Brownsville, Texas, is railing from the bench over the Justice Department attorneys' actions in his court, where the lawsuit from 26 states started. Hanen's latest court order rebukes Justice Department attorneys for their conduct in proceedings for Obama's 2014 executive actions. It also demands that the federal government hand over a list of certain DACA recipients in the 26 states that sued over Obama's immigration programs. The list wouldn't just be names -- Hanen ordered the government to include the DACA recipients' addresses, contact information and dates when their work permits were renewed or granted. Hanen also requested the recipients' ""A"" numbers, which are used by immigration enforcement to identify undocumented immigrants.Hanen ordered the Justice Department to give him a sealed copy of this list by June 10, and said it would remain sealed until the Supreme Court issues a decision. At that point, though, he said states could request that the court release some or part of the list to authorities if they showed good cause that the information included would minimize or prevent harm in that state.The federal government already has all of this information, of course. The chief selling point of DACA and DAPA was that they would help federal immigration authorities identify undocumented immigrants with strong ties to the community who would not be priorities for deportation, so they could focus on removing other people instead. But Hanen's order could put the list in the hands of state authorities who oppose Obama's actions to protect undocumented immigrants. It's not clear what the state authorities would do with that information. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) issued a statement Thursday applauding the broader order. A spokeswoman for Paxton declined to elaborate on whether the state sought that information or what it would do with it.Either way, it's a frightening prospect for Dreamers, particularly as they prepare for the potential presidency of Republican Donald Trump, who has vowed not just to end DACA but to deport or drive out all undocumented immigrants. ‚ÄúJudge Hanen knows that DACA beneficiaries have been thriving, yet he‚Äôs asking for the personal information of young people just to whip up fear,"" Greisa Martinez, advocacy director of the group United We Dream, said in a statement. ""It‚Äôs one more example of anti-immigrant extremists using the courts to advance the Republican hate agenda."" The backstory on who would be included and how the order came about is a bit complicated. Obama established DACA in 2012. In November 2014, he announced plans to create DAPA and expand DACA to a broader group of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, set for implementation in the spring of 2015. He also said the government would grant three-year work permits, rather than the two-year permits granted under the 2012 iteration of DACA. After that announcement, the government continued to issue DACA permits and to renew them for people who fit the requirements for the initial iteration of the program. And the permits it issued were for three years, rather than two. Therein lies the controversy. By the time Hanen issued a preliminary injunction on the 2014 executive actions in February 2015, the government had already granted about 108,000 three-year work permits to DACA recipients who fit the requirements of the 2012 program. (The 2012 version of the program was not part of the lawsuit, and is still in effect.) Hanen has accused the Justice Department of being deceptive by failing initially to state clearly that this aspect of the executive actions had already begun. He ordered the government to rescind those three-year permits. The government did not rescind the permits granted before the injunction date, but it did recall any issued in error since then. It is now only granting two-year permits, and only to people who were eligible for the original version of DACA.Hanen now wants a list of people who, as he puts it in the court order, received three-year permits during the period ""in which the attorneys for the Justice Department promised that no benefits were being conferred."" Since this only applies to the 26 states that joined the anti-immigration action lawsuit, it's not clear how many of the 108,000 Dreamers from the period in question would be included. United We Dream has launched a petition to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking her not to give the courts the undocumented young people's information. The Justice Department on Friday declined to comment on the order for a list. A spokesman told reporters in a statement on Thursday that the department ""strongly disagrees with the order,"" but did not say whether it plans to appeal."

The measure was introduced just hours after lawmakers in the budget-challenged state set itself up for a bruising legal fight after approving a bill that would make abortions a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for doctors who perform them.Abortion rights groups have promised a court battle if Governor Mary Fallin, an anti-abortion Republican, approves the measure."

That was significantly less than the $30 million available to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. Sanders‚Äô cash-on-hand deficiency followed heavy spending by his campaign in the previous three months. The independent Vermont senator‚Äôs insurgent campaign spent $160 million from January through April, bringing its total spending to $202 million.In April, the Sanders campaign fired hundreds of staffers as it pivoted toward the final primaries and caucuses of the long election season.The Sanders camp raised $27 million in April, with $11 million coming from donors who each gave less than $200. Much of his other donations came from repeat donors who had given a total of more than $200. Clinton‚Äôs campaign raised $25 million -- $26.4 million including allocation from the Hillary Victory Fund. Her campaign spent $24 million in April.The two Democratic presidential candidates' campaigns have raised almost identical sums, according to FEC reports -- $212 million for Sanders, compared with Clinton‚Äôs $211 million. The Clinton campaign said in a press release that its total fundraising was slightly above $213 million.Sanders created a microsite to tout his campaign's historic fundraising. It says the senator raised money from 2.4 million donors, a record at this stage in the race. The campaign said it had received 7.6 million donations -- about 13 per minute. The average age of donors was a remarkable 27.The Clinton campaign said that it has raised money from 1.2 million donors."
5,POLITICS,Hedge Funds Launch New Lobbying Effort To Protect Their Power,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hedge-fund-lobbying_us_573f51f9e4b045cc9a70e6ca,The new lobbying campaign comes amid attacks from Democratic politicians.,2016-05-20,Carl Icahn is one of five activist investors launching a new lobbying group to promote their agenda.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573f527b1a00008800c29324.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Billionaire activist investors are joining forces to raid Congress for more power.According to a Wall Street Journal report, hedge fund operators Paul Singer, Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman, Barry Rosenstein and Dan Loeb formed a lobbying trade group called the Council for Investor Rights and Corporate Accountability, or CIRCA. The new group will push back against recent efforts to reform rules allowing activist shareholders, like the group‚Äôs founders, to raid companies to maximize shareholder profit, often at the expense of workers‚Äô jobs. It comes at the same time hedge funds are waging under-the-radar lobbying battles on issues in which they have investments, like Puerto Rican debt and Fannie Mae, to increase their profits.Activist investors like Icahn, Ackman and Loeb are known for using their funds to invest in companies that they believe could be producing more value for shareholders. They use those investments to secure board seats and then press for changes that often include merging with competitors, selling off parts of the company, pushing up the price of drugs, moving production overseas and, in many cases, firing large numbers of workers.The policy fight they enter with their new lobbying muscle is one over who will hold power at big corporations -- individual wealthy investors or corporate managers.CIRCA clearly believes that investors need more power over big companies, which means more power over the national economy. The group‚Äôs senior adviser Rob Collins, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said in a statement that it will pursue ‚Äúa well-functioning system of checks and balances between boards of directors and shareholders.‚Äù The statement clearly implies that the hedge fund billionaires believe they must maintain and expand their power over the direction of corporate policies.The hedge fund lobbying group‚Äôs formation also comes as Democrats have taken a sharper focus against activist tactics, such as pushing for short-term shareholder dividends or purchasing pharmaceutical drugs only to jack up the price astronomically.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has called for a new policy to move investors away from the short-term outlook of immediate shareholder gains, which cost jobs and may harm corporate profits and the economy in the long term. Clinton has called for higher taxes on those who cash out short-term investments -- a position also held by large, powerful investors who specialize in long-term investments.‚ÄúLarge public companies now return eight or nine out of every 10 dollars they earn directly back to shareholders, either in the form of dividends or stock buybacks which can temporarily boost share prices,‚Äù Clinton said in a speech in July 2015. ‚ÄúLast year the total reached a record $900 billion. That doesn‚Äôt leave much money to build a new factory or a research lab or to train workers or to give them a raise.‚ÄùDemocrats in Congress, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the latter also seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, have sponsored legislation to close the window for when activist investors must disclose their positions in companies.Some of the investments made by the founders of CIRCA have come under congressional and Securities and Exchange Commission investigation as well. Most noteworthy, Congress and the SEC have investigated Valeant Pharmaceuticals, in which Ackman's Pershing Square Management holds a large investment, for radically increasing the price of prescription drugs. Ackman was called to testify before a Senate panel investigating the drug price increases.While CIRCA will not have a political action committee, its billionaire founders are, for the most part, major political donors. Singer is one of the largest donors to the Republican Party. He has contributed at least $25 million in disclosed donations to Republican candidates, party committees and super PACs since 2011. Once a donor to President Barack Obama‚Äôs 2008 campaign, Loeb now gives almost exclusively to Republicans, with millions to the party‚Äôs super PACs. Ackman and Rosenstein mostly donate to Democratic politicians, but are not super PAC donors and have not contributed this election cycle. Icahn supports presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and recently threatened to create a $150 million super PAC to push for lower corporate taxes on overseas profits. He never created the super PAC.The past and present of activist investments by those leading CIRCA are riddled with tales of lost jobs. Icahn‚Äôs takeover and dismantling of TWA in the 1980s to pay back the debt he used to purchase the company‚Äôs stock is the most famous example, as it served as one of the inspirations for the plot to the 1987 Oliver Stone movie ""Wall Street.""More recently, Loeb, head of the hedge fund Third Point, has taken stakes in companies and forced them to fire thousands of workers and return the profits to investors like himself. In 2014, he used his position in the pharmaceutical company Amgen to push it to fire 1,100 workers, a move that drove the stock price up. At the end of 2015, Dow Chemical and DuPont, the two largest chemical manufacturers in the United States, announced plans to merge that would lead to the shuttering of offices, closure of plants and firing of 10 percent of their 54,000-person workforce. The move was pushed by Loeb, an investor in Dow, and two other hedge funds invested in DuPont.In Sidney, Nebraska, employees of Cabela‚Äôs, an outdoors retailer, could be victims of an investment in the company by Singer‚Äôs Elliott Management. If the company doesn‚Äôt go along with the hedge fund‚Äôs push to carve up the business, it may be targeted with an aggressive push to sell and be forced to shutter its headquarters, costing 2,000 jobs.Ackman‚Äôs Pershing Square Management has been embroiled in a years-long fight with the multi-level marketing nutritional supplement company Herbalife after shorting its stock. He has waged a lobbying and PR campaign to get the company labeled an illegal pyramid scheme by the Federal Trade Commission. If he were successful, his hedge fund would make huge returns on its bet against Herbalife‚Äôs stock.Activist investor strategies for immediate shareholder gratification have already influenced other corporate decisions even without their involvement. United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes says that corporate managers are the investors at the company. In February 2016, the air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier, a subsidiary of United Technologies, announced that it would close its Indianapolis plant and move operations to Mexico. At least 700 people lost their jobs. The move came months after the company announced a $12 billion stock buyback.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that Pershing Square Management, rather than Valeant Pharmaceuticals, is the target of congressional and SEC investigations."

A 2016 Gallup poll found that 53 percent of Americans 65 and older say they believe same-sex marriages should be recognized, with the same legal rights as traditional marriages. Although it's a 30-percent support drop from 18- to 29-year-olds, it's the first time since Gallup first polled on the issue in 1996 that the majority of older Americans said they think same-sex marriage should be fully legal.Forty-two percent of the same demographic said they supported same-sex marriage in 2014, up from 14 percent in January 1996. The rise in support among older Americans is consistent with the statistics across the board. The poll, which was based on telephone interviews conducted earlier this month with 1,025 adults, found that 61 percent of Americans said they supported same-sex marriages, a slight increase from 60 percent last year. Gallup analyst Justin McCarthy said he believed that the strong support for same-sex marriage across the U.S. will have a major impact on the 2016 presidential election. ""Americans' heightened approval of gay marriage this year makes the issue a fairly straightforward one for the remaining Democratic presidential candidates,"" he wrote. ""Not only do the vast majority of fellow Democrats agree with their stance, but they also have little to fear on the issue from the general electorate.""While Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has a checkered history with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, McCarthy believes that his party's ""tapering opposition"" to marriage equality makes it ""an ideal climate"" for the GOP frontrunner. Pointing to Trump's recent attendance at a same-sex wedding, he wrote, ""This is a marked departure from his former primary rival, Ted Cruz, who said he'd never attend a gay wedding if invited.""Head here to read more about the Gallup poll."

During his playing days in Los Angeles, Magic said he was never one to turn down a party, so you can only imagine the crazy catalog of Prince run-ins he must have. On late-night television, however, Magic opted to share one of his kookiest Prince interactions, or ""one of his greatest joys,"" as he put it. Magic used to own his own chain of movie theaters in the mid-'90s, and Prince was one of his most loyal customers, but with a catch: He would only come to the theater at 2 a.m ‚Äî which was usually closing time.  Prince was a known night owl, but even this request made Magic go, ""Like, what?"" But Prince is Prince, so of course Magic would have his manager and projectionist open up the theater for a late-late night showing. The first time this happened though, Magic was shocked at the sight of Prince and his posse rolling up. ""He brings this big bus full of people. Jimmy, when they get off, they're all in pajamas!"" Prince's late-night pajama watch parties became a recurring event for Magic, who was always more than happy to oblige. I mean, c'mon, it's Prince. During the interview with Kimmel, Magic also touched on Prince as a basketball player. But unlike past scouting reports, Magic's take on the singer's skills was dismissive. ""He talked so much trash! He thought he had a real jump shot,"" he said. ""He really thought he could play basketball.""So there you have it: Aside from being a late-night movie buff, Prince was a trash-talking baller with an outsized view of himself on the court. Still, from our perspective, that view always seemed to perfectly fit the man. "

Sanders has come out strongly against the House bill to aid the island.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573f75511a00002f00c29376.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House is set to move on Republican-crafted legislation next week that would give Puerto Rico powers to restructure its crippling debt. After one failed markup and three drafts, the hard part should be over.Or not. While Democratic leaders appear ready to support the revised bill, a number of progressives and unions representing workers on the island are concerned about the new text.Namely, some lawmakers are wary of the bill because it creates a seven-person financial oversight board authorized to help the commonwealth restructure its $70 billion in unpayable debt and draft an economic recovery plan.Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the strongest rebuke of any politician, calling the board a move in the ‚Äúwrong direction.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis undemocratic board would have the power to slash pensions, cut education and health care, and increase taxes on working families in Puerto Rico,‚Äù Sanders said in a statement issued by his Senate office. ‚ÄúThat is unacceptable.‚ÄùSanders argued that the oversight board will be structured in a way that favors Republican policies.‚ÄúMajority Leader [Mitch] McConnell (R-Ky.) and Speaker [Paul] Ryan (R-Wis.) would be in charge of handpicking a majority of the control board‚Äôs members, while the people of Puerto Rico would be in charge of choosing none,‚Äù he said. Sanders has opposed the Puerto Rico bill since its first draft emerged in late March. He has framed the island‚Äôs debt crisis as part of the Wall Street-versus-Main Street battle that has been a fundamental theme of his campaign -- a message he took to Puerto Rico on Monday, where he was campaigning ahead of the island‚Äôs Democratic primary on June 5.Hillary Clinton, who is leading Sanders in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, offered qualified support for the House legislation in a statement released by her campaign.Meanwhile, House Democrats like Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), chair of the House Democratic Caucus, and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) are withholding their support for the bill until they review more of the text. ""My hope is to support a bill that helps the people of Puerto Rico, that protects them from the vulture capitalist hedge funds that want to cash-in on the Island's misery,‚Äù Gutierrez said in a statement after the bill‚Äôs release.The oversight board raised some red flags for Gutierrez, he said, but he wants to get to a ‚Äúyes.‚Äù That's precisely the predicament Democrats and the Obama administration are facing: This isn‚Äôt the bill they would have written, but they're running out of time as the commonwealth stares down the barrel of a $2 billion default on July 1.It also appears to be the only kind of legislation that can pass an obscenely gridlocked Congress.Still, the AFL-CIO labor federation and several individual unions representing some 50,000 Puerto Rican workers oppose the bill -- including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Service Employees International Union, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.In a letter to Congress, the unions say the bill fails to ‚Äúprotect the accrued pension benefits of Puerto Rican workers and retirees, retain worker protections that apply to all working people in the U.S. including minimum wage and overtime protections, and preserve the democratic rights of the people of Puerto Rico.‚ÄùRoberto Pagan, president of SEIU‚Äôs 29,000-worker-strong Puerto Rico chapter, said he was concerned that five out of seven board members must vote to approve a court-supervised debt restructuring process in which a federal judge could force write-downs on creditors. (Other budgetary changes would only need four votes.)Pagan said court-supervised restructuring would be unlikely if four people on the board are selected by congressional Republicans. (The remaining 3 seats on the board will be nominated by Democrats, and President Barack Obama will have the final say on all choices.) Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA, a religious anti-poverty group and proponent of restructuring Puerto Rico's debt, endorsed the bill while acknowledging it is not ‚Äúperfect.‚ÄùLeCompte argued that even the threat of court-supervised restructuring would create an incentive for parties to reach a voluntary agreement to put Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt on a sustainable path.The bill contains other provisions that give Puerto Rico‚Äôs government more leverage over creditors, LeCompte said. He described an ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù clause that would require all creditors in a given bond pool to proceed with a voluntary restructuring deal if the lenders holding two-thirds of that pool's bonds agreed to it. This would prevent a small number of holdouts from blocking a resolution, he said -- something that was a problem in Argentina and other countries plagued by sovereign debt crises.‚ÄúSpeaker Ryan (R-Wis.), Chairman Bishop (R-Utah) and Rep. Duffy (R-Wis.) have really strongly stood against the special interests,‚Äù LeCompte said. ‚ÄúIt is really pretty amazing that they put the people of Puerto Rico first and a small group of creditors second.‚ÄùIt's not entirely clear what viable alternatives are available to Puerto Rico if this legislation fails.Some progressive detractors do not even see the need for them.‚ÄúIt is better to have nothing than this law, because it does not give any protection to the pensions of the retirees, or provide an economic growth plan,‚Äù Pagan said.But the labor leader and other critics of the bill suggested a number of unconventional, end-run tactics that they could use to force bondholders to agree to more favorable restructuring terms.Pagan said a Puerto Rican government-sponsored commission to audit the island‚Äôs debt should be allowed to complete its investigation. If the commission finds -- as Pagan and others expect -- that a significant percentage of Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt was issued illegally, the island‚Äôs government could choose to nullify that portion entirely.Manuel Natal, a member of Puerto Rico‚Äôs House of Representatives who serves on the commission and was one of the driving forces behind its creation, believes the island would be on strong legal footing to refuse payment of illegal debt. But he argues that it would likely not be necessary.‚ÄúIt is more of a negotiating strategy,‚Äù he said.Puerto Rico may also receive relief from the Supreme Court. The high court is expected to decide in late June whether to uphold a local Puerto Rican bankruptcy law that would allow Puerto Rico to seek court-mandated restructuring on $20 billion in debt owed by its municipalities and public corporations.That would presumably mean it could dispense with a sizable portion of its $70-billion debt burden without the need for new legislation.Sanders, for his part, called on the Federal Reserve to use ‚Äúits emergency authority to facilitate an orderly restructuring of Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt.‚Äù‚ÄúIf congressional legislation fails, we could see something like that,‚Äù LeCompte ventured.Experts on the Federal Reserve, however, say that the central bank does not have the legal authority to effectively bail out Puerto Rico.In the end, it comes down to timing. Without fast action ahead of the July 1 debt payment deadline, Puerto Rico's financial situation will crumble further, hurting its already-squeezed economy, health care and education systems.‚ÄúIt is critical that Congress pass this as there are very significant bond payments due in July,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on the sidelines of the G7 meetings in Japan on Friday morning. ‚ÄúIt is always significant when you reach bipartisan agreement on a difficult area, but this is one where time is of the essence.‚Äù"

Assuming your email address has remained constant all this time, you probably got a message like this earlier in the week:Discomfiting? You bet. While the passwords were encrypted -- an additional layer of security that essentially masks the characters -- hackers have ""cracked"" most of them, Motherboard's Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai reported on Wednesday. In other words, it's quite possible that your email and password are in the wrong hands right now.That's a big problem if you use the same password across websites. Think of it this way: If a hacker sees from the LinkedIn hack that your email address ends in @gmail.com, he or she might try logging into your inbox with the same password from the LinkedIn breach. If it works, all of your messages are now exposed, potentially including banking information or allowing access to other sites. To keep yourself safe, you'll want to immediately change any of your passwords that match the one you used on LinkedIn. Start with your email. The best practice is to use a unique password on every service -- to avoid this exact situation should hacks occur.You should also enable two-factor authentication on any sites that allow it. (LinkedIn does, for example.) Generally, this unfortunately named security feature will send a text message to your phone with a special passcode whenever someone (including yourself) tries to log into a service from an unrecognized device. A hacker might get your password, but they probably won't have your phone as well, which means they'll stay locked out.H/T BGR"

All four web-based platforms operate inside and outside of Syria, and focus on highlighting the daily struggles of Syrian women amid the conflict.Even in the alternative media that emerged at the beginning of the uprising, the role of women in the movement was minimized.

If passed, a bill to ban the practice, currently being reviewed by the country‚Äôs religious leaders and its cabinet, would mean parents could be prosecuted for circumcising their daughters.Ifrah Ahmed, who has battled serious opposition from conservative members of the community in her effort to push the issue to the top of the government agenda, says the bill would be a huge step for women‚Äôs rights in Somalia. While on a recent trip to London, she told Women and Girls Hub she‚Äôs hopeful the legislation could be passed as soon as the end of this year.Women and Girls Hub: How did you go from being a social activist in Ireland to advising the Somali government on FGM?Ifrah Ahmed: I was campaigning on FGM for the European Parliament when I met the former minister for women Khadijo Mohamed Dirie. She said I‚Äôd be the perfect person to work on this issue and invited me to work with her department to form a national strategy. I returned to Somalia in 2014 for the first time since fleeing as an asylum seeker aged 18 in 2006. I worked on several different social policies including child and sexual rights, but FGM was the one closest to my heart. It was very difficult to change people‚Äôs mentality in the beginning, but I felt I had come to Somalia for one reason and I had to complete my mission.Women and Girls Hub: How do you change people‚Äôs minds about an issue that is so deeply ingrained in society?Ifrah Ahmed: It was really hard. Old men would stand up and say, ‚ÄúGo back home!‚Äù They said I had become a Westerner and didn‚Äôt understand Somali society any more. I knew I could return to Europe and continue living my beautiful life but I wanted to stay and help these young girls. So I started talking to people in the community, asking them what they know about FGM. I asked them what benefit FGM had brought any woman they know. I tried to make them listen to my voice instead of complaining. In 2015 I was nominated for Humanitarian of the Year [at the Women4Africa Awards in London]. After that the president mentioned my name on International Women‚Äôs Day and that brought a lot of media attention to what I‚Äôve been trying to do. Now I am known as Ifrah FGM and people know this is the subject I always talk about!Women and Girls Hub: What was it like returning to Somalia after so many years living safely in Ireland?Ifrah Ahmed: It was really difficult moving back. Security is a big issue. Al-Shabaab targets anyone who has a relationship with the international community so I have to watch my every movement. I check who I am visiting and where I am going and I never go on public transport or spend time in a public place.Women and Girls Hub: You were a victim of FGM yourself. What do your family think about your campaign?Ifrah Ahmed: When I first started working on this, a friend wrote an article about me and the title of the article was ‚ÄúFGM campaigner returns to Somalia to question her granny.‚Äù When I got there my granny said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come near me, just ask me the question.‚Äù I was really embarrassed to ask her but after a few days I got the courage and said something. She said everyone did it at that time and no one knew any differently but she was glad I was doing something about it now. My hope was to film her talking about how she had changed her mind on FGM and show it to other grandmothers but unfortunately she passed away. It makes a big difference that she supported the work I am doing.Women and Girls Hub: What stage is the legislation at now?Ifrah Ahmed: The bill has been debated in the cabinet and is currently being discussed by religious leaders, but it has been delayed because some people want level one FGM (the least severe form of female circumcision) to be allowed. We want all forms of FGM to be banned so we are working on that now. Once it is agreed in cabinet it will be debated in parliament.Women and Girls Hub: What happens when the bill is passed?Ifrah Ahmed: For the government it‚Äôs all about celebrating passing legislation but this law will need to be followed up with a lot of grassroots work if it‚Äôs going to be effective. That‚Äôs why I have set up an organization in Somalia to work with communities on the issue. We will do a lot of educational work, talking to women and girls to inform them of their rights. I am also planning a big campaign called Dear Daughter. We will start with women living in the West who will pledge to their daughters they will not have to undergo FGM.

25,THE WORLDPOST,Former Refugee Fights For Her Dream To Abolish Female Genital Mutilation In Somalia,"Flora Bagenal, Women & Girls Hub",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/somalia-activist-abolish-female-genital-mutilation_us_573f6e8be4b00e09e89f1624,"Somalia could soon pass legislation that bans all forms of female genital mutilation (FGM), thanks in part to Ifrah Ahmed",2016-05-20,"People in Hargeysa, Somaliland, gather to discuss the practice of FGM. The bill to eradicate the practice in Somalia is currently being debated in Somalia's cabinet.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573f711e13000001053825a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Somalia could soon pass legislation that bans all forms of female genital mutilation (FGM), thanks in part to Ifrah Ahmed, a former refugee and Irish national who returned to Somalia to campaign for its eradication.Somalia has the highest rate of female genital mutilation in the world, with an estimated 95 percent of girls cut between the ages of four and 11. If passed, a bill to ban the practice, currently being reviewed by the country‚Äôs religious leaders and its cabinet, would mean parents could be prosecuted for circumcising their daughters.Ifrah Ahmed, who has battled serious opposition from conservative members of the community in her effort to push the issue to the top of the government agenda, says the bill would be a huge step for women‚Äôs rights in Somalia. While on a recent trip to London, she told Women and Girls Hub she‚Äôs hopeful the legislation could be passed as soon as the end of this year.Women and Girls Hub: How did you go from being a social activist in Ireland to advising the Somali government on FGM?Ifrah Ahmed: I was campaigning on FGM for the European Parliament when I met the former minister for women Khadijo Mohamed Dirie. She said I‚Äôd be the perfect person to work on this issue and invited me to work with her department to form a national strategy. I returned to Somalia in 2014 for the first time since fleeing as an asylum seeker aged 18 in 2006. I worked on several different social policies including child and sexual rights, but FGM was the one closest to my heart. It was very difficult to change people‚Äôs mentality in the beginning, but I felt I had come to Somalia for one reason and I had to complete my mission.Women and Girls Hub: How do you change people‚Äôs minds about an issue that is so deeply ingrained in society?Ifrah Ahmed: It was really hard. Old men would stand up and say, ‚ÄúGo back home!‚Äù They said I had become a Westerner and didn‚Äôt understand Somali society any more. I knew I could return to Europe and continue living my beautiful life but I wanted to stay and help these young girls. So I started talking to people in the community, asking them what they know about FGM. I asked them what benefit FGM had brought any woman they know. I tried to make them listen to my voice instead of complaining. In 2015 I was nominated for Humanitarian of the Year [at the Women4Africa Awards in London]. After that the president mentioned my name on International Women‚Äôs Day and that brought a lot of media attention to what I‚Äôve been trying to do. Now I am known as Ifrah FGM and people know this is the subject I always talk about!Women and Girls Hub: What was it like returning to Somalia after so many years living safely in Ireland?Ifrah Ahmed: It was really difficult moving back. Security is a big issue. Al-Shabaab targets anyone who has a relationship with the international community so I have to watch my every movement. I check who I am visiting and where I am going and I never go on public transport or spend time in a public place.Women and Girls Hub: You were a victim of FGM yourself. What do your family think about your campaign?Ifrah Ahmed: When I first started working on this, a friend wrote an article about me and the title of the article was ‚ÄúFGM campaigner returns to Somalia to question her granny.‚Äù When I got there my granny said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come near me, just ask me the question.‚Äù I was really embarrassed to ask her but after a few days I got the courage and said something. She said everyone did it at that time and no one knew any differently but she was glad I was doing something about it now. My hope was to film her talking about how she had changed her mind on FGM and show it to other grandmothers but unfortunately she passed away. It makes a big difference that she supported the work I am doing.Women and Girls Hub: What stage is the legislation at now?Ifrah Ahmed: The bill has been debated in the cabinet and is currently being discussed by religious leaders, but it has been delayed because some people want level one FGM (the least severe form of female circumcision) to be allowed. We want all forms of FGM to be banned so we are working on that now. Once it is agreed in cabinet it will be debated in parliament.Women and Girls Hub: What happens when the bill is passed?Ifrah Ahmed: For the government it‚Äôs all about celebrating passing legislation but this law will need to be followed up with a lot of grassroots work if it‚Äôs going to be effective. That‚Äôs why I have set up an organization in Somalia to work with communities on the issue. We will do a lot of educational work, talking to women and girls to inform them of their rights. I am also planning a big campaign called Dear Daughter. We will start with women living in the West who will pledge to their daughters they will not have to undergo FGM. I want them to say, ‚ÄúWhat happened to me, won‚Äôt happen to you.‚Äù We‚Äôre then hoping to take this campaign back to Somalia so they can see they can be part of a powerful movement to help eradicate the practice.Women and Girls Hub: Are you working on any other campaigns related to women?Ifrah Ahmed: Later this year Somalia will hold its first democratic elections in 25 years.

Their direct testimonials are vital in proving the extent of SGBV and, without such information, the possibility of holding the perpetrators accountable is an even more far-fetched notion.As with most displacement situations caused by conflict and crimes, forging the trust of the displaced individuals and communities is the most challenging part for human rights groups. Helping them understand the impact of every account in mobilizing protection for survivors and preventing such atrocities in future can be a long, uncertain process.Several groups, including the International Rescue Committee, Doctors Without Borders, advocacy groups and smaller, local NGOs, have continued to collect evidence, believing that there is indeed strength in numbers.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

The first one is to enhance our relationship with Inuktitut. We have the highest language retention [compared to other Indigenous groups in Canada], but language proficiency and use is on the decline.The second desire is to reclaim our culture. The assimilation policy of the Canadian government took the ‚ÄúIndigenous‚Äù out of our people and now there is an identity crisis.The third priority is suicide prevention. We have the highest suicide rate in Canada ‚Äì perhaps the world. At the youth summit, I asked: ‚ÄúPlease raise your hand if you have had suicidal thoughts, or have attempted suicide or have had someone close to you complete suicide.‚Äù And every single person put their hand up. We have a number of campaigns to celebrate life. Prevention is not just limited to mental health but includes reinstilling Inuit language and culture.The fourth priority is education and empowerment. We promote education and try to remove barriers to success. We teach our youth that leadership is not limited to politics. Inuk youth can share what empowers them on Instagram and in Nipiit, Canada‚Äôs Inuit youth magazine.Our last priority is reconciliation. It is in the interest of Inuit youth to become informed about the recent collective history of colonization of our peoples. Since I was elected, we have entrenched Inuit history in our summit, so that Inuit youth can have that conversation, digest it, critically analyze it and begin the healing process of intergenerational trauma. Reconciliation is the responsibility of each Canadian, but we work together to ensure we all support one another.Arctic Deeply: How does your position as president inform your life?Maatalii Okalik: I try to lead by example. Language revitalization is a priority in my own life, and I balance my post-secondary education with Inuk-specific ways of knowing. I learn about our environment, spend time hunting and fishing and thriving off of our homeland. I am making a pair of Kamik [seal-skin boots] right now. I do my very best to practice reconciliation by creating awareness and making a conscious choice to stop negative cycles and promote healthy ones.Arctic Deeply: What are some of the barriers you face as Inuit youth in achieving these priorities?Maatalii Okalik: There‚Äôs a lack of capacity to be able to implement them. Secure funding is a huge barrier. A lot of energy and time goes into writing [grants] for very small funds that only last for a small period of time.

After news that the ""Blow"" singer's performance at the Billboard Music Awards had been canceled after Lukasz ""Dr. Luke"" Gottwald's label, Kemosabe, rescinded its approval, Gaga spoke up on Twitter. The ""Born This Way"" singer compared Gottwald to Disney's underwater villain Ursula, who took away Ariel's voice in ""The Little Mermaid."" Gottwald and his label reportedly pulled the plug on Kesha's performance for fear that she might make a statement about him at the show; a report by TMZ last week claimed Kesha was going to reference the legal battle on stage. However, Kesha refuted those claims, assuring her fans that she was planning on singing a cover of Bob Dylan's ""It Ain't Me, Babe."" In a statement released by dick clark productions on Tuesday, the organization said: Kesha accepted an invitation to perform on the show and she received written approval from Dr. Luke‚Äôs record label, Kemosabe Records. Kemosabe subsequently rescinded its approval following a media report on Wednesday May 11 regarding Kesha‚Äôs appearance on the BBMAs. Unfortunately, Kesha and Kemosabe have since been unable to come to an agreement for Kesha to perform on the show.Kesha's mom, Pebe Sebert, also spoke out about the canceled performance with a series of tweets Wednesday afternoon. ""Does Kesha have the right to pursue her happiness? Or did they only mean that for rich men? Do you think that there is one male singer who could ever be 'not allowed to sing' on the Billboard Awards by another man???"" she asked, adding, ""How much more public abuse does my daughter have to take before someone says 'Enough is enough'!""

Of these prescriptions, 60 percent were for opioids such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, according to the results from the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health.Half of the parents reported that their children had leftover medication from the prescription, according to the poll. ""We found that the amount of pain medication prescribed for children is frequently greater than the amount used, and too few parents recall clear direction from their provider about what to do with leftover medication,"" Dr. Matthew Davis, a professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan and the director of the poll, said in a statement.The researchers found that 47 percent of the parents kept the extra pills at home, 30 percent disposed of the extra pills in the trash or toilet, 8 percent returned the extra pills to their doctor or pharmacy, 6 percent used the mediation for other family members, and 9 percent did not remember what they did with the extra medication. (Returning pills to the doctor's office or pharmacy, or disposing of them safely in the trash are recommended.)In addition, the pollsters found that parents whose health care providers had discussed how to dispose of leftover medication were more likely to dispose of the medications properly. However, only one-third of parents reported receiving such instructions, the poll found.""This is a missed opportunity to prevent prescription drug misuse among children,"" Davis said. Indeed, ""for adolescents, a known point of access to narcotic pain medication is leftover pills from a prior prescription,"" he said. The poll suggests that doctors need to do a better job of explaining this risk to parents, he added.Nearly 2,000 parents participated in the national poll; all had at least one child, ages 5 to 17. The findings were published today (May 16).Follow Sara G. Miller on Twitter @saragmiller. Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+. Originally published on Live Science."

Luxembourg and Amazon had no immediate comment.Amazon overhauled its European tax practices in May last year allowing it to book sales and pay taxes in Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy instead of channeling all sales through Luxembourg. The move could raise its tax bill.Multinational firms face increasing public scrutiny of their tax affairs following popular outrage at revelations of complex offshore schemes to minimize payments. The European Commission, led by former Luxembourg premier Jean-Claude Juncker, has pledged to make rules more transparent across the EU.The EU's crackdown on so-called sweetheart deals involving U.S. firms has been criticized by U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew who in February demanded that European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager reconsider such probes because they created disturbing precedents.This would be the fourth ruling by the EU competition enforcer following an order in October last year to Luxembourg to claw back up to 30 million euros from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  and a similar order to the Dutch tax authorities related to Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).The Commission in January told Belgium to recover around 700 million euros from 35 companies including Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), BP (BP.L) and BASF (BASFn.DE) because of their participation in an illegal tax scheme.Other outstanding similar cases are Commission probes of whether Apple (AAPL.O) paid too little tax in Ireland and burger chain McDonald's too little in Luxembourg.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)"

Davis, who resigned from Dean Food's board in August, pleaded guilty on Monday.Both men were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. Davis was also charged with perjury and obstruction of justice.Barry Berke, Walters' lawyer, said the allegations were ""based on erroneous assumptions, speculative theories and false finger-pointing.""Mickelson's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Thomas Melsheimer, Davis's lawyer, said his client was ""pleased to be cooperating with the government in its investigation.""From 2008 to 2014 Walters obtained inside information from Davis, and used it to make $32 million in profits and avoid another $11 million in trading losses, according to an indictment.Davis disclosed information to Walters about Dean Foods' financial outlook, earnings, and its spinoff of WhiteWaves Food Co. The deal sent the company's shares soaring after it was announced on Aug. 8, 2012, according to the indictment.Walters also obtained insider information about Darden Restaurants Inc  from Davis who was sought by an unnamed investment firm in New York as an investor or director, according to the indictment.The two men have been friends since the mid-1990s, based on shared interests in sports, golf, gambling and business, according to court papers.The probe conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission became public in 2014 amid news reports also linking the investigation to activist investor Carl Icahn.Investigators had examined whether Icahn passed inside information about Clorox Co  to Walters, sources have told Reuters. It was unclear if that aspect of the probe remains active.Icahn acknowledged last year he had a business relationship with Walters but said he never provided inside information to anyone.The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are U.S. v.

The FBI arrested Walters in Las Vegas on Wednesday, The New York Times' Matthew Goldstein and Ben Protess reported.It‚Äôs alleged that Davis fed Walters details about Dean Foods' business and plans in exchange for almost $100,000 and repayment of a $350,000 debt. The SEC put the total amount Walters made from Davis‚Äô tips, plus losses he was able to avoid, at $40 million. Walters and Davis are alleged to have shared information between 2008 and 2012. Mickelson was roped into the situation in 2012, the SEC says, when Walters called him about a gambling debt the golfer owed him. During the call, Walters allegedly told Mickelson to buy Dean Foods stock, which Mickelson did. When Dean Foods announced quarterly earnings and a spin-off plan about a week later, the stock jumped 40 percent and Mickelson made $931,000, according to the SEC complaint.Mickelson faces no criminal charges.

41,STYLE,How BaubleBar's Founders Made Jewelry Affordable For Shoppers Everywhere,Michelle Persad,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baublebar-founders_us_573cbdfde4b0aee7b8e8c496,Because we all need something that sparkles.,2016-05-19,BaubleBar co-founders Daniella Yacobovsky (l) and Amy Jain (r).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573cca5d13000001053821c0.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When most of us have a problem, we complain about it. But when Daniella Yacobovsky and Amy Jain had a problem, they created a company to help solve it.The duo met while working in investment banking, attended Harvard Business School together and went on to create the wildly successful company BaubleBar. The company was founded in 2011 and sells on-trend, affordable costume jewelry, direct-to-consumer -- something that Yacobovsky and Jain noticed was lacking in the market. While BaubleBar doesn't disclose revenue, sales were estimated to be in the $75 million range in 2015 -- so you could say these women know what they're doing. We were lucky enough to sit down with the founders and picked their brains about what they look for when hiring, why they've stayed out of the limelight and what they think of all the naysayers. Here's what we learned:The problem they saw and how they solved it:Daniella Yacobovsky: Amy and I had been best friends for a really long time. We were at business school and we used to work in finance. And we had this habit where we would go shopping for shoes to reward ourselves because we were working long hours and we hated our jobs. So we were shopping for shoes one day and we just started having this really organic conversation about how we were naturally the ideal customer for this category, we love jewelry, but we would never go down to the first floor of Saks and spend $350 on some of the necklaces that they were selling. So it started this whole conversation about our own purchasing patterns as consumers who love the product. We wanted great design, great trends and great quality, but at the right value. This is a product that, it's not a pair of shoes, we're not wearing it everyday through the season. We wanted to mix it up and change it up really, really frequently. It was product that we were buying to try a new trend. It was product that we were buying to refresh our wardrobes, to go from work to a night out and [we] felt that no one was really nailing it in the category in terms of delivering that mix of design and quality. Why they have intentionally stayed behind the scenes:Amy Jain: I think it's two things. One, I think it's our personalities. The two of us are the type that want to be in the trenches with our team, building with them every single day. We said early on that we want to put our heads down for two years and wake up and hopefully when we do, we hear from people, ""Oh my god, you work at BaubleBar, I love that company."" And when we hear that, we're like, ""How did you even hear about us because we've been at desks for the last couple of years?"" I think the other thing is, we want this brand to be all about BaubleBar -- it's not about Amy and Daniella, it's not about the two of us. We're here in the background. Our job is to build a great team and really think about delivering that amazing customer experience.DY: And I think one of the thing's that's really important about BaubleBar and that really differentiates us as a brand is, we aim to bring her access to amazing fashion and we are not niche in terms of our style. We are not feminine or edgy or boho -- we are really about finding your personal style through accessories and through the extra pieces. And I think that when you have one person that is the face of [your brand], you really are -- and this works for a lot of brands -- you really are putting a stake in the ground and saying, ""This is the exact personification of who we are."" We really shy away from that because I think something that's so core to who we are as a brand, is we want our girl to come to the site and feel like she can put together the pieces that feel like her personal style. Whether they think direct-to-consumer is the way forward for retail:DY: You know it's hard to say. I think there are costs and benefits to both. With direct-to-consumer you can potentially cut out the middleman and improve costs for your customers, but then you bear the costs of driving awareness and excitement about your brand and driving traffic to your website, which is a very, very, very difficult proposition. When we were starting, we were coming onto the marketplace at a time when digital marketing was not as competitive or as expensive as it is today. E-mail was a far more viable channel and social media was really getting big. I mean if you think about Instagram five years ago, where we are today has completely changed. So all of those tools and all of those things that we had access to, we were at a special moment where we really were able to build up a strong base and awareness for our brand and I think that's getting harder and harder to do today.What they look for when they're hiring:DY: From a skill-set perspective of course it depends on the role. In terms of the things that we always look for, I think there is some element of scrappiness and hunger... that's something that is very hard to interview for, but really makes a difference. Even though we aren't a startup anymore, we're not a grown-up company either -- we're in this toddler, adolescent phase. The things that were really moving the needle for us when we were younger, when we were 10 people sitting in the middle of the room and people were comfortable standing up and shouting out ideas or putting forth a suggestion that, at the time, felt really revolutionary and groundbreaking, we want people to continue to feel that comfort level and not feel like oh well, I'm an associate, I'm a coordinator so I can't really speak up and share my voice or share my opinion.What makes an employee shine:AJ: We love team members that are very self-sufficient. During the interview, we ask; ""This is a challenge that the business is seeing, what would you do?"" And the question is adapted by team. I had an interview one day where the girl said, ""I would write down all my questions and I would think about them and I would do x,y and z research and then I would come to you and ask, you what to do next?"" And I was like, no, no, you don't understand, I'm asking you what to do because I have no idea. We really want partners that are going to help us figure out solutions and figure out answers, to Daniella's point, in a scrappy way. And scrappy for a start-up is resource light, bandwidth tight, dollar light -- so we love team members who are ready to roll up their sleeves, get in there and help us figure it out. The one piece of advice they would give their younger selves:DY: I think my one piece of advice is that every single day is a total and complete roller coaster and to not be alarmed by the swing. We always joke, everyday you get the best news and the worst news you've ever gotten in the company. And I think when you're not used to that and you're used to a very consistent job or career, that initially is very jarring. It took us a little while, but now, I always joke with Amy -- if the building was on fire, everyone would be running from the building and we'd turn to each other and go,""Meh, someone will put it out."" It's an exaggerated example, but you really have to learn how to just deal with that and I feel like now, I really apply that to every piece of my life, even my personal life.AJ: I think the other thing we'd say is, a lot of people will tell you you can't do it. I think our advice to our old selves would just be, listen as much as you can, but trust your gut and trust your instincts because there are going to be a ton of naysayers but you can really come out the other side with something great.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

But after that, Ginsburg wrote, the right ""detaches upon conviction.""""It would be an unjustified windfall, in most cases, to remedy sentencing delay by vacating validly obtained convictions,"" she wrote, implying that once you're guilty, you're guilty.Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote separately to note that states may have laws and procedures to allow defendants some relief if their sentencing is taking unusually long. That came with a rebuff of the man at the center of Thursday's ruling.""And a person who sleeps on these remedies, as Betterman did, may simply have no right to complain that his sentencing was delayed,"" Thomas wrote. It turns out Montana does have statutes to that effect, though their efficiency is unclear.Justice Sonia Sotomayor also wrote separately to emphasize, as Ginsburg did, that people who sit around waiting for their sentence may have ""other recourse"" under the Constitution's right to due process.But as the Supreme Court often does, she noted ""the question is an open one"" and should be left for another day in ""an appropriate case"" -- perhaps that of another hapless individual like Betterman."
43,COLLEGE,Designing Ways To Move Beyond Diversity On Campus,"The Hechinger Report, Kathleen Lucadamo",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moving-beyond-diversity-on-campus_us_573b7e3de4b0ef86171c64a2,How a liberal arts college attracted students from all walks of life -- and decided that wasn‚Äôt enough.,2016-05-19,Students zip around campus with few places to anchor them to the landscape. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573b81b91a00003000c28b8f.jpeg?ops=crop_0_112_2448_2490%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"GRANVILLE, Ohio ‚Äî When Laurel Kennedy, a communications professor, arrived at Denison University more than 25 years ago, she remembered seeing a sea of white, blond-haired students. ‚ÄúNow there is much more diversity in every way,‚Äù said Kennedy. ‚ÄúNow we have students with blue hair.‚ÄùThe college now has more students from various racial, ethnic and family-income backgrounds, too. But after working hard to create a more diverse campus, reflective of the world beyond college, Denison recently decided that its diversity would be as cosmetic as blue hair if students didn‚Äôt experience it by interacting with each other.‚ÄúThe best decisions are made by diverse teams of people,‚Äù said Denison President Adam Weinberg. ‚ÄúHow do we move from a place that has become diverse to a place that really embraces diversity as a core value and as a community strength?‚ÄùTo motivate students to engage with those different from them, school leaders are looking at everything from the way they fund activity groups to the size of party venues to the physical layout of the campus.‚ÄúCultural change always lags behind demographic change,‚Äù said Kennedy, who is now vice president of student development. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs harder to change the culture than it is to change the composition of the student body.‚ÄùDenison has just over 2,000 students. The school began pushing to increase its diversity 15 years ago, offering more loans and doing outreach to urban high schools. According to school administrators, in 2005-06, 16 percent of the student body was considered multicultural, which Denison defines as African-American, Native American, Asian-American, Hispanic, multiracial or international. By 2014-15, 32 percent was multicultural. Similarly, in 2005 there were 257 recipients of Pell Grants, the federal grants that go to low-income families. That number rose to 444 in 2014-15.Two years ago, administrators created a $5,000 pool to encourage different groups to work together. Called the Fund for Campus Innovation and Action, it provides students up to $500 per project to execute ideas that will better integrate students and foster communication between all groups. For instance, one proposal from a student was to make dinner for guests from different groups, the goal being to get a variety of students to share a table and bread. The money was for groceries.A group of athletes, the Diversity and Inclusion Athletic Advisory Group, received money to create cards to be distributed on campus, on which 10 athletes wrote about words they would never use. One card, featuring a picture of a female swimmer, read, ‚ÄúSaying ‚ÄòOreo‚Äô insists that I act in accord with racial stereotypes. I don‚Äôt.‚Äù Another card, with a picture of two golfers, male and female, read, ‚ÄúTransphobia is harmful, so we embrace all gender identities.‚Äù[Related: The rich-poor divide on America‚Äôs college campuses is getting wider, fast]The school also provided funding for a monthly story slam at the campus coffee house. One theme asked students to describe their first love. ‚ÄúIt gave us a lens into someone else‚Äôs experience, which builds empathy,‚Äù said Haley Wells Jones, a junior who organized the event.Not all projects got the green light: A proposal to start a small band to boost school spirit was rejected.At the same time, student government, which has a hefty budget for student activities of nearly $900,000 (a lot of the money goes to guest speakers), changed the way it funded groups, giving priority to those that co-host events with other, different groups. For instance, the Black Student Union hosted an event with an LGBT group.Administrators also began looking at physical and architectural ideas. ‚ÄúBringing students together in all kinds of spaces feels really important,‚Äù said Kennedy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs this really interesting question of how can you design space so that you encourage and facilitate interactions across lines of difference? What would that space look like?‚ÄùDenison has an aesthetically beautiful campus with plenty of green space ‚Äî it covers 900 acres, more than half of which is a biological reserve, and was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Pedestrian paths link the buildings, amid thick oak and elm trees and well-manicured lawns. Yet students zip around, rarely stopping to sit and soak in the possibility of a chance encounter with classmates. The flagpole outside the student union, which faculty and students agree is the campus gathering point, has benches about 20 feet across from each other, meaning students would have to shout to converse.Weinberg, whose academic background is in sociology, has organized a team that is looking to alter the landscape to encourage student interaction through steps such as adding moveable seating (like Adirondack chairs or beanbags) and installing artworks.In addition, many students told Weinberg that it was a challenge to include several groups at a party because most of the school‚Äôs recreational facilities can only accommodate about 40 students at a time.

44,COLLEGE,Designing Ways To Move Beyond Diversity On Campus,"The Hechinger Report, Kathleen Lucadamo",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moving-beyond-diversity-on-campus_us_573b7e3de4b0ef86171c64a2,How a liberal arts college attracted students from all walks of life -- and decided that wasn‚Äôt enough.,2016-05-19,Brian Allen talks about his experience as a gay man on the swim team.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573b8208130000d605381e48.jpeg?cache=q2zBKAwYYr&ops=crop_187_382_2261_2583%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"GRANVILLE, Ohio ‚Äî When Laurel Kennedy, a communications professor, arrived at Denison University more than 25 years ago, she remembered seeing a sea of white, blond-haired students. ‚ÄúNow there is much more diversity in every way,‚Äù said Kennedy. ‚ÄúNow we have students with blue hair.‚ÄùThe college now has more students from various racial, ethnic and family-income backgrounds, too. But after working hard to create a more diverse campus, reflective of the world beyond college, Denison recently decided that its diversity would be as cosmetic as blue hair if students didn‚Äôt experience it by interacting with each other.‚ÄúThe best decisions are made by diverse teams of people,‚Äù said Denison President Adam Weinberg. ‚ÄúHow do we move from a place that has become diverse to a place that really embraces diversity as a core value and as a community strength?‚ÄùTo motivate students to engage with those different from them, school leaders are looking at everything from the way they fund activity groups to the size of party venues to the physical layout of the campus.‚ÄúCultural change always lags behind demographic change,‚Äù said Kennedy, who is now vice president of student development. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs harder to change the culture than it is to change the composition of the student body.‚ÄùDenison has just over 2,000 students. The school began pushing to increase its diversity 15 years ago, offering more loans and doing outreach to urban high schools. According to school administrators, in 2005-06, 16 percent of the student body was considered multicultural, which Denison defines as African-American, Native American, Asian-American, Hispanic, multiracial or international. By 2014-15, 32 percent was multicultural. Similarly, in 2005 there were 257 recipients of Pell Grants, the federal grants that go to low-income families. That number rose to 444 in 2014-15.Two years ago, administrators created a $5,000 pool to encourage different groups to work together. Called the Fund for Campus Innovation and Action, it provides students up to $500 per project to execute ideas that will better integrate students and foster communication between all groups. For instance, one proposal from a student was to make dinner for guests from different groups, the goal being to get a variety of students to share a table and bread. The money was for groceries.A group of athletes, the Diversity and Inclusion Athletic Advisory Group, received money to create cards to be distributed on campus, on which 10 athletes wrote about words they would never use. One card, featuring a picture of a female swimmer, read, ‚ÄúSaying ‚ÄòOreo‚Äô insists that I act in accord with racial stereotypes. I don‚Äôt.‚Äù Another card, with a picture of two golfers, male and female, read, ‚ÄúTransphobia is harmful, so we embrace all gender identities.‚Äù[Related: The rich-poor divide on America‚Äôs college campuses is getting wider, fast]The school also provided funding for a monthly story slam at the campus coffee house. One theme asked students to describe their first love. ‚ÄúIt gave us a lens into someone else‚Äôs experience, which builds empathy,‚Äù said Haley Wells Jones, a junior who organized the event.Not all projects got the green light: A proposal to start a small band to boost school spirit was rejected.At the same time, student government, which has a hefty budget for student activities of nearly $900,000 (a lot of the money goes to guest speakers), changed the way it funded groups, giving priority to those that co-host events with other, different groups. For instance, the Black Student Union hosted an event with an LGBT group.Administrators also began looking at physical and architectural ideas. ‚ÄúBringing students together in all kinds of spaces feels really important,‚Äù said Kennedy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs this really interesting question of how can you design space so that you encourage and facilitate interactions across lines of difference? What would that space look like?‚ÄùDenison has an aesthetically beautiful campus with plenty of green space ‚Äî it covers 900 acres, more than half of which is a biological reserve, and was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Pedestrian paths link the buildings, amid thick oak and elm trees and well-manicured lawns. Yet students zip around, rarely stopping to sit and soak in the possibility of a chance encounter with classmates. The flagpole outside the student union, which faculty and students agree is the campus gathering point, has benches about 20 feet across from each other, meaning students would have to shout to converse.Weinberg, whose academic background is in sociology, has organized a team that is looking to alter the landscape to encourage student interaction through steps such as adding moveable seating (like Adirondack chairs or beanbags) and installing artworks.In addition, many students told Weinberg that it was a challenge to include several groups at a party because most of the school‚Äôs recreational facilities can only accommodate about 40 students at a time. As a result, he said, the school is considering adding a barn to campus where students could hold events like dances for 100 or more students.[Related: How one top college bucked a trend to take more poor and nonwhite applicants]When Weinberg became president three years ago, he was surprised by the range of Denison‚Äôs diversity, saying that the students represent a mix of races, ethnicities, classes, political beliefs and religions. ‚ÄúI saw lots of challenges, but I also saw real opportunity,‚Äù he said.The size of the campus, he added, makes cultural integration doable: ‚ÄúAt a large state school, you can avoid people different from yourself.

The Open is one of the world's great sporting events and going forward we will not stage the Championship at a venue that does not admit women as members.""Royal Troon, which hosts this year's tournament in July, is now the only Open venue not to permit women members. But the Royal and Ancient Golf Club - which used to run the Open until the R&A was split off from the club in 2004 - only admitted its first women members last year.Muirfield, close to Edinburgh, is controlled by the Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers and has retained a male-only membership policy since it was founded in 1744.The R&A said Muirfield could be considered again if the membership policy is brought into line with other Open courses.""If the policy at the club should change we would reconsider Muirfield as a venue for The Open in future,"" it said.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon supported the R&A's stance on Muirfield.""Scotland has women leaders in every walk of life. It is 2016. This is simply indefensible,"" she said on Twitter.(Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Larry King)"
