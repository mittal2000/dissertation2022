0,ARTS & CULTURE,Bo Bartlett: The Intermediary,"John Seed, ContributorProfessor of Art History",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bo-bartlett-the-intermediary_us_5761b3a2e4b07d4d0a419b2d,This personal interest in bridging gaps—of being an intermediary—is the main motivation behind Bartlett’s recent Lacunae,2016-06-18,"Bo Bartlett, <em>God</em>, 1990, Oil on Linen, 120 x 168",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576545011500002d0073b457.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In early 1991, art critic Roberta Smith looked over Bo Bartlett’s painting God—a sweeping image of a black man, poised in front of a sweeping coastal horizon, wrapped in a quilt—and came slightly unglued. In her New York Times review of the exhibition she later wrote of the piece: “As consciousness raising, this is fairly simple-minded. As history painting, it's idiotic.”In the same column, Smith also dinged Bartlett for his “conservative” artistic style (realism), and dismissed his paintings as being “more trendy than timeless.” Smith’s comments, which generated a domino effect of subsequent negative reviews—by Peter Schjeldahl, Michael Kimmelman and others—re-shaped the arc of Bartlett’s career.“The review was devastating for me,” Bartlett reflects: “Some sales dropped away: two reviews and an article in a major art magazine strangely evaporated. I withdrew into myself more and painted exactly what I wanted to paint more and essentially said: ‘F-all y'all.’""In the years that followed, his close friendship with Andrew Wyeth— a mentor figure that encouraged Bartlett to persevere—and his personal commitment to authenticity helped form the “thicker skin” that protected him as he re-booted his career. Over the long haul, Smith’s three paragraphs had the effect of turning Bartlett further inward, something he has come to value.“In some ways I'm grateful to Roberta Smith for the review,” Bartlett says now, twenty-five years later. “I had the opportunity to mention this to Roberta a couple of summers ago when we met in Maine. I don't think she even remembered writing the review, and when I reminded her of its contents—i.e. ‘idiotic’—she said, ‘that's a horrible thing to say.’” It was, but as Bartlett well understands: “We believe what we read in the New York Times.”Bartlett isn’t the only notable realist painter to be treated like a fly and swatted off the coffee table book of ART by east coast critics in the past few decades, but it was still a pretty lonely situation. Fortunately, the more atomized art world of 2016 supports and celebrates a broader range of tastes. Traditional critics and downsized newspapers now hold less influence and the fast-evolving blogosphere supports affinity groups for every kind of art. In the now thriving circle of Contemporary Realism (a necessarily vague title for a set of approaches too varied to name) Bartlett looks more and more prescient: a model of commitment who took some knocks, kept his head down and stayed true to his inner vision.“I was in the thrall of Bo Bartlett the first time I saw his work at the New York Academy of Art,” says artist Graydon Parrish. “From then on, when I need a sabbatical from the machinations of the Art World, I seek out Bartlett's world to reset my soul.” What Bartlett’s early detractors likely missed—and still often miss—is that his work functions without the slightest trace of fashionable irony: he and his art are of one piece. Bartlett is earnest—sometimes painfully so—and that has created its share of misunderstandings, possibly including Roberta Smith’s sharp reaction to his work.Being earnest—a lingering art world taboo—is part of what makes Bartlett “different,” especially because the content of his work deals with American culture, which he sees as suitable for mythologizing, straight-up, including its deeply embedded optimism. Like his mentor Andrew Wyeth, Bartlett is a realist-savant, a kind of medium who let’s his material come through into paintings that look real, but which are in some respects waking dreams.Yes, Bartlett has been influenced by American realists—including Eakins, Wyeth and Homer—but his work also shares hints of the dreamlike solemnity found in the works of the European masters Balthus and Dali. Bartlett’s best paintings are trapdoors that lead from perceived experience into the mystical, the mythological and the enigmatic. He is an artist-as-intermediary who serves as a guide and then walks away to let you feel the magic—if you can—to the point that you can be present enough to enter and empathize with his characters and their situations.For example, Bartlett’s Heartland series includes a painting of a gun-toting young hunter and his love leaning on a Chevy pickup, which displays a newly shot deer on its roof. In the foreground a boy holds a stick that aspires to be a rifle. Just how does Bartlett feel about this trio and how does he want you to feel? If he has opened the scene up enough so that you can “enter” it without judgment, you are on the right track. Bartlett’s canvases are vignettes from an ever-evolving quilt of America and American-ness. His life project is to be an agent of positive change; to try and keep the American fabric whole by making its realities evanesce and coalesce into fresh myths.A politically progressive painter born and raised in a conservative southern state (Georgia), Bartlett has always believed in the power of art to ameliorate differences and unify opposing ideas. To see it otherwise is to feign sophistication as a cover for cynicism: I believe in the power of Art to transform lives. My hope is to find connective tissue between opposing ideas to try to help find common ground, to show that we are all in this together. If we can move beyond the cynicism, the dualistic thinking, all the rhetoric and posturing, if we can listen to others, reach out and find the things we have in common with others we'll start to resolve some of these conflicts that appear irreconcilable. I've seen Republicans and Democrats, the wealthy and the homeless, people of all races and genders, standing shoulder-to-shoulder appreciating the wonder of a work of Art.This personal interest in bridging gaps—of being an intermediary—is the main motivation behind Bartlett’s recent Lacunae Series, which will be on view at Ameringer | McEnery | Yohe Gallery between July 7 and August 12. The paintings in this group address the lacunae (gaps) between established religions and modern, secular worlds. Their imagery, which Bartlett describes as “mashed-up,” was inspired by both historical contexts and religious traditions.I recently interviewed Bo Bartlett and asked him about some of the themes, ideas and images in his recent work. John Seed Interviews Bo BartlettJS: What are the Lacunae paintings about? BB: The Lacunae address pertinent issues of importance in the culture wars. The other paintings with similarly paired themes are Galilee, The Samaritans, Christmas, The American, Halloween, The Promised Land and Oligarchy. JS: Can you walk me through one of the paintings? Tell me about Easter...BB: In Easter (also titled Easter Egg Hunt in the Cemetery of the Confederate Dead), the Christian story of the resurrection is mashed-up with the Southern phrase ""We will rise again."" Living in the South, both of these points of view are still alive and well. Healthy fodder should come from our surroundings. The Cemetery of the Confederate Dead is beside my studio. A Dixie flag flies over the rows of white grave markers. BB: The painting unfolded during the ongoing battle about Southern State Houses flying the Confederate flag. Sen.Alfred Iverson is famous for his memorable post-war cry ""We Will Rise Again."" Iverson is buried in the cemetery. His son was a debonaire General who was largely responsible for Southern troops losing the battles of Antietum, Gettysburg and he was in charge of troops when Sherman drove through Georgia to the sea. JS: Tell me about OligarchyBB: Oligarchy started with the subtitle The Sadducces. The Sadducees and Pharisees were the ruling elite in Palestine in the 1st Century BC and AD. They were often the ire of Jesus' teachings. The Sadducees were in charge of political and religious affairs. They maintained relations with Rome and were in charge of military affairs. JS: Was there an individual or incident that inspired this painting? BB: One time, in the early 1990's when I was painting a portrait of Ambassador Walter Annenberg (I used to paint a lot of portraits in Pennsylvania when I was younger), I was painting him in his office, a red phone behind his desk rang and he informed me that he had to stop posing for a minute and take this call. He spoke in hushed tones, saying, ""No, don't do that"" and ""Yes, do that.""Hanging up the phone and turning back around he informed me that he was advising the President. I asked him about his politics, did he support Republicans or Democrats, he quickly waved his hand back and forth saying ""Republicans Democrats apples oranges, that's not where the power is!"" And I realized in moment that there is a ""They"" and that I was in the presence of one. JS: So the painting is about a very specific group of individuals...BB: The Oligarchy today is the corporate elite.. Those who profit at the expense of others.. The one percent.. The painting took a couple of years of planning and another year to complete. I did drawings and paintings and studies of the primary characters. My friend, a doctor from my hometown of Columbus Georgia agreed to pose for the King. Students from Columbus State University College of the Arts posed for the crowd of figures below. I want it to feel like we aren't certain if they are holding him up saying ""long live the King"" or if they are carrying him over the ridge chanting ""Off with his head"" to throw him off the cliff. JS: Is there more context? What about the figures who surround the Oligarch?BB: Ferguson erupted while I was working on the painting. The Black Lives Matter movement informed the mood, but I didn't want the painting to represent one particular revolt. The struggles are eternal. The power struggle is eternal.There are right and wrong sides of history. When we realize that protecting our status can hold us back and create a kind of dead document of our lives then we will live not just for ourselves but also for the well-being of others, the other, those who we share this planet with. We live in a holistic system, everything effects everything else. What I do affects you, what you do effects me. Race, class, gender, these are issues of the day.The haves and the have-nots, the 1% and the 99%. I'm not moralizing. The work isn't didactic. It's not ""history painting"" in that sort of way. It is just presenting the situation. The protagonists share the stage. JS: Is it fair to say that there is a new ""darkness"" in this work: a new sense of complaint? BB: I'm not ""anti"" and I'm not a ""stick it to the man"" complainer. I believe in working with what's there, not tearing it all down. Perhaps you can see that in the choices in my Art.I use convention. I welcome cliche as readily as I welcome original thought. Low and high. Populist and esoteric. It's all good. I want to build upon what's come before, history is a cornerstone, our foundation. Evolution is incremental, not biological evolution, but psychological evolution. The only way to evolve is through understanding the big picture. Understanding the other. Through Empathy. Art engenders empathy. It can transform us. Art is freedom, real freedom. JS: What motivates you as an artist? BB: Since reading Suzi Gablik's The Re-Enchantment of Art in the early 90's I have grappled with how to meld the challenges she put forth with a sustained artistic practice. I have continued to paint. But my practice has expanded to include teaching school children, working with the homeless, teaching them to paint to express themselves, to tell their stories. Joseph Campbell said ""the artists are the prophets"", if that is true, we all have to work harder to be agents of change; to make the world a better place.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575ca34a1500002b0073a0bb.jpeg?cache=9g6dGQqDP7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court's historic 2015 ruling made it legal for same-sex couples to marry in all 50 states, and those planning to tie the knot are now choosing to adhere to wedding traditions and rituals long embraced by their heterosexual counterparts. The 2016 Survey of Contemporary Couples & Current Wedding Trends found that 79 percent of same-sex couples are now celebrating their unions with a formal ceremony and reception with invited guests. That figure represents a 36 percent increase since 2013.These days, those weddings are definitely family affairs, too. Sixty percent of those polled said that they received emotional support from their parents, which is up from 46 percent three years ago. Meanwhile, 77 percent of same-sex couples are choosing to tie the knot in their home states, because they no longer need to travel to neighboring states (or elsewhere) to have their marriage recognized. A collaborative effort between WeddingWire, Inc., Community Marketing & Insights (CMI), GayWeddings and the Gay Wedding Institute, the survey polled a total of 1,436 respondents, 852 of which self-identified as LGBTQ, in an effort to be reflective of the wedding industry as a whole.“Because the legal landscape has shifted so quickly in the U.S., gay wedding trends revealed as few as four years ago are no longer able to be generalized to today’s same-sex couples,"" Kathryn Hamm, GayWeddings' publisher, said in a press release. ""Understanding the real story of what’s happening in the wedding market requires the comprehensive, nuanced, and comparison-based look included in this report.”Of course, as same-sex weddings have gotten more elaborate, the amount that couples are choosing to spend on those celebrations has surged, too. These days, the average same-sex couple spends $11,000 on their wedding, according to the survey. Although that's $4,000 less than the average heterosexual couple spends, it's an 88 percent increase since 2013. The majority of same-sex couples (74 percent) are covering those costs on their own.

The fungus is relatively rare, but flourishes in the high altitudes and low temperatures of the Tibetan Plateau.The fungus has been popular for centuries as a traditional cure for ailments ranging from asthma to impotence. But demand has skyrocketed as China’s middle class expands, says Getty photojournalist Kevin Frayer. “The insatiable demand in the last decade for use in Chinese medicine has driven the prices to a point where good quality fungus can be worth more than their weight in gold,” Frayer told The WorldPost in an email.Frayer, who is documenting the lives of nomadic Tibetan communities for an ongoing project, said everyone he met kept talking about the annual harvest, so he went along last month.“The mountains of Tibet are vast and many of the places the cordyceps fungus are harvested from are quite remote ... so you need to trek in and climb to access the areas,” he said. “The landscape is incredible and exceptionally beautiful but the terrain is also hard and unforgiving.”The harvest usually lasts one month in May and June, and has become a major part of the region’s economy.Many Tibetan nomads have given up on traditional trades in favor of the annual caterpillar fungus “gold rush,” Frayer explained.“For millennia they have been yak and livestock herders living off the land, but now more and more people are relying on the fungus to pay their bills,” he said. “The harvest gives these communities [a] chance to make in weeks what normally might take a year or more.”The trouble is, it’s getting harder and harder to hunt down the caterpillar fungus, which can’t grow fast enough to keep up with Chinese appetites.

New data from researchers at Yale University turns a piecemeal historical record into a comprehensive and accessible dataset of urban population figures since 3,700 B.C. Independently, Metrocosm blogger Max Galka used their data to map the rise of cities, showing a few thousand years of population changes in his three-minute video.  In Galka's video, you can see how much urbanization has sped up, from cities slowly appearing in earlier years, primarily located in the Middle East, to the dizzying expansion around the world in the last hundred years. The map marks the date of the earliest recorded population figure for each city, and dot size reflects relative population size, according to Galka's Metrocosm post.The data Galka used comes from “Spatializing 6,000 Years of Global Urbanization from 3700 B.C. to A.D. 2000,"" published by the journal Scientific Data earlier this month. The study was conducted by Meredith Reba, a research associate at Yale University's School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, along with Karen Seto, a Yale professor, and Femke Reitsma, a senior lecturer at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.They combed through two massive tomes of historical population figures, digitizing, combining and geotagging over 10,000 data entries for more than 1,700 cities.Their data, however, has multiple limitations -- for example, their sources differ on whether suburbs should be considered in cities’ population totals. Some regions aren't well represented in the data, and some cities are missing population figures for long stretches of time. But even with some inconsistencies and gaps, the expansive dataset could be a valuable resource for further study of cities.Reba told The Huffington Post she found it most fascinating to see the large declines in population resulting from natural disasters and human conflict like the Crusades.“To better understand urbanization today it is helpful to know what urbanization looked like through history,” she said in a statement. “By understanding how cities have grown and changed over time, throughout history, it might tell us something useful about how they are changing today.”This graphic shows the date of the first recorded population figures for each city in the data set the Yale University researchers used. Cities with the oldest data are in red. (The earliest population data figure could be later than when the city began, the researchers note.)The impact of rapid urbanization on the planet is a crucial topic.

New data from researchers at Yale University turns a piecemeal historical record into a comprehensive and accessible dataset of urban population figures since 3,700 B.C. Independently, Metrocosm blogger Max Galka used their data to map the rise of cities, showing a few thousand years of population changes in his three-minute video.  In Galka's video, you can see how much urbanization has sped up, from cities slowly appearing in earlier years, primarily located in the Middle East, to the dizzying expansion around the world in the last hundred years. The map marks the date of the earliest recorded population figure for each city, and dot size reflects relative population size, according to Galka's Metrocosm post.The data Galka used comes from “Spatializing 6,000 Years of Global Urbanization from 3700 B.C. to A.D. 2000,"" published by the journal Scientific Data earlier this month. The study was conducted by Meredith Reba, a research associate at Yale University's School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, along with Karen Seto, a Yale professor, and Femke Reitsma, a senior lecturer at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.They combed through two massive tomes of historical population figures, digitizing, combining and geotagging over 10,000 data entries for more than 1,700 cities.Their data, however, has multiple limitations -- for example, their sources differ on whether suburbs should be considered in cities’ population totals. Some regions aren't well represented in the data, and some cities are missing population figures for long stretches of time. But even with some inconsistencies and gaps, the expansive dataset could be a valuable resource for further study of cities.Reba told The Huffington Post she found it most fascinating to see the large declines in population resulting from natural disasters and human conflict like the Crusades.“To better understand urbanization today it is helpful to know what urbanization looked like through history,” she said in a statement. “By understanding how cities have grown and changed over time, throughout history, it might tell us something useful about how they are changing today.”This graphic shows the date of the first recorded population figures for each city in the data set the Yale University researchers used. Cities with the oldest data are in red. (The earliest population data figure could be later than when the city began, the researchers note.)The impact of rapid urbanization on the planet is a crucial topic.

The officers found the big cat in the yard.“Since it was still there, it was either injured or very ill, so they dispatched it,” Pitkin County Undersheriff Ron Ryan told the Aspen Times.The animal was killed at the scene, authorities said.Male mountain lions can grow up to eight feet in length (one-third of which consists of their tail) and weigh as much as 200 pounds, according to the National Park Service.Interactions between people and mountain lions, which are also known as pumas, cougars and panthers, has increased in recent years. The reasons include a decline in natural habitat as their numbers have grown, along with an increased deer population and density, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife.Attacks against humans are still relatively rare and mountain lions have killed fewer than a dozen people in North American in more than 100 years, according to the agency.""Most of the attacks were by young lions, perhaps forced out to hunt on their own and not yet living in established areas,""CPW states on its website. ""Young lions may key in on easy prey, like pets and small children."" The agency advises anyone under threat from a mountain lion to appear bigger by raising your arms, or open your jacket if you're wearing one. Throw objects such as stones at the animal if it gets aggressive and fight back if needed, the agency recommends.""Lions have been driven away by prey that fights back. People have fought back with rocks, sticks, caps or jackets, garden tools and their bare hands successfully. Remain standing or try to get back up!"" it states."

Conservation could be served on naturalistic sanctuaries without public viewing and often without public funding, and in purely wildlife-research focused facilities supported by government funding, such as the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and others.

Locking eyes with an ape or eagle can be life-changing. It was for me. That's why I'm not against zoos; I'm against bad zoos. Zoos must serve their animals both in their enclosures and in the wider world. When animals of the wider world serve zoos, there's a problem. And there is. Zoos, especially in Europe and the U.S., have a much larger proportion of captive-born than wild-caught animals than ever. But overall, zoos still take more animals from natural populations than they reintroduce to help natural populations recover. There have been notable exceptions where zoos bred endangered animals for successful reintroduction to the wild, perhaps the best being zoos' role in saving the California Condor and Golden Lion Tamarin monkey from extinction, and being the driving source for their recovery.

In response, this week Democrats in both the House and the Senate said ENOUGH, and demanded action to stem the rising tide of gun violence in our country.   On Monday, House Democrats refused to participate in the perfunctory moment of silence held after each mass shooting, pledging to remain silent no more. Then on Wednesday, Senate Democrats led by Chris Murphy of Connecticut, took the floor in a 15 hour filibuster to demand action on common sense legislation supported by 90% of the American people. We are proud to have joined in those efforts. Democrats in both chambers will no longer stand for business as usual in the face of these horrific gun crimes. Congress must honor the victims of this bloodshed not with merely thoughts and prayers, but with action.   What happened in Orlando on Sunday was shocking, and our hearts are broken for the victims and their loved ones. And while the scale of these mass shootings captures the nation's attention, the carnage caused by guns on the streets of Chicago every day is no less tragic. More than 280 people have been killed in this great city since the first of the year. Thousands more are living under siege in neighborhoods where they fear sitting on their front porches or letting their kids out to play because of the threat of gun violence.   No one in the United States of America should ever have to live this way.   That's why we are pushing in Washington to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. There are simple steps Congress can and must take to end this gun violence nightmare: We must make universal background checks the law of the land, and close a shocking loophole in current law that allows known or suspected terrorists to buy guns and even explosives. In 2015 we were informed that forty percent of the crime guns confiscated in the most violent neighborhoods in Chicago were coming from gun shows in Indiana where guns can be purchased without background checks. And despite having been on the terrorist watch list in the past, the Orlando shooter was able to purchase an assault weapon and ammunition to stage his attack.   Establishing universal background checks and closing this terrorist gun loophole will help keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons, the mentally unstable and individuals with ties to terrorism. This should be done now as a matter of national security and public safety. This is a starting point. We know that much more must be done to keep guns out of dangerous hands, and that the appalling gun violence in Orlando and here in Chicago is the consequence of inaction.   The pursuit of gun reform is personal for us. And we won't stop -- not until all Americans everywhere can live free from the threat of gun violence."

I say this with the utmost respect for those with mental challenges and apologize for any insult they may experience by being unceremoniously lumped in the same category as me.I like to think it is because I have managed to retain my childlike wonder at the simple things in life that others take for granted.When I began dating my first husband, Mike lived in a guest house behind a very old house in Hollywood. Beneath his tiny cottage lived a family of baby skunks and their mother.If you have never seen a baby skunk, you will not understand the overwhelming urge we had to call for them at night so we could take in their unbelievable cuteness.It is very important to treat a baby skunk with the gentleness one would a kitten, so its mother doesn't come out and spray you. Thus, as softly and endearingly as we could, we would call ""Here kitty, kitty, kitty,"" and more often than not the baby skunks would emerge and visit us.As time passed we began to say ""Here kitty, kitty, kitty,"" every time we saw a cute animal no matter what its species or age. And it became part of our personal intimate vocabulary.One morning, Mike and I were having brunch at an upscale café in Santa Monica that we frequently patronized. The food was delicious and it was bright and airy because of the floor to ceiling windows.As I gazed out the window, I noticed a dog that looked exactly like a baby lamb, tethered to a tree right outside the café. I was filled with delight and elation, causing my voice to become high and unstable.""Mike, look at that dog out there! It looks like a baby lamb! It's soooo cute!""I began calling toward the window, ""Here kitty, kitty, kitty.""It was then that I noticed the well-dressed, immaculately groomed woman at the table next to ours, watching me with an expression of pity, compassion and eagerness.""Oh, that's my dog."" She spoke slowly and deliberately and I thought perhaps she may have had a recent stroke.""What kind of dog is it?"" My voice was still high and unstable from my near hysteria at seeing the cutest dog ever in the history of the world.The woman leaned in closer to me and looked at me intently. ""It's a Bedlington Terrier,"" she said even more slowly and deliberately than before, emphasizing each syllable.I was now starting to grin at her like an idiot because I was confused and a little disoriented by her strange demeanor.She looked at me even more closely and said, ""Bed-ling-ton.

The jury is way out on whether Trump can do the same. But the danger is there.,2016-06-18,"Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a rally at Southside Ballroom in Dallas, Texas on June 16, 2016. / AFP / Laura Buckman (Photo credit should read LAURA BUCKMAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81a0a2600003001837bdd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most polls at present show that Hillary Clinton will beat Trump in their presumed presidential face-off in the Fall. The problem with this is that polls measure what people tell pollsters and that's what ends up in their numbers and percentage crunching. In some cases, the numbers ultimately prove right and the presidential candidates that polls show will win do win. This may or may not be the case in trying to figure out where Trump really stands with millions of voters. He's banking that the polls are dead wrong. In a speech back in July in Phoenix he reached back more than four decades and snatched at a line and a concept that then GOP presidential candidate Richard Nixon pulled out of his political hat in November, 1969. Nixon publicly called on those he dubbed ""the silent majority"" to bail him out on his plan to settle the Vietnam War. Nixon had much more in mind than drumming up support for his war plan -- he had coined a new code word for millions of mostly white, conservative, blue collar and middle income voters, who were appalled by and mad as hell at the ghetto riots, campus demonstrations, rampant drug and ""permissive"" culture and disrespect for law. They were in Nixon's view so denigrated, mocked, marginalized and pushed to the side by the mainstream media, and ignored by Washington politicians and bureaucrats, that they would hit back, and hit back hard, in the one way they knew how. That was at the polls. That meant a vote for Nixon. The implication was that untold numbers of these closet Nixon backers might not show up in the polls as Nixon supporters precisely because they weren't part of a voter sample. Or, if they were, they wouldn't tip their hand about backing Nixon. A decade later, the hidden bias, masked feeling and the penchant of many white voters to shade, deceive or just plain lie to pollsters and interviewers when they told them that color didn't mean anything to them in an election, surfaced with a vengeance in the heated contest for California governor in 1982. Polls consistently showed L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley would beat his white GOP rival and become the first African-American governor. The polls were wrong and Bradley lost. Pollsters tried everything they could afterwards to weed out hidden bias in the polls with mixed results.In Trump's case, the issue isn't race in trying to decipher why many voters might not let on how they really feel about him. It's how he's been routinely caricatured, and that's as a clown, loud mouth, liar, conniver, racist and women/immigrant/Muslim-basher. These aren't exactly the qualities of person, let alone a presidential candidate, that would make someone proudly tell pollsters, or anyone else that they would stand in a line to vote for. The primaries gave a clue about how this presidential election cycle is unlike few others in modern times. Even though polls showed Trump at the top ahead of his GOP rivals for months before the first primary, the experts were virtually unanimous that the polls couldn't really be believed, and that he would wither on the vine in the first round of the primaries. The polls for the most part were right about his popularity. But since then with his wave of shoot from the lip bluster and fights with Obama blaming him for the Orlando massacre, and his double and triple down in attacks on Muslims, the same polls are showing him slipping further behind Clinton. Can they really be believed? The brutal reality is that millions think that Muslims are terrorists, and that the country is under siege, that the Obama administration and Clinton would do a lousy job in protecting them and that they haven't done a darn thing about keeping jobs here. And, worse, they'd take away their guns. They are likely to seethe in quiet anger at the sight of demonstrators repeatedly disrupting Trump rallies and clashing in the streets with police. Many, when asked, might not express that anger and frustration. Worse, as Nixon played on and up, they aren't even asked how they feel about issues, or paid any attention to. Yet they more than showed in the primaries when they voted for Trump that they are there in massive numbers.People say there aren't enough less educated, blue-collar white men in the electorate to push Trump over the top. But that's misleading. Trump has actually gotten a lot of votes from middle class white people -- male and female, college educated, business and professional people.There's more still to the potential Trump vote total. Elections are almost always won by candidates with a solid and impassioned core of bloc voters. In Trump's case, white males, older voters, middle-income, college educated voters, vote consistently and faithfully. And most times they vote in a far greater percentage than Hispanics and blacks, and especially young voters.Nixon was definitely on to something in 1969 when he corralled his silent majority and bagged the White House. The jury is way out on whether Trump can do the same. But the danger is there. --Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

14,PARENTS,When Your Child Steps Into Your Shoes,"Johnathan Lee Iverson, ContributorChoirboy, Traveling man, Ringmaster of The Greatest Show On Ea...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-your-child-steps-int_b_10540454.html,,2016-06-18,2016-06-18-1466222689-8540859-Matthew_Adrianna.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-18-1466222689-8540859-Matthew_Adrianna-thumb.jpg,"Three years after I married my wonderful wife, our beloved son was born. He had me at the sonogram. He was merely a centimeter when we first saw him, but he was the most precious centimeter I'd ever laid eyes on. When he was born I became certain of two things: first, I never wanted to be away from him and; second, after watching my wife give birth, the idea that men and women are equal is an absurdity. These feelings were repeated when my daughter was born a few years later.Parenting, as I've come to realize, is a tremendous balancing act in which you, the parent, attempt to reconcile how your child can be so much like you and yet completely his or her own person. It's being reintroduced to yourself, but you are not exactly a complete stranger. I absolutely love being a father. It has its challenges, but it wouldn't be love if it didn't. It's a privilege to love someone simply because they are, just as it's a privilege for me to receive love simply because I am. My daughter is of the age where my very presence is a cause for celebration. Perhaps that's been the most surprising wonder for me in this adventure called fatherhood: presence. To know how much being here, present in their lives, means to them and, in many respects, how much it means to me. It has been a revelation of sorts. We are mistaken if we believe our children require much. The act of showing up and paying attention to who they are and informing who they become is the fundamental building blocks of the parent-child relationship.I wasn't as fortunate as my children. My father played a cameo role in my life. He and I bonded, somewhat, over debates about our favorite prize-fighters during drives to Brooklyn from Manhattan for visits with my grandmother. Muhammad Ali seemed to be our only point of agreement. That's about as intimate as it got between us. Nevertheless, I was always blessed with some wonderful surrogates -- be they uncles, godfathers, teachers or even my older brother. I gained confidence in being a performing member of a world-class boy choir. I had a talent that was opening remarkable doors for me. I actually came to the point where I convinced myself that my father wasn't necessary -- so I thought. However, the emotional life of men and boys is far more complex than our society has yet to realize and it would do us well to recognize and rectify this. No one goes unaffected by the absence or failures of a parent. It took my father's sudden death for me to realize this. Despite all those amazing surrogates, all the success, even the wonder that is my mother, I was missing something. The day before he passed away, we had the most engaging conversation. I wouldn't grasp it until 24 hours later, but he seemed to be condensing everything a father would say to his son over a lifetime into one conversation. He spoke to me about everything from money to relationships, but what has stayed with me until this day is what he told me about his own journey of reconciliation with his father. He recounted all the heartbreak and disappointment he carried into his adult years, which created enmity within him against his father and may very well have informed his own life's choices, but he would ultimately come to understand and even forgive his father. This was his apology to me. He didn't say it, but it was clear, as it was confirmed in his last words to me that day: ""You have to do better."" He gave me permission to not walk in his shoes. This year, my son is joining me in the highly anticipated Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey® Presents Out Of This World™. It's been utterly surreal watching him stand in center ring, looking like a young incarnation of me, and belt out those famous lines, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, Children Of All Ages..."" Not a hint of hesitancy or trepidation is to be found in him. He's been the absolute paragon of confidence during this long and arduous rehearsal process for the show. It's his first job and he's only 11 years old. I was 11 years old when I stepped foot into the rehearsal halls of the world-renowned Boys Choir of Harlem to begin my journey in entertainment. It was work for sure, but it was certainly not employment. Happiness cannot begin to describe how my son felt upon being asked to join the cast of The Greatest Show On Earth®. As close as we are, I seriously had no idea this might be something he would even consider. He's far more cerebral than I was when I was his age. He's always reveled in the process that goes into the building of a Ringling Bros.® show, how it's made and how it all comes together. He's fantastically creative. Place him in a playground or park, and with just a few sticks, rocks and some dirt he'll construct an entire habitat. He's always been the kid with the blocks, Legos and such, although lately he's been veering toward coding. I never would have taken him to be someone who wanted to be a performer.Yet, as I've had the pleasure to watch him work in these rehearsals, it is obvious he's been watching his dad for quite some time. I can tell from his intonation to his posture that he has. He is quite good; in fact he is very good. What's most impressive is that he has grasped the responsibility of such an opportunity and what he must do to keep it and succeed in it. It's been a growing experience for me as well. I've purposely stepped back and allowed him to learn, fail, and succeed on his own - not the easiest thing to do for a father, especially watching my son attempt my trade. However, he's made it so much easier with his ability to take direction and respect the environment he is in.Following in the footsteps of parents is a culture in and of itself in the world of the circus, whether in families of animal trainers, daredevils or producers. In fact, my son is cast alongside the daughter of our star clown Davis Vassallo. When your child steps into your shoes (or in my case, my boots) or has the desire to do so, it is by far one of the greatest testaments to the bond between parent and child. You realize as a parent that much of what your children will learn from you is often left unsaid. Make no mistake, your children are terrifically aware, no matter the age. They're truth machines. They may not always be capable of articulating it, but they see us for exactly who and what we are. Now my son gets to peek behind the curtain and fully engage in the process, as well as learn who I am, en route to the spotlight. And I get to be present while he does it. I think I might manage ""...to do better"" after all."

We would like to wake up and make it go away, but we can't. Incomprehensible carnage from the barrel of a gun. Impassioned demands for action to be taken by those we elect to protect us. Political intimidation by the gun lobby. The defeat of common sense gun restrictions in Congress. The certainty that we will live this nightmare again and again. Unless we change the politics of guns.Given the apparent inevitability that Congress will fail to take meaningful action in the wake of the most deadly mass shooting in American history, it may be difficult to rise above the despair. But there are signs that gun control is gaining in political viability. The Democratic Party finally has stopped running from the gun issue. It was not long ago that leading Democratic strategists like James Carville and Paul Begala advised Party leaders that the gun issue is not worth the political risk. It was during the first Obama Administration that Congressional Democrats, when they were in charge, resisted efforts to move gun legislation in a futile effort to protect the ""Blue Dogs"" in districts perceived to be hostile to gun restrictions. For the Democrats, it all changed after Newtown. The slaughter of six-year-olds quickly made political risk a secondary consideration. For the first time since the Clinton Presidency, the Democratic Party seems to be ""all in"" for stronger gun laws. President Obama's eloquence on the gun issue has been unparalleled. There is no doubt that Hillary Clinton's passion on the issue is genuine, reflecting the commitment of her husband during his Presidency when his support helped to pass both the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban. It should not be forgotten that President Clinton ensured that Jim and Sarah Brady would appear in prime time at the Democratic Convention in 1996.Perhaps nothing illustrates the post-Newtown change in Democratic Party attitudes toward gun control more powerfully than the constant beating Bernie Sanders has taken from Hillary Clinton over his votes against the Brady Bill and in favor of special legal protection for the gun industry. Sanders has been constantly on the defensive on the gun issue. It sends a message to other Democratic candidates and office-holders: regardless of how progressive you are on other issues, if you pander to the NRA, you will suffer political pain. It is the mirror image of the long-time political reality for Republican candidates: you can be conservative on every other issue, but if you cross the NRA, you will pay a price. Whether the Republican reality begins to weaken may depend on the political fortunes of Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is running for reelection this year and was a devoted NRA disciple until after Newtown, when he co-sponsored a universal background check bill with Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), himself a previously ardent gun rights supporter. That two previously NRA A-rated Senators sponsored a meaningful gun control measure is another indication that the gun issue is not the political third rail for as many politicians as it used to be. For all those hopeful signs, though, the U.S. Senate is poised to defeat, yet again, legislation to bar people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns, as well as universal background checks. It's clear that the politics of guns still must change if the NRA is to be stripped of its veto power over gun legislation. What must happen?At the core of the problem is the so-called ""intensity gap,"" that is, the perception by the political class that opponents of gun laws feel more intensely about the issue, and are motivated to engage in various forms of activism and political activity more frequently, than supporters of gun laws. Surveys show that gun control opponents are far more likely than gun control supporters to give money, contact a public official, express an opinion on a social networking site, or sign a petition than gun control supporters. A 2014 Yale University survey showed that among voters who thought gun laws should be less strict, 71 percent said they would never vote for a political candidate who did not share their position on gun control, compared with just 34 percent of those who support stricter gun laws. This gap is ameliorated to some degree by the fact that far more Americans favor making our gun laws more strict than favor weakening them, but nevertheless the perception remains strong that pro-gun partisans will ""vote"" the issue, whereas gun control partisans will not. President Obama recognized the problem in expressing his frustration that Congress would not act during his Administration to strengthen gun laws. In January of this year, he declared his intention to become a ""single-issue"" voter on guns, writing in the New York Times that he would no longer support candidates who do not support ""common-sense gun reform."" He challenged other gun law supporters to do the same. Unless this ""intensity gap"" can be narrowed, the politics of guns is likely to remain a stalemate. There are reasons for hope. After Newtown, there was an explosion of gun control activism, with existing organizations energized and new organizations forming. From my perspective outside the gun control movement, it appears that, three years after Newtown, the level of activism remains at levels far higher than before Newtown. It is a new and firmer foundation to build on.  Too many politicians, particularly in swing suburban areas, believe that the gun issue carries political risk only if they vote against the NRA. A growing army of passionate, committed gun control voters can convince them otherwise. How many of us will heed President's Obama's call?"

While there have been countless debates, tests and judgments that have defined and re-defined how to interpret this amendment, the current prevailing interpretation and belief in America is that individual gun ownership is a constitutional right. As a result, America has seen a steady and consistent stream of deregulation around gun ownership, even as mass shootings appear to be on the rise. As progressives get increasingly concerned about the gun culture in America, as a tactic, they try to make their case by comparing gun ownership to other safety-related, common-sense laws:While certainly humorous while making a practical point, this tweet burn completely misses the larger point: people don't have a constitutional right to buy Sudafed. You simply cannot compare a constitutional right to anything else not on the fundamental rights playing field. This lack of focus on the constitutional argument is where progressives have lost their way. They have been so focused on the practical utility of public policy that they end up losing the larger fights that define America. Constitutional interpretation lends itself to a more strategic (and philosophical) debate platform than arguing the facts and stats on how laws can and should protect people. Constitutional theory is the debate platform that conservatives have been playing on for decades while progressives get frustrated and lose ground.The remarkable irony is that the wording and intent within the Second Amendment is actually on progressive's side. In fact, the Second Amendment is a progressive's dream: the third word in the amendment is ""regulated"" for heaven's sake.No matter the interpretation of every other word and phrase after the first three words, the entire context of the amendment is that it will be a regulated right. Through this lens, the Second Amendment is barely even comparable to the First Amendment in terms of what rights it enables. There is simply no language in the First Amendment that regulates the right to free speech... and yet we still regulate speech despite the unassailable strength of the the First Amendment constitutional languageThe upshot? Even in today's hardcore gun rights environment and culture, the Constitution itself provides the guidance -- and mandate -- to not just regulate militia (i.e., groups of people) and arms, but to regulate them well. How our culture defines ""well"" can and will certainly evolve over time, but we shouldn't let gun rights ideologues and arms industry special interests continue to convince the public that they're the only ones who have the Constitution on their side in this debate. Yes, current Supreme Court interpretation is that every citizen has the right to bear arms. But it's also constitutionally mandated that we regulate these armed people (i.e., militia) and their arms well. Seeing as the right to bear arms has been implemented pretty effectively in America, perhaps now it's time to start implementing regulation well too, as the Constitution also mandates."

The mass shooting killed 49 people and injuring 53 others in what is the deadliest mass shooting in the country's history. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81a17240000510098b6cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We woke up last Sunday morning to news of the senseless slaughter of 49 innocents at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Because many of the victims were gay, it appeared that this had been a hate crime.It wasn't long before the killer was identified as Omar Mateen, the American-born son of an Afghan immigrant to the United States. Law enforcement officials cautioned against any rush to judgment insisting that they were still investigating ""troubling aspects"" of the crime. Nevertheless, as soon as politicians, pundits, and the mainstream media heard the news of the faith of the perpetrator, they were off to the races. Donald Trump immediately congratulated himself for ""being right on ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and reiterated his call for a ban on Muslims coming to the US. He went further suggesting that ""something was going on"" with President Obama, implying that the President either knew more about the murders than he was admitting or had been derelict in his duty to stop this terrorist threat. While many Republicans expressed outrage at Trump's ""hints"" of presidential culpability, it was almost universally accepted that this had been an act of ""Muslim terror"". New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, for example, struck out against ""radical Muslims"" saying ""these people hate us because of who we are, and they're going to try and kill us, and that's what this is all about...we've got to hit back."" For their part, the networks also accepted this as ""fact"", devoting endless hours to nonsense chatter from ""terrorism experts"" who despite knowing very little about the crime in question were not going to pass up an opportunity to appear on TV. And then there were columns and commentaries galore about ISIS, violence and homophobia in Islam, what should be done to stop the ""radicalization"" of Muslim youth, and praise for or criticism of what the Obama Administration was or was not doing to stop the next ""terrorist attack"" from, as Trump and his GOP colleagues would have it, ""radical Islam.""The problem with this narrative version of the Orlando massacre is that it doesn't hold up when we look at it more closely. Another explanation is possible. Consider the following: Omar Mateen was a deeply disturbed man with a long record of violent and disruptive behavior and spousal abuse. He also seems to have had conflicted feelings about his sexual orientation. Mateen had frequented gay nightclubs and internet gay dating sites. The report that he recently became enraged expressing disgust when he saw two men kissing in public puts the finishing touches on what appears to be the classic portrait of a very sick individual living a lie and tormented by his own confused sexuality. Unable to resolve his inner conflict, he exploded striking out at gay people because he feared that he, himself, was gay. He was destroying them because he wanted to destroy that part of himself. Seen in this light, the despicable senseless mass murder in Orlando would have little or nothing to do with Islam or ""radicalization"". ISIS, it appears, was only used by the murderer in an effort to ""cover his tracks"" -- that is to say, to mask his true motivation. ISIS didn't lead him to this act of mass homicide. They didn't train him or inspire him. In some of his communications, Mateen conflated ISIS with Hizbollah demonstrating that he either didn't understand or didn't care to understand that group's demented ideology. His final message, pledging loyalty to ISIS, would be his final act of denial. He was lying to himself and the world about who he was and why he did what he did. Being the despicable group that they are, ISIS proudly embraced the sick murderer's claim of allegiance. A conversation about a man driven to an insane act of mass murder because he was unable to reconcile himself to his sexual inclination might not have served the perverse purposes of Donald Trump or our political/media culture. Such a discussion might not have been good for ratings and wouldn't have played on the public's fear of Muslims or create rage against President Obama. It should be noted that there were many stories that needed to be told after Orlando -- all of which were ignored or given short shrift. In the first place, despite the outpouring of support for the victims of the massacre, gay people remain vulnerable to hate crimes and the disgraceful intolerance demonstrated by traditionalists of all stripes (MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, for example, played videotapes of two Baptist preachers expressing the delight that 49 were killed!). It is likely that it was this fear of being rejected and stigmatized that may have festered inside of Mateen finally exploding in his deranged act.And then there is the issue of assault weapons. It should be clear that it is the very availability of these instruments of death that is responsible for the epidemic of devastating mass killings in the US. These weapons are not for hunters; they are for murderers. They should be banned.And finally, we need to carefully examine our terminology. If Mateen had been a Christian, like the Charleston slayer, would we have termed the killings ""terrorism""? Would the media have indulged itself in an examination about ""what's wrong with Christianity""? Would we have called for surveillance of everyone with a Confederate flag license plate? The assumption that a murder by a Muslim is fundamentally different is not only wrong-headed, it keeps us from more closely examining the deeper problem of mass killings and their causes.

(SSGT Phil Schmitten)June 17, 2016Since 1983, Sharon Tennison has worked to develop ordinary citizens' capacities to avert international crises, focusing on relations between the U.S. and Russia. Now, amid a rising crisis in relations between the U.S. and Russia, she has organized a delegation which assembled in Moscow yesterday for a two week visit. I joined the group yesterday, and happened to finish reading Sharon Tennison's book, The Power of Impossible Ideas, when I landed in Moscow.An entry in her book, dated November 9, 1989, describes the excitement over the Berlin Wall coming down and notes that ""Prior to the Wall's removal, President Reagan assured Secretary General Gorbachev that if he would support bringing down the Wall separating East and West Berlin, NATO would not move 'a finger's width' closer to Russia than East Germany's border. With this assurance Gorbachev gladly signed on. Little could he or the world have guessed that this promise would soon be broken during the next administration - and that the redeveloping distrust between the countries would threaten to become a second cold War, due to NATO's expansion up to Russia's borders.""Today, NATO and U.S. troops will conclude 10 days of military exercises, Anakonda, on Russia's western border, involving 31,000 troops. The operation was named after a snake that kills by crushing its prey. Ongoing deployment of 4,000 additional NATO troops has been announced. U.S. and South Korean military exercises just completed at the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea were dubbed ""Decapitation"" and mobilized 320,000 troops.Conn Hallinan, in ""Bear Baiting Russia,"" notes that ""Russia has two bases in the Middle East and a handful in Central Asia. The U.S. has 662 bases in foreign countries around the world and Special Forces (SOF) deployed in between 70 and 90 countries at any moment. Last year SOFs were active in 147 countries. The U.S. is actively engaged in five wars and is considering a sixth in Libya. Russian military spending will fall next year, and the U.S. will out-spend Moscow by a factor of 10. Who in this comparison looks threatening?"" It's important for U.S. people to learn more, from ordinary Russian people, about their responses to troop build-up and new bases on their borders, threatening military exercises, and antagonistic arsenals of nuclear weapons on high alert. As President Vladimir Putin begins summoning a new Russian National Guard that could include 400,000 troops, it's important to hear how Russian people feel about this development.Rather than foster cartoonized versions of foreign policy, the media should help people recognize complexity in Russian society and include awareness of desires to live in peace on the part of people in both countries.U.S. people committed to peace making might help ordinary Russians sense the complexity of U.S. society and better understand how U.S. military spending and build up toward war adversely affects civil society in the U.S. Suppose someone in Russia were to ask me what I was doing before coming to Russia. In honesty, I'd explain that the previous week companions and I finished a 150 mile walk to a supermax prison in my home state of Illinois which could eventually subject 1900 people to tortuous years of solitary confinement, doubling the number of such cells in the U.S. Like the military-industrial complex in the U.S., the prison-industrial complex is now rooted in government salaries and corporate profits, and it's hard to uproot it.Before joining the walk, I lived for several weeks in late May and early June with young volunteers in Kabul who long to ""live without war."" 15 years into the U.S. war in Afghanistan, the U.S. has ""succeeded"" in creating conditions for ongoing war.NATO and U.S. officials claim that their military exercises in countries around the world will enhance international security, but those of us who are members of the delegation here in Russia believe that it's essential to swiftly reverse the present trend toward Cold Wars with Russia and China. The fantasy of world domination endangers people throughout the world and within the U.S. as people again shudder over the possibility of war between nuclear armed powers.This morning, Dmitri Babich, an active journalist for over 25 years focusing on Russian politics, said it's important to name the problem we face, and he believes the fundamental problem is the U.S. insistence on being institutional supremacists, - exceptionalists.In other words, the policy fantasy that stands in the way of addressing major world problems cooperatively is the idea that the United States can retain and expand the boundaries of ""sole superpower"" domination. United States policy should stop poking and provoking Russia and China along their frontiers, and instead seek negotiated peaceful coexistence.Missiles fitted with thermonuclear warheads and on battle-ready status are unstable, and, at any time, can result in the catastrophic destruction of cities on both sides, and even the ending of civilized life on earth.With active cooperation among the great powers and large reductions in wasteful competitive military spending, all countries could cooperatively address the threats from climate change, water shortages, regional underdevelopment, and economic pressures caused by population growth. Ordinary people everywhere should do all that we can to demand that all international disputes be resolved by non-military means, avoiding all wars and achieving the deactivation of all nuclear weapons.Sharon Tennison's work to develop citizen-to-citizen diplomacy, since 1983, suggests that people could work together to tackle such problems.But, informed public opinion in the U.S. and in Russia will be crucially needed. My friend Brad Lyttle, a lead organizer of and participant in the ""San Francisco to Moscow Walk"" (1960 -1961) recently wrote to President Obama that there is no reason why the U.S. and Russia should continue to jeopardize the very existence of the human species with their huge nuclear arsenals. ""Work with President Putin to reduce and eliminate these,"" wrote Brad. ""Emphasize a trustful and positive approach. Don't assume that the future needs always to be as bad as much of the past.""Kathy Kelly (kathy@vcnv.org) co-coordinates Voices for Creative Nonviolence www.vcnv.org"

I will go to the human rights court. I will prove to the IAAF and WADA that they made the wrong decision,” she said, referring to the World Anti-Doping Agency.A Kremlin spokesman, speaking hours before the ban was extended, said: “Everything possible needed to defend the rights of our athletes and the Olympic team is being done and will be done at a legal level.""The IOC merely “took note” of the decision but said it would discuss the situation in a telephone conference on Saturday.The United States Olympic Committee described it as a step in the right direction.“It gives a measure of hope to clean athletes that there are consequences not only for athletes who dope, but for countries which do not engage seriously in the fight against doping,” it said.Stephanie Hightower, president of US Track and Field and an IAAF Council member, said it was “the only proper course of action given the compelling and powerful evidence presented to Council.“We do not believe that every Russian athlete cheated, and it is unfortunate and regrettable that some may pay a penalty for the serious transgressions of their federation.""There was some sympathy elsewhere too for innocent Russian athletes, with American Olympic decathlon silver medalist Trey Hardee saying: “Sad day for Russian athletes.

At least three of the victims, two of whom survived, are undocumented.While much has been done to raise money for medical and domestic travel expenses in the wake of Sunday’s tragedy, many of the Latino survivors and victims’ families continue to face a mounting number of unique challenges, such as dealing with language barriers, obtaining visas and organizing repatriation logistics for the deceased. In the hours following the shooting, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Metro Orlando received a request from the city of Orlando to recruit bilingual certified translators and licensed mental health professionals. ""We put out that call to our community and were inundated with the response. We were getting an email every second,"" Diana Bolívar, the chamber's president, told The Huffington Post.Still, Bolívar notes, many other immediate needs loomed large -- particularly for legal, medical and financial assistance. Enter Somos Orlando, a coalition of nonprofits with an accompanying bilingual website launched by the Hispanic Federation to help Latino victims find legal, medical and mental health resources in their own language. The services provided by the volunteer mental health and legal professionals through Somos Orlando are especially invaluable, as undocumented survivors are not eligible for state programs beyond emergency care.Similarly, Equality Florida is working to connect survivors and their families with resources that may help mitigate or offset the financial burden of medical bills, legal fees, travel costs and the cost of ongoing care to survivors and victims' families. They initiated the primary donor fund, which has now raised more that $4 million.“Every penny of that is going to the families,” Cindy Brown, the Miami development officer at Equality Florida, explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. “That fund will be facilitated with a series of lawyers with the National Center for Victims of Crime in order to specifically address things like travel, burial costs, ongoing medical expenses, mental health treatment for not only people who were shot, but people whose friends died in front of them. There are a lot of needs that are known now and there are even more for years to come.”Those needs include things like ongoing physical therapy and counseling for PTSD.Then there are pressing legal and immigration needs. In the days since the massacre at Pulse, Sasha Westerman-Keuning, P.A.,co-chair of the LGBTQ Affairs Committee for the South Florida Chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, says she’s already received inquiries for legal assistance for family members of victims who are non-U.S. citizens. Some of them need tourist visas or humanitarian parole documents to enter the U.S. to see loved ones in the hospital, or to travel to make burial or transportation arrangements.Westerman-Keuning says the committee also wants to make sure undocumented survivors of the attack qualify for ""certain types of immigration relief."" For example, some might need asylum if they've been outed to family back home and it would be too dangerous to return; others might qualify for widow or widower benefits if their immigration status is based on marriage to a citizen; still others might qualify for U visa status as victims of a serious crime in the United States.“We want to ensure that all victims and their families receive the highest quality legal service from qualified immigration attorneys,"" Westerman-Keuning said. ""This is our small way of being able to give back to the community and support of LBGT brothers and sisters as well as their families in this dire time of need.”For more information on the resources available to survivors and victims' families, visit the website of SomosOrlando and Equality Florida's Pulse page.Donate to Orlando here:"

Run” Simmons has not only influenced music fans through the years, it has also led him to becoming an inspirational father on television.In 2005, the Run–D.M.C. member-turned-reverend brought his family values and entertainment into the homes of millions with the debut of his MTV reality series, “Run’s House.” Starring his wife, Justine, daughters Vanessa and Angela, and sons, JoJo, Diggy, and Russy, the series chronicled the day-to-day lives of the family living in Saddle River, New Jersey.Following six seasons on the air, the popular series -- which was executive produced by Russell Simmons and Sean “Diddy” Combs -- would also serve as a launching pad for the family to star in additional reality shows including, “Rev Run's Renovation,” “Rev Run's Sunday Suppers,” and “Rev Runs Around the World.”So what’s the greatest reward from Run’s experience to showcase his skills as the patriarch of his family to a televised audience? The answer, according to the good reverend, is being able to influence his fellow peers.“For me, from ‘Run’s House,’ to the cooking show, to the travel show, to the renovation show, you find out when you slow down that it’s very pleasurable to be with your family. You look at Jay Z, and he’s so calm now,” he said during an interview with The Huffington Post. “You see after all that he’s been through, there [are] pictures with him walking on vacation, holding Blue Ivy’s hand with Beyoncé. And you see all these people becoming couples now. There are a bunch of artists who have watched my progress, and I feel pretty good that they saw ‘Run’s House,’ and it’s great.”During its airing, “Run’s House” contributed to boosting MTV’s network ratings and inspired other family-based reality shows, including “Snoop Dogg's Father Hood,” and “T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle,” to name a few.The 51-year-old went on to add that his influence to inspire MCs to rap has seamlessly transitioned into inspiring them to become nurturing fathers.“Me being a family man, being a husband, being a father, comes naturally, and I guess it’s a gift that God gave me so I could spread the knowledge of family. So it’s important to me, but it also comes pretty natural to me. It may not come as natural to everybody else,” he said.Simmons also credits his very own father, Daniel Simmons Sr., for providing him and his brothers, Russell and Daniel Jr., with the necessary life skills that have influenced his decision to showcase his family to viewers.“My father was a pretty good family man, so we’re all here to help each other, and it takes work,” he adds. “I love to post pictures of me and my family together. I love doing reality television with my family. So yeah, it’s a conscious effort to tell people about it; but also, not only is it a conscious effort, people find that when they start to get closer to their family that they're making progress with their children. You get to know what’s in their life, you get to enjoy your wife and your children more, and you find out that the things that you think are the small things, are actually the big things.”You can catch more of Rev. Run’s family values when the latest season of “Rev Runs Around the World” premieres on The Travel Channel this summer."

Seriously.,2016-06-17,"Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, has been a pretty involved dad. Here he is with his son, Prince George of Cambridge.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5764117d2200002e00f819a2.jpeg?cache=jXwr6FzanS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This Father’s Day, how about we try and make men feel good about spending time away from work and with their kids? Because while more men want to be involved dads -- and increasingly, we expect them to be -- fathers still have to overcome a lot of judgment if they make that choice. A new survey about paternity leave from consulting firm Deloitte makes this painfully clear.Even though 64 percent of the working adults polled said companies should offer men and women equal amounts of paid family leave to care for a new child, more than half of respondents said men would be judged negatively for taking the same amount of leave as a woman.Both men and women were hesitant to take leave. More than one-third of respondents said they wouldn’t take advantage of their company’s paid leave benefits because they worried it could jeopardize their jobs. And 41 percent of men and women surveyed thought they’d lose out on opportunities if they took the time away.But men were particularly worried: 57 percent of the male respondents thought that if they took leave, their colleagues would think they weren’t committed to their work.Mind you, these are the ""lucky"" dads who actually get paid family leave. Only 14 percent of employers offer paternity leave, according to a survey from the Families and Work Institute.In the conversation about work-family balance and angst, women get most of the attention. Less appreciated is the double bind men face. Culturally, we now expect men to be more involved at home but we haven’t loosened up workplace norms. Dads are expected to be breadwinners who are 100 percent devoted to their jobs. If they don’t demonstrate this devotion, they’re often penalized.It’s the flip side of what people seem to want from working mothers, who are expected to be moms above all else. Sure, moms can work. Indeed, if they “just” stay home, they catch shit for that, too. But a woman who doesn’t put her kids first is judged pretty harshly. And a working mom will also suffer at work, one way or another. Female consultants who seemed to prioritize their jobs were judged to be bad moms at one consulting firm analyzed in a 2015 paper by Boston University researchers. As Bloomberg's Rebecca Greenfield points out, women have long been penalized for taking parental leave by missing out on promotions or promising work.Men face a similar fate, though they're not judged to be bad fathers for prioritizing work. In fact, devoted fathers are expected to prioritize work. But men do face penalties for taking leave. In some cases, men who take leave have returned to find themselves skipped over for raises or promotions -- or even just mocked by coworkers.As one male consultant told researchers who authored the Boston University paper last year, “The idea of a guy taking paternity leave was just [makes face] for my managers. Guys just don’t do that. They teased me. Then one of the partners said to me, ‘You have a choice to make: Are you going to be a professional or are you going to just be an average person in your field? If you are going to be a professional then that means nothing can be as important to you as your work.’”Some men at this firm pretended to work 80-hour weeks and snuck off to spend more time with their families to avoid stigma.In his book All In: How Our Work-First Culture Fails Dads, Families, and Businesses -- And How We Can Fix It Together, Josh Levs tells the heartbreaking story of one lawyer who was a rising star at his firm until his pregnant wife attempted suicide. The man took unpaid time off to care for her, and his job was never the same. He was assigned less prestigious work and ultimate fired, Levs wrote in an article for the Harvard Business Review.“It’s incumbent on companies to start model cultures and create transparency so men feel they can take leave,” Deepa Purushothaman, managing principal for talent and inclusion at Deloitte, told The Huffington Post.She said that at Deloitte, which offers 8 weeks paid time off to parents regardless of gender, the plan is to make it acceptable for everyone to take time off. There’s particularly focus on male leaders who are expected to be role models, take leave and come back and talk about it.Purushothaman pointed to the most well-known corporate dad role model out there: Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who was applauded for taking two months of paternity leave after his daughter was born. Still, that was only half the amount of paid leave Facebook offers.Studies have shown, time and again, that paternity leave benefits fathers and children, who build stronger bonds right off the bat. It also helps mothers. When men take leave, that evens the playing field for everyone. So let's give dads a break at the office -- and at home, too. Far too often, fathers get portrayed as hapless idiots who can't change a diaper, fold the laundry or get the kids to bed.That's ridiculous. "

The 26-year-old had been shot multiple times, and said he felt certain that he wouldn’t leave the club alive.“I hear [the gunman] come back and he’s shooting everyone that’s already dead on the floor, making sure they’re dead,” Colon told reporters at Orlando Regional Medical Center on Tuesday. “I look over and he shoots the girl next to me.

The praise is surprising, given that the TV host began beefing with Eminem in 2009 when the rapper released a song about Carey. Cannon also recently challenged Marshall Mathers to a $100,000 rap battle. Though Cannon and Carey aren't officially divorced yet (they split in 2014), the singer already has another wedding in the works.

Curry’s tweet, which was later deleted, was posted just after her husband was fouled out and ejected for arguing the call and throwing his mouthpiece at a fan (Steph Curry later said it was an accident and apologized to the man).According to Yahoo! Sports, this was the first time in the back-to-back MVP's career that he'd been ejected from a game. It was also the first ejection in a Finals game in 20 years.After deleting her tweet, Curry explained that she’d reacted “in the heat of the moment.” She said that an earlier incident with her dad had further fueled her frustration. According to ESPN, NBA security confused Curry's father with another man -- a con artist who had previously snuck into major sporting events. Curry's dad was reportedly threatened with arrest before officials realized their mistake.Curry also complained about being prevented from entering the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland until 9 p.m., when the game was scheduled to start. Per ESPN, the delay may have been caused by traffic congestion.Reacting to his wife's Twitter comments, Steph Curry said it had been ""an emotional and tough night all the way around.""""When it comes to Twitter and all that, everybody says stuff where you get caught in the moment,"" Steph Curry told The Undefeated. ""After a while, you kind of stand and calm down. Things might not be as you thought. ... I don't fault her from showing some emotion on Twitter.""The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Warriors 115-101. The Warriors will host the Cavs for Game 7 on Sunday."

John McCain set off a furor when he blamed President Barack Obama for the Orlando shooting.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576443871500002b0073b335.jpeg?cache=QQED9cg4MH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. John McCain's (R-Ariz.) claim that President Barack Obama is to blame for the Orlando, Florida, massacre is turning into a fund-raising boon for his Democratic challenger, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick.McCain told reporters Thursday that Obama was ""directly responsible"" for the shooting, then released a statement saying he ""misspoke"" and meant to say Obama's policies are to blame, not the president himself. McCain explained that he believes Obama is responsible for the growth of the Islamic State -- to which the Orlando shooter pledged allegiance -- because of the way Obama ended the Iraq war and because McCain thinks Obama has not responded aggressively enough to the Syrian crisis.Regardless of his partial retraction, though, the veteran senator's words sparked outrage, moving people to open their wallets for Kirkpatrick. According to her campaign, at least $100,000 flooded into its accounts.""John McCain's reckless and appalling comments about the Orlando mass shooting disappointed thousands of Arizonans and people from across the nation,"" said Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell. ""But his actions are just further proof that after 33 years in Washington McCain has changed, and now Americans are witnessing that he's no longer a 'maverick.'""Arizonans know it's time for new principled leadership, and that's why Ann Kirkpatrick saw the largest one-day fundraising number of the campaign,"" Mitchell added.The spokesman's words echoed a fundraising appeal the campaign sent out Friday afternoon to capitalize further on McCain's misstep.""We need a senator who will put our national security before partisan politics,"" said the appeal to supporters. ""We must do everything we can to elect Ann to the Senate and we are asking you to make a donation today.""The McCain campaign did not immediately answer emails about the Kirkpatrick campaign's charges."

Dylann Roof, a self-declared white supremacist, later confessed to the heinous crime he now stands accused of -- which prosecutors describe as a calculated act of racially motivated terrorism. One year later, churchgoers and community members in Charleston have healed in some ways, but others argue that much is the same in a state with a past, and present, riddled with racism.Many mourners have traveled to the historical black church in the past year, commonly known as Mother Emanuel, to pray and pay tribute to those killed on that dreadful day. The victims were: Rev. Clementa Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Cynthia Hurd, Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Myra Thompson, Ethel Lance, Rev. Daniel Simmons, Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor and Susie Jackson.Rev. Dr. Betty Deas Clark, who knew Pinckney personally, took over the pulpit at Mother Emanuel in January. She says the experience so far has tested her resilience and strength, but both have helped her to overcome challenges as a leader in the church and community. “It’s been a whirlwind,” Clark said of her new role. “It’s been filled with moments of joy, moments of sadness. It’s stretched me as a leader. I guess I’m more compassionate now than I’ve ever been before.” Clark has expressed forgiveness of the accused killer's horrific acts of racial violence, as have other family members of those who died. However, while some have found forgiveness to be a helpful measure in healing, others say moving forward will require much more than mercy. Bree Newsome, the black activist who scaled the pole outside of the South Carolina statehouse and temporarily removed the Confederate flag weeks after the massacre, believes that true peace and healing will only occur after the state addresses and resolves its ongoing racial issues.“We can’t talk about healing until we really talk about the underlying racial issues, issues of system racism, the racism that was endorsed by the state by the simple fact that the Confederate flag was raised,” Newsome told The Huffington Post. “Yes, we need to heal. Yes, peace itself is a cause worth advocating for, but there is no peace in the absence of justice.” “There’s no real peace, there’s just order,” she added. “Peace is about justice.” Charleston’s racial history runs deep. The “Holy City” was once home to one of the state’s primary slave ports, where beaten and bruised black bodies were auctioned off to white owners. Yet while the days of slavery are long gone, racism still persists throughout the town. The consequences of slavery are exposed through the systemic ways that Charleston’s black population remains disadvantaged, as well as through tragedies like the massacre at Mother Emanuel because of racial hatred.“It’s important that we make sure that what happened in Charleston is placed in it’s proper context,” Newsome said. “We’re talking about dynamics in 2016 that have its roots in chattel slavery. The whole economy in Charleston, the tourism, is built on the glamorization of this process. There’s a lot of deep racism and the same economic and racial issues exist today.” Douglas Birdsall, a white Christian leader based in Boston, Massachusetts, understands this reality, too. As the founder of the Civiltas group, a coalition of church, school and media leaders, Birdsall is committed to help bring racial unity in churches and communities everywhere. “Honestly speaking, the church has too often ignored its own teaching and betrayed our faith,” he told HuffPost. “We have too often been silent, and in too many cases have been complicit, in the history of slavery and in the ongoing practices of discrimination and racism. This is a shameful reality.”Birdsall and a team of other pastors launched a call to action in response to Charleston's mass shooting last year, asking Christian leaders to stand in solidarity with the city and work towards restoration. He flew to Charleston on Thursday to host a commemorative anniversary dinner and speak to the community about ways to achieve racial healing and reconciliation. “If we are going to come to terms with this, we must be honest with our own history in this country,” Birdsall said. “My hope is that people will leave Charleston with a spirit of hopefulness. Hopelessness is the enemy of creativity, justice and constructive engagement.” At the dinner that Civilitas hosted, church leaders from across the country expressed the need to bridge the gap between black and white communities. “Civilitas gives you the opportunity to connect,” said Rev. Mark Whitlock, a black pastor from California. “It’s a way to share that [the black and white community] are both complicit, that we both have challenges on each side, but we need to come together. Maybe it begins with dinner, and then worship.”Maybe if Roof had been educated on the challenges and celebrations of Mother Emanuel churchgoers, he would have had less hate in his heart, Whitlock said.While there’s been a greater awareness that South Carolina, and the nation as a whole, is still “nowhere near post-racial,” there needs to be more tangible action, said Rev. Joe Darby, vice president of Charleston's NAACP chapter.“These conversations are still kind of few and far between,” he said. “When it comes to the impact on things like causing patterns, gentrification, public education, there's minimal change. There’s been no difference in public policy. The governor took down the flag but still won’t support meaningful gun control legislation.” Gun control laws are again in the spotlight, after the massacre of 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando on Sunday. It remains to be seen what, if anything, politicians will do to stop the easy access to automatic assault weapons.For Clark, it was important to offer her support to those the Florida tragedy affected. So the Mother Emanuel pastor declined an invitation to attend the United States of Women’s Summit that Michelle Obama hosted at the White House on Tuesday and traveled to Florida to comfort the victims of Orlando’s tragedy instead.“Even though I would have been in the midst of some powerful women, there was a greater power that pulled me to go to Orlando,” Clark said at Thursday night’s dinner. She said she went to a counseling center, where victims still reeling from the violence sought comfort. She knew their pain all too well. She began to hug them.“The hug for me was an exchange,” she said. “I felt their pain, and I believe they felt my love. So I believe it was medicinal. They just needed someone to validate their pain, to walk with them. I was privileged and proud to do so.” That anguish is a feeling too many Americans experience entirely too frequently in connection to mass shootings like those in Charleston and Orlando. These tragedies serve as a constant reminder that racial hatred, homophobia and other bigotry still haunt us -- and that only through standing in solidarity are we better able to achieve progress. Clark took to the podium later that night in the ballroom of Belmond Charleston Place and conveyed this message, as she spoke about the power of faith to the sprinkled mass of black and white church leaders. “This room is filled with love,” she said. “It’s filled with people who care about people. And that’s my heartbeat: I care about people. And so, as the pastor of Mother Emanuel, I want to say thank you for caring so much about us. To come to the proverbial table, figure out what’s wrong, and what we can do to make it right. Because the God I love and the God you love -- the God I serve and the God you serve -- he’s not black, he’s not white, he’s nothing in between. He’s everything.”"

So my first introduction to anything style-wise was to watch my dad on Fridays dress up to go to work to drive a van around downtown to deliver boxes.Ten years ago, Dwyane Sr. founded the nonprofit ProPops Foundation, whose mission to ""empower fathers to be pillars within their children's lives.""And he passed on the importance of fatherhood to Dwyane, Jr. The NBA star, a father to two sons and a nephew, is on President Obama’s fatherhood task force.Join us in wishing them both a Happy Father's Day!"
42,BLACK VOICES,What We've Failed To Learn About Mass Shootings Fueled By Hate,Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-weve-failed-to-learn-about-mass-shootings-fueled-by-hate_us_5762b890e4b09c926cfe5e59,"One year after the Charleston shooting, America still hasn't faced its demons.",2016-06-17,"Elliot Rodger, Dylann Roof, Omar Mateen. Three mass shooters, fueled by hate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5762d22f1500002b0073ae9d.jpeg?cache=JxUceJqKmB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"June 17 marks the one-year anniversary of one of the worst mass shootings in America -- the Charleston church massacre. On that day, 21-year-old Dylann Roof sat with a bible study group at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. After a full hour of sitting with the group as they worshipped, he proceeded to pull out a gun and open fire on them, killing nine innocent people -- all of them African American. Later, we would find out in a manifesto published on Roof's website that the intention behind his heinous act was fueled by a deep hatred for black people. He expressed disgust at the thought of black men and white women together, claiming, ""you [black men] rape our women."" His desire was to spark a race war.A year after the massacre, a year after heated debates on gun control and mental health and most of all, race, we've now been plunged into yet another national conversation that rests at the intersection of horrific violence and hatred: the shooting in Orlando.But what have we actually learned? That's always the question when it comes to the cancer of gun violence and mass shootings that plague this country (and this world). What have we learned? How do we progress? How do we ensure that something like this never happens again? The answer, surely, lies in our policies surrounding guns, policies that currently in many states make it terrifyingly easy for citizens to legally purchase assault rifles. But the answer also lies in something we're seemingly unwilling to do in the United States: acknowledge, recognize and work through our national demons.The Charleston massacre was significant for a lot of reasons. It was just days before Juneteenth (the annual celebration of the end of slavery in the Americas), at a church that played an integral role in the Civil Rights movement. It also happened during what seemed like a racial boiling point in America.In April, Walter Scott, unarmed, was shot and killed from behind in South Carolina while fleeing from a police officer -- the circumstances of his death only came to light when a video taken by a bystander eventually surfaced. In May, the state of emergency had been lifted in Baltimore, where protests surrounding the death of Freddie Gray had filled the streets. Police brutality and the #BlackLivesMatter movement were both at the forefront of the country's collective mind.With all this tension around race in the atmosphere, what happened in Charleston was as much about the senseless destruction caused by gun violence as it was about the senseless destruction caused by racism. Roof was a radical manifestation of our race problem, a potent reminder that white supremacy and white rage are not anomalies -- they're worked into the very fabric of this country. The more we ignore them, the more we allow them to grow, just beneath the surface.The homophobia of Omar Mateen, the shooter behind the terrorism at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, is also just beneath the surface in this country. There's been a lot of debate about whether Mateen's attack was fueled by ""radical Islam"" or homophobia, but whatever his alliances, it is clear Mateen sought out LGBT victims to kill in an LGBT space. And his disgust also festers in this country, a country where one week a person can say that trans people should ""go pee in the bushes"" instead of public restrooms, and weeks later share their condolences to the LGBT people affected by the shooting. Therein lies the blinding hypocrisy of our horror at these violent incidents.And let us not forget when 22-year-old Elliot Rodger killed six people in Isla Vista, California, back in May 2014. He, too, exposed a sense of entitlement and hatred for women that's very much a part of our society. The display of his hatred may have been extreme, but the hatred itself was not exclusive to him. He chose a mass shooting to express his anger at rejection, at women not freely allowing him access to their bodies. It's a type of anger that's expressed through physical and sexual violence against women every day. And that's the thing. These shootings are reminders of the reality of these isms (homophobia, racism, sexism) in our everyday lives. The Charleston shooting laid bare a reality of this country in a brutal, raw way. But the deaths of Freddie Gray, Mike Brown, Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, the deaths of the nine innocent people at Mother Emmanuel Church, the violent and senseless deaths of countless black people across this country and across the centuries all lie on a continuum. They are not separate. They are echoes of each other. Charleston, Isla Vista, Orlando. As tempting as it is to dismiss these mass shooters as maniacs (and of course, in a sense, they are), we have to recognize that they hold ideals that many Americans, behind closed doors, share. Of course, not every mass shooting in America has been fueled by an ism. But what we can learn from the common thread that link these specific incidents is that violence manifests itself in many ways. It can be explicit or it can be subtle, but all violence makes an impact, and leaves a scar.One year after Charleston and days after Orlando, here's what we need to learn: these mass shootings are the extreme demonstrations of hate, yes. But every time someone turns away in disgust at a gay couple kissing, misgenders a trans person, harasses a woman on the street, or questions the concept of ""black lives matter,"" it's a subtle violence, a contribution to the kind of hate that explodes across the 24-hour news cycle in the form of another mass shooting. It's time we accept that, so we can truly move forward. "
