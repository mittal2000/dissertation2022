0,POLITICS,City Leaders Say Police Unions Have Obstructed Stop-And-Frisk Reform,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stop-and-frisk_n_5991942.html,,2014-10-15,"NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 27: An opponent of the New York Police Departmentâs controversial 'stop-and-frisk' policy march on January 27, 2012 in the Bronx borough of New York City. The NYPD says the stops assist crime prevention while opponents say they involve racial profiling and civil rights abuses. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, during the first nine months of 2011 514,461 city residents were stopped by the NYPD. 451,469 were innocent (88 percent), while 54 percent were black, 31 percent Latino and 9 percent white. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d9de1f000040022575fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- It’s a story Nicholas Peart has told many times. On his 18th birthday, he walked to a Brooklyn McDonald’s with his cousin and a friend. The McDonald’s was closed, so the trio sat down on a nearby bench and shot the breeze. They weren’t drinking, they weren’t smoking weed. They were just enjoying the summer night. Suddenly, three NYPD squad cars surrounded them, and an officer yelled at them to “get to the ground!” They obeyed. That’s when an officer, gun pointed at Peart, allegedly rooted through Peart's pockets, pulled out his wallet, then pulled out his ID. “Happy birthday,” the cop quipped. It was that incident -- along with nine other times he says cops stopped and searched him for no reason -- that spurred Peart, now 25, to join the class-action lawsuit against the police department’s use of stop, question and frisk. In 2011, the NYPD stopped New Yorkers nearly 700,000 times, and 87 percent of those stopped were black or Latino. Last summer, Judge Shira Scheindlin delivered a landmark decision in that class-action lawsuit, Floyd vs. The City of New York. She ruled that the department’s use of the controversial tactic was unconstitutional, and amounted to an “indirect policy of racial profiling.” She ordered a federal monitor to oversee the NYPD, and also ordered a slew of other remedies, including a “joint remedial process” in which the plaintiffs and advocacy groups would have to work together to repair police-community relations, and a pilot program for putting body cameras on cops. A series of legal maneuvers from the city’s police unions, however, have stalled the implementation of these remedies.“It’s important that the remedies move forward,” Peart told reporters Wednesday during a rally outside the United States Court of Appeals in Lower Manhattan, where the police unions were set to argue in the Floyd case that they should be able to intervene in the implementation of the remedies. “For too long, stop-and-frisk has been plaguing our communities, and we’re ready for change,” Peart said, flanked by members of different advocacy groups, as well as a handful of New York lawmakers. Public Advocate Letitia James said it was time to “enact justice for communities that have been affected by stop-and-frisk abuses.” “What we‘re fighting for today,” she continued, “is the future of the joint remedial process and stop-and-frisk reform in New York City at the center of the healing process between law enforcement and communities of color all throughout the city.""She also said the unions’ decision to stall the Floyd ruling was really just a maneuver in ongoing contract negotiations with the city. “I believe that this is nothing more than a ruse, an excuse for negotiations related with the labor contract which is at dispute right now with [Mayor Bill de Blasio's] administration,” she said. “I think they are using tactics to get the attention of the administration to stall any efforts at progress.” The unions’ main objection to the Floyd decision has been that officers themselves wouldn’t be involved in the joint remedial process, but attorney Jonathan Moore told The Daily News in July that Scheindlin’s ruling ""gives the unions a seat at the table.""Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union, told The Huffington Post in a statement Wednesday that “our challenge has always been about protecting the rights and safety of our members while they work to protect our communities.” “We have serious concerns about how these remedies will impact our members and the ability to do their jobs,” he continued. “The PBA is fighting to give voice to our members and to make every effort to ensure that their rights are protected.”Moore, however, pointed to the fact that some cops testified against the department’s use of stop-and-frisk during the Floyd trial. “I don’t think these police unions are speaking for the majority of police officers, because the rank-and-file officers want this reform,” Moore said. “We have a leadership in this city now that has a greater respect for civil rights,” Moore added, referring to de Blasio’s administration, “after 20 years of living in the desert under Giuliani and Bloomberg. I think there’s a new day in this city on some level, and we want a union leadership that reflects that change. And at this point all they reflect is the old way of doing things, which is, ‘Policemen can never do anything wrong.’”“Had these reforms been implemented, it’s very likely that Eric Garner would not have died on Staten Island three months ago,” Moore continued. Garner, 47, died after police put him into a prohibited chokehold during an arrest for selling untaxed cigarettes. Moore, who now represents Garner’s family in a lawsuit against the city, said the 120th precinct in Staten Island would’ve been one of the precincts to have received body cameras as a result of the Floyd ruling. “Had those cameras been implemented and officers been trained with them, I think it’s a fair assumption to say that they would not have acted the way they did,"" Moore said. “In this case, justice delayed is not only justice denied, it’s people being killed.” After Scheindlin’s ruling last year, Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed the decision. An appeals court later removed Scheindlin from the case altogether, but in January of this year, de Blasio took office, dropped Bloomberg’s appeal, and used Scheindlin’s ruling as a basis for a sweeping settlement to reform the NYPD’s use of stop-and-frisk. In July, another federal judge blocked police unions from intervening in that settlement. The unions appealed that decision, which resulted in Wednesday’s hearing before another panel of federal judges. Meanwhile, the number of police stops has continued to drop dramatically under de Blasio. There have been only 27,527 stops so far this year, a steep decline from the nearly 700,000 such stops in 2011. In two Brooklyn precincts where the tactic was the especially prevalent, the number of police stops has dropped a staggering 99 percent. For Peart, however, numbers can be deceiving. “Just because the numbers are down,” he said Wednesday, “doesn’t mean it’s not happening.” "
1,POLITICS,McConnell Claims To Have 'Shocking' Video Proving Grimes Is Lying. He Doesn't.,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-ad_n_5992012.html,,2014-10-15,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, testifies during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, June 3, 2014. The U.S. Senates top party leaders clashed at an unusual Judiciary Committee hearing over a proposed constitutional amendment that would give Congress more authority to regulate federal campaign spending. Photographer: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d9df2100004202c96686.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org.Sen. Mitch McConnell claims in a TV ad to have “shocking” video evidence from Alison Lundergan Grimes’ “own staff” to prove “Grimes is lying” about her support for coal. He doesn’t.The ad cites an Oct. 6 article in the Free Beacon about the videos, but the original source is James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas Action Fund. O’Keefe, a conservative activist, surreptitiously videotaped Grimes supporters saying the Democratic candidate doesn’t actually support the coal industry. But none of those featured in the ad is a paid staffer with the Grimes campaign, and all of them are expressing their personal opinions — not revealing campaign strategy.Genuine support for the coal industry has been a hotly contested issue in the Kentucky Senate race. Both candidates have been outspoken in support of coal, and against Obama administration regulations of it, but both sides have accused the other of simply paying lip service to the issue.The new ad from McConnell’s campaign suggests it has a smoking gun with comments from Grimes’ “own staff.” The campaign doesn’t.“Why do radical anti-coal activists support Alison Grimes, even as Grimes claims to support coal? Now we know,” the ad’s narrator says. “Shocking new undercover videos with Grimes’ own staff and donors show Grimes is lying, only praising coal to win an election.”The ad then cuts to an undercover video of Roz Hines saying, “She’s saying something positive about coal because she wants to be elected.” But Hines isn’t a Grimes campaign staffer. She’s a volunteer with the Fayette County Democratic Party.The Project Veritas video also includes another volunteer with the Fayette County Democratic Party, Gina Bess — not featured in the McConnell ad– who says that market forces, more than any EPA regulations, have led to the decline of the coal industry. “But,” she says, “you really can’t say that in Kentucky, which is so stupid, because there are too many people who would go, ‘Coal is our livelihood.’ ” Bess is then asked if she thinks that if Grimes is elected, she’d “do the right thing and wipe out that coal industry and go for better resources.” Bess responds, “I absolutely think she is.”But Bess isn’t a Grimes campaign staffer either.Bob Layton, chair of the Fayette County Democratic Party, told us in a phone interview that both Hines and Bess are “100 percent volunteers with the Fayette County Democratic Party.” While both support Grimes’ candidacy, he said, “I am certain they are not a part of the Grimes campaign, and I am certain they have never been to any Grimes campaign staff meetings.” Layton said the videos were shot surreptitiously in the Fayette County Democratic Party offices without its consent.The McConnell ad also shows a Grimes donor, Niko Elmaleh, saying, “she’s going to *** [coal companies] as soon as she gets elected. Take my word for it.” That comes from a second Project Veritas video. Records show Elmaleh donated $2,600 to the Grimes campaign on June 23, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Elmaleh, who is in real estate, is certainly entitled to his opinion. But that’s all it is: his opinion.Others quoted in the Project Veritas videos include members of the Warren County Democratic Party offices, a field organizer in the Louisville Democratic office, a former Kentucky auditor and Grimes supporter, and a Grimes campaign field organizer.The Grimes campaign said none of them is actually employed as a Grimes campaign staffer. We also checked records filed with the Federal Election Commission, and none of those featured in the Project Veritas video is listed on the campaign payroll.The Grimes campaign emailed a statement to FactCheck.org saying, “The sleazy video Mitch is himself peddling does not contain Alison’s staff, nor does it in any way represent her views.”We asked specifically about Chase Sanders, identified in the Project Veritas video as a Grimes campaign field organizer, who said Grimes is “trying to get votes in that sense from parts of Kentucky that that’s appealing to but once she gets in she’s going to be very realistic about the fact that there are environmental problems and she will do her part, in a sense, to support those things.”The Grimes campaign told us, however, that Sanders “does not work for the campaign.” Thomas Mann, a campaign expert for the Brookings Institution, said campaign field organizers have nothing to do with campaign strategy anyway. They focus on voter identification, canvassing and voter turnout.The Grimes campaign said it is “shameful and reeks of desperation” for McConnell to use the work of O’Keefe, “a convicted criminal – with a known history of manipulating and fabricating these videos.”O’Keefe rose to national prominence in 2009 after releasing a series of videos purporting to show employees at voter registration organization ACORN going along with illegal activities. In 2013, O’Keefe agreed to pay $100,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a former ACORN employee featured in one of O’Keefe’s videos who appeared to go along with O’Keefe’s make-believe scheme to smuggle underage girls into the U.S. to act as prostitutes. The man in the video actually called police shortly after O’Keefe left the office to report a potential crime.In 2010, O’Keefe was convicted of a misdemeanor charge after he and three other members of Project Veritas tried to finagle their way into Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu’s office. O’Keefe pleaded guilty to entering federal property under false pretenses and was sentenced to three years of probation and 100 hours of community service, and fined $1,500.Also worth noting, a California attorney general’s report in 2010 on the ACORN videos concluded that unedited versions of the videos, in addition to showing “highly inappropriate” though not illegal behavior by ACORN employees, also revealed how some of the ACORN videos released by O’Keefe had been deceptively edited.And so we asked for raw, unedited videos from the interviews regarding Grimes. Stephen Gordon, a spokesman for Project Veritas Action Fund, told us via email that the group “does not release raw or unedited tapes or reporters’ notes of investigations. This policy ensures compliance with federal and state laws while providing the best privacy protection for individuals recorded.”“The reporting process and methods of Project Veritas Action are proven successful and effective and are the protected intellectual property and trade secrets of Project Veritas Action,” Gordon added. “This policy is in accordance with the practices of news organizations globally and is generally accepted as the professional norm.”Without the unedited versions, we can’t provide any further context to the comments featured in the Project Veritas videos. But even taking the videos at face value, what is shown on the Project Veritas videos, and in the McConnell ad, are the opinions of Grimes supporters. The videos are not, as the McConnell ad claims, evidence of “Grimes’ own staff” showing that “Grimes is lying, only praising coal to win an election.” Also, O’Keefe and the McConnell campaign accuse Grimes of lying without considering the possibility that the supporters shown in the video are just telling the undercover actors, who posed as liberals concerned about Grimes’ coal-friendly statements, what they think the actors want to hear.As we noted back in June when an ad accused Grimes of being “silent” as “Obama attacked coal,” Grimes has been vocal and consistent throughout her campaign about her opposition to Obama administration regulations on the coal industry."
2,POLITICS,Dark Money Concentrates In Small Number of Pivotal 2014 Races,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dark-money-2014_n_5991978.html,,2014-10-15,"LEXINGTON, KY - OCTOBER 13: Minority Leader U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R) prepares for his debate with Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D) on 'Kentucky Tonight' at the KET Network Center on October 13, 2014 in Lexington, Kentucky. Voters go to the polls on November 4, 2014. (Photo by Pablo Alcala-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d9de200000c70101d3fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As independent spending by nonprofit groups that fail to disclose their donors approaches $200 million in the 2014 midterm elections, it is increasingly evident that this spending is meant to influence only a handful of races.This dark money spending -- so-called because it is not covered by federal disclosure rules meant to inform the public of who is paying to influence their vote -- is heavily concentrated in the key Senate races that will determine which party controls the chamber in January. According to a review by The Huffington Post of campaign finance records collected by the Federal Election Commission, the Center for Responsive Politics and press releases and news reports regarding spending by these groups, the Senate races in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky and North Carolina account for nearly half of all dark money spent to target 2014 candidates.Overall, expenditures by groups not disclosing their donors has soared to at least $190 million in the 2014 campaign. The five Senate races with the most dark money have attracted $92.8 million of this total, while the top 10 Senate races account for $130 million. These amounts include express electoral advocacy calling for the election or defeat of a candidate, as well as issue-based advertising that touts or assails the record of a given candidate while stopping short of asking for viewers to vote for or against them.Disclosure opponents like to argue that dark money spending is just a drop in the bucket compared to the projected $5 billion cost of all federal races in 2014. But a more direct examination of the dark money spent in individual races shows how big of an impact this spending has had on the most important races of the cycle.Most notably, in each of these races, dark money has come almost exclusively to the aid of Republican Party candidates.With more than $32.6 million spent, the North Carolina Senate race has seen more dark money than any other federal election this cycle. Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) has been been the primary target, with no less than $29.2 million in dark money attacking her or boosting her Republican opponent, state Rep. Thom Tillis. This unsourced spending accounts for 49 percent of all independent spending on the race, and easily exceeds the $19.2 million Hagan has raised for her own campaign from the beginning of 2011 through the end of September.In Kentucky, Senate Leader Mitch McConnell (R), a forceful opponent of campaign finance disclosure, has been buoyed by more than $18 million in dark money. This amounts to 99 percent of all dark money spent in his race against Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky's secretary of state, and accounts for 57 percent of all non-party independent group spending in the race.The primary backer of McConnell's campaign has been a dark money group called the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition. The group has spent more than $12 million without disclosing a single donor. It is run by Steven Law, a former aide to McConnell and the head of Karl Rove's Crossroads groups. The Kentucky Opportunity Coalition has done nothing in 2013 or 2014 except tout McConnell's accomplishments and attack Grimes.Nonprofit groups like the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition are ostensibly formed to advocate for a social welfare purpose, such as a cleaner environment or -- depending on one's definition of social welfare -- lower tax rates for corporations and the wealthy. Such groups are not allowed to spend the majority of their time advocating for political candidates, although the case of the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition illustrates that this limitation is, at best, difficult to enforce.Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) has been targeted by $14.1 million in dark money attacks, or 85 percent of all undisclosed money spent in the campaign. The Colorado Senate race between Udall and Rep. Cory Gardner (R) is also one of a small handful where more than 50 percent of all non-party independent group spending has come in the form of dark money.Rounding out the top five races with the most dark money spent are the Arkansas contest pitting Sen. Mark Pryor (D) against Rep. Tom Cotton (R) and the Alaska race between Sen. Mark Begich (D) and Dan Sullivan (R), former commissioner of the state Department of Natural Resources. The Arkansas race has seen the influx of $13.5 million in dark money, with at least $10.4 million of that aimed at unseating Pryor.Begich is one of the few Democratic candidates to come close to receiving as much support from dark money as his Republican opponent. Total dark money in the Alaska race exceeds $11.7 million. Sullivan is backed by $6.6 million, while Begich is supported by $5.1 million in dark money.Not all dark money comes directly from nonprofits. In some cases, as in support of Begich in Alaska, nonprofits donate to super PACs, which are required to disclose their donors. These nonprofit contributions to supposedly transparent super PACs, however, simply offer dead-end disclosure. Take, for example, the pro-Begich Alaska Salmon PAC, which is funded entirely by the League of Conservation Voters and its affiliate in Alaska, or the super PAC of the National Association of Realtors, which is funded entirely by the parent nonprofit. In Arkansas' Senate race, Cotton has received the support of the Government Integrity Fund Action Network, a super PAC funded entirely by dark money nonprofits.The other major Senate races that have attracted large amounts of dark money include Iowa ($11.6 million), Louisiana ($8.3 million), Michigan ($7.4 million), Georgia ($5.6 million) and New Hampshire ($4.3 million).The biggest source of dark money in nearly all of these races has been the political network created by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. This constellation of groups, which includes Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, Concerned Veterans for America, Libre Initiative, American Energy Alliance and Generation Opportunity, has already spent a combined $52 million on advertising in both Senate and House races in 2014.Other big spenders include the conservative U.S. Chamber of Commerce, with more than $28 million in spending, and Rove's Crossroads GPS, with $26.2 million. There are a handful of dark money groups operating in support of Democratic Party candidates, although they're spending far less than their conservative counterparts. The League of Conservation Voters is the leading dark money group backing Democrats, with $13.5 million spent when including the group's contributions to the Alaska Salmon PAC. The environmental group has not been entirely partisan in its spending, as it also provided some support to Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine). The second most prolific Democratic Party dark money group, Patriot Majority USA, has spent just $8.5 million.Further vast expenditures of dark money are likely yet to come. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, independent spending increases dramatically in the final weeks of an election campaign. And on Wednesday, Americans for Prosperity released a suite of online advertisements calling on viewers to ""fire"" 11 different Democratic members of Congress. There is no word yet on how much this new salvo will cost."

I love hearing their little voices and watching them beam with pride as they become little readers!,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe46e2500003200375271.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In recent years, there have been a number of inspiring reports on non-verbal (i.e., non-speaking) children with autism displaying masterful language via reading and writing. One of the most recent appeared this summer in the recounting of a non-verbal autistic teen who, with the assistance of technology, gave the graduation speech at his school.These children are in the news because, in today's world, their achievements are unique. The common assumption is that the absence of speech is a sign that language is beyond reach. Any exception to this assumption becomes headline material. The students are presented as extraordinary individuals with amazing talents that go beyond the norm.But what if this assumption is not valid? What if most, if not all non-verbal children could learn to read and write and are not doing so simply because they have not been taught? This question has not received the attention it merits. The developmental sequence in neuro-typical children is that spoken language appears well before written language. This has led to the conclusion that if children do not speak, they are simply not ready for literacy. Typically efforts that are made focus on what is termed ""emergent literacy"" -- meaning the initial behaviors of reading and writing that are deemed to lead to conventional literacy. For example, looking at a picture book, scribbling, etc.Many children fall into the category of being non-verbal. Though exact figures are not available, the estimates are that about half of children with autism either do not speak or are limited to one and two word phrases. Guided by the assumption outlined above, schools do not put forth major effort in teaching literacy to these students. Years of instruction are spent on isolated reading related skills such as writing one's name, learning signs relevant to the routines of the classroom, and mastering a few sight words. But the vast majority of these children are never given the possibility to achieve the language attained by those who make the headlines.It is important to recognize that the ones who have made the headlines such Carly and Ido started on their path largely via home instruction where the parents recognized signs that far more language was present in their children than they had been led to believe. They also did not use traditional reading instruction and so were able to transcend the assumptions guiding the educational system and use technology to give their children the opportunity to become competent language users. Can this development become widespread? Research shows that it can -- but only if we have solid, comprehensive software programs that carry out, in a systematic manner, what these parents have done ""instinctively"" on their own. A study recently completed at Columbia University -- using a program of this sort that I developed - has supported the value of this approach. (Additional information is available here.)There have been many critical junctures in our understanding of autism. We may now well be at another such juncture where literacy -- and hence, language, is made available to all. We will know that we have succeeded when the headlines about non-verbal children achieving literacy stop because it is no longer news and all children on the spectrum have mastered this vital skill."

The news received wide media attention, not just because of Mock's résumé but because of her gender identity as well. Mock is a professional writer who happens to be a trans woman. In the stories about her appointment, her gender identity and her new job were talked about in the same breath.Pro Journo talked with trans and intersex journalists about their perspectives on having a presence, voice and career in the media.Gaming journalist and trans woman Laura Kate Dale had mixed feelings on the coverage of Mock's hiring. ""It is positive that there is recognition and that we can say, 'Look, here is a good example,'"" she said. Mock is a positive and encouraging role model for the trans community. She is a well-known trans advocate, writer of the best-seller Redefining Realness, and creator of the hashtag #girlslikeus, and promotes trans women's empowerment. But alongside the positive aspects of promoting good practices, Dale saw a ""fixation from non-trans people to take one victory for the minority group of transgender people and holding it up, saying, 'Look, things are getting better for trans people because of one instance.'""A popular magazine hiring one transgender woman does not mean the whole industry is there yet. ""Many trans people keep telling us that they wish for more visibility, because they want people to be more accepting,"" said Jennie Kermode, chair of Trans Media Watch (TMW), a charity dedicated to improving coverage of trans and intersex issues by the British media. Banner at the 2013 Rally for Transgender Equality, Source: Ted Eytan / Flickr under Creative CommonsNegative attitudesTrans and intersex people still face challenges in their gender identity in today's media industry. For one thing, they have to deal with comments by the audience. Dale has personally experienced this. ""Being open about my gender identity has brought a lot more online abuse and harassment than if I would not have done so. At the same time, people also tell me they really appreciate what I do, as a lot of people in this industry do not talk about their gender identity,"" she said.An issue in the workplace is discrimination in employment. ""Trans people certainly worry that they are not getting certain jobs because they are trans,"" Kermode said. As an example, Kermode notes there are not many trans people working as TV reporters. ""Just as sexism limits opportunities for women, other kinds of prejudice limit opportunities for other minorities, like trans people. There is a tendency for people that go ahead as part of a certain social group. It is easier to get a job if you are in the same group as people who already have jobs in that organization--i.e., if you're a cisgender, able-bodied white man.""Labeled and limited""I think news organizations need to be bold and employ people on their merits. If you go on to a mainstream American channel, women tend to look very feminine and men masculine. Be open to people that look different to the stereotype,"" a trans correspondent told Student Reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity. He added, ""I've covered the London Olympics, worked in Libya and reported on Turkey during the earthquakes. Those are all really big stories. Who cares what I look like if there is a natural disaster that just happened?""This TV journalist wished to stay anonymous for many reasons. One is that he believes his journalistic work should be the story, and not himself. Coming out may result in media outlets offering him a job just to report exclusively or increasingly on trans gender issues. This is not something he wishes to pursue.""It is kind of, 'OK, you are the transgender person, so you are the best person to talk about these things,'"" he explained. ""I don't like the idea that the rest of the media industry feels like they don't need to learn about [transgender issues], to discuss them, research them or report on them, because 'that's somebody else's issue,'"" he said. ""I think any journalist worth his or her salt should be able to report on areas that aren't their immediate field of expertise. The information is out there. It is not rocket science.""Kermode agreed with this point, adding that the speed at which news is delivered nowadays is problematic. ""TMW worked with an online newsroom from a broadcasting company. Their people were allowed five minutes researching on the story and writing it down. Often journalists are not trained on transgender issues. They have to look for the facts in a short time, whereby they can easily make mistakes.""Besides the importance of accurate reporting, ""getting things right from the start is also a safety issue,"" Kermode explained. ""Information coming from television programs or news articles can encourage verbal and sometimes even physical abuse towards trans and intersex people."" TMW encourages all journalists to write about trans issues, providing training and a terminology guide to support those who wish to do so.Good example tends to be followedIntentionally or unintentionally, journalists educate and form public perceptions on gender identity. This can affect the way trans and intersex people are perceived. Dale believes that journalism should stimulate positive coverage of trans subjects and ""continue to get high-profile people to raise the voice of transgender people.""According to Kermode, media companies should take the initiative in employing onscreen trans and intersex journalists. ""Once viewers get used to it, they are completely fine with it,"" Kermode said. ""I'd like one's gender identity not to be an issue in the future.

Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed over a number of days with demonstrators demanding justice in the shooting death of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer on August 9th. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0057250000940037b06f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There have been too many police shootings this summer that have left black men dead or injured and our nation questioning the state of race relations.There was Michael Brown, the teen killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in August. That same month, John Crawford III was fatally shot by officers in an Ohio Wal-Mart as he carried an air rifle he'd picked off the shelf. And in September, Levar Jones was shot in the hip when a South Carolina state trooper opened fire on the unarmed man during a routine traffic stop.These incidents, which involved white officers, have rightfully sparked a national conversation about racial bias. But too often, such conversations focus solely on people consciously acting on their racial bias. This approach is a mistake. It oversimplifies the issue by portraying any act of bias as a conscious decision, the work of someone with overtly racist beliefs. That is not always the case.We live in a world filled with messages that teach and reinforce stereotypes and biases. Even if we disagree with these messages, we see them, we are aware of them and we absorb them.And, yes, we can be affected by them.Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Leonard Pitts has argued that the disturbing dashcam video showing Jones being shot isn't necessarily evidence of a trooper acting on a conscious racial bias against black people, but rather an implicit racial bias fueled by the pervasive stereotype of black men as dangerous predators. This is why the Within Our Lifetime Network's effort to raise awareness about implicit bias -- the subconscious bias we show toward others -- is so important. This network of groups, which includes the Southern Poverty Law Center, is encouraging people to take the online Implicit Association Test to uncover their implicit biases. Taking the test, encouraging others to take it and discussing the results is the first step to better understanding our own biases and acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of bias in others.Organizers of the effort, which launched today, also want people to raise awareness through social media and to plan activities to fight implicit bias.And it must be fought. You don't have to look far to see the tell-tale signs of implicit bias. When the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights released school discipline data earlier this year, there was a clear racial disparity that raised the specter of implicit bias in the classroom. For example, a black student is three times more likely to be suspended or expelled than a white student. And, although black students comprise only 16 percent of all student enrollment, they represent a staggering 31 percent of students ""subjected to a school-related arrest.""Even at the preschool level, black children represent 48 percent of those suspended more than once, but are only 18 percent of preschool enrollment. The statistics for students with disabilities are just as alarming. Students with disabilities represent one-quarter of the students arrested and referred to law enforcement despite being only 12 percent of all students.These sobering numbers are not meant to demonize educators. But they should encourage everyone to examine their implicit biases. Yes, it can be an uncomfortable task. But implicit bias is so deeply ingrained in our everyday lives, it's a task worth undertaking. Discovering these biases shouldn't make one feel ashamed or fearful that he or she is a racist. Uncovering implicit bias and guarding against it is a responsible and necessary step for anyone dedicated to eliminating bigotry and prejudice.It's time to put our commitment to a more inclusive and just world to the test by taking the test."

They don't shut up, they never give me a moment's peace, and I'm sick of it. My relentless OCD is the heinous b*tch behind it all. She's like a nagging, miserable old woman who refuses to cease her continuous pestering. She's not happy unless I'm worrying past the point of rational thought. She's not happy unless I'm repeating words, prayers, numbers to the point of exhaustion. She's not happy unless she has me believing that unless I do these things, my life will go to go to sh*t. I know she's wrong. I know she lies. I know she's a f*cking miserable old hag that will never be satisfied. I know I can't satisfy her, so then why do I listen? Why do I oblige her? Why do I feed the beast?Fear. Fear is the reason I feed the beast. I fear that if I don't comply with the beast, something bad will happen. I have a constant, crippling fear that the other shoe will drop. I have a constant, crippling fear that it will be my fault. My psyche is built on fear, superstition, and guilt -- all things that are unfounded, unrealistic, and unhealthy. These festering parasites' only purpose is to suck the soul from me and suck my happiness dry. There's no evidence to support my line of thinking; I know this. I know that this fear is irrational. I completely realize this fear has no point, no reason, and no shred of positive impact on my life. I hate it. I'm disgusted by the hold it has on me. The thought of it makes me physically ill; I feel nauseated over it. I don't want this fear to control my emotions, my thoughts, or my life.There is something that occasionally helps me snap me out of my ritualistic and pointless fear-based thinking, and that is doing. If I get up and move into action, I'm sometimes able to shake the webs my thoughts are attempting to entangle me in. This is why I love boxing and exercising so much; I just get up and do. During my work outs, the thoughts try to invade, but it's so much easier to fight them when I'm active. I'm able to avoid giving in to the rituals, at least temporarily. Rock climbing helps me, too. Once I get that harness on, I have to put my thoughts and energy into the wall I'm climbing. All of my focus has to channel into this one task, which allows me to disregard the the crowd of worries gathering on the periphery of my mind. Climbing forces me to keep going, keep fighting, keep looking up and moving forward.The sense of accomplishment and of conquering the crap that ensues fuels me with the motivation I want and need in my life. I want joy, peace, contentment, hope, and happiness to be my motivation, to be my source of thoughts and emotions. I need to keep building up this sense of conquering; I need to gather my fuel.

But the people of California and New York -- indeed of all of states -- are even more entitled to clean air and clean water.",2014-10-14,"LOST HILLS, CA - MARCH 24: Pump jacks are seen at dawn in an oil field over the Monterey Shale formation where gas and oil extraction using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is on the verge of a boom on March 24, 2014 near Lost Hills, California. Critics of fracking in California cite concerns over water usage and possible chemical pollution of ground water sources as California farmers are forced to leave unprecedented expanses of fields fallow in one of the worst droughts in California history. Concerns also include the possibility of earthquakes triggered by the fracking process which injects water, sand and various chemicals under high pressure into the ground to break the rock to release oil and gas for extraction though a well. The 800-mile-long San Andreas Fault runs north and south on the western side of the Monterey Formation in the Central Valley and is thought to be the most dangerous fault in the nation. Proponents of the fracking boom saying that the expansion of petroleum extraction is good for the economy and security by developing more domestic energy sources and increasing gas and oil exports. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15f692400005100554148.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Co-authored by Helen Slottje and Andy Hsia-CoronGreat movements -- from women's suffrage to civil rights -- begin with a small group of people standing up and saying no to injustice. Such a movement is currently emerging around our most basic human rights: access to clean air, clean water, and a stable climate. This new movement aims to halt aggressive oil and gas extraction techniques like fracking, which destroy water, pollute air, and leak climate-killing methane into the atmosphere. It's a grassroots effort that is spreading on both coasts of our great nation, and its momentum is growing as communities learn from the success of their neighbors and far-flung allies. Not long ago, the discovery of the natural gas-rich Marcellus Shale in the northeast prompted a rush from industry officials looking to secure gas leases in rural communities throughout New York, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Residents in small towns and villages were told that there was nothing they could do -- as long as there were willing property owners, wells would be ""fracked"" through the hard shale rock under their properties and natural gas would be extracted.New Yorkers quickly became alarmed about how fracking might change everything from the rural character of their communities to the safety of their water supplies. Rather than surrender to industry's insistence that fracking is an inevitability, neighbors banded together and successfully used the law to keep fracking out of their communities. This fight became even more urgent after Hurricane Sandy sent a tide of seawater into the New York City subway in 2012, and the consequences of climate change hit home.Similarly, here in California the discovery of oil inside of various shale formations has prompted a flurry of activity from energy companies looking to tap into this fossil fuel oil reserve. Residents in communities where extreme well stimulation techniques like fracking are used are rightfully concerned about air pollution and the contamination of their water supplies in a time of ruinous drought. They also wonder why we are fracking in a time of climate emergency -- especially when the latest study from Stanford University confirms what many suspect: climate change is the driver of California's historic drought. California communities are learning from the success in New York and are taking charge of their local water supplies and public health. They are banding together to encourage local elected officials to regulate land uses related to well stimulation and taking the issue directly to voters through the initiative process. Communities standing up to the oil industry include picturesque coastal areas like Santa Barbara and Mendocino counties and rural regions like San Benito and Butte counties. Everywhere citizen opponents to these techniques have organized, the oil industry has launched misinformation campaigns to confuse and mislead voters. Public records show that the industry has collected at least $3 million to oppose efforts to curtail well stimulation in communities around California.As local governments passed bans and moratoria on fracking throughout New York, the industry threatened lawsuit after lawsuit. But of 200 ordinances passed to limit or ban fracking in the state, only four ended up in court. And New York's highest court recently affirmed the right of communities to limit oil and gas development techniques like fracking locally.In many states -- including New York and California -- the oil and gas industry is regulated at the state level. But cities and counties retain the right to set zoning restrictions on land use. Despite the industry's bluster, communities have as much right in California as in New York to stop fracking and other forms of oil and gas development.Whether a community wants to protect groundwater from fracking-related pollution, air quality (and the climate) from emissions of methane associated with these practices, or public health from toxic chemicals used to drill, frack, and produce oil from deep reserves, the solution is the same: Stop fracking before it starts.The oil industry may feel entitled to its potential profits, and will likely fight efforts to curb extreme well stimulation and enhancement anywhere they appear. But the people of California and New York -- indeed of all of states -- are even more entitled to clean air and clean water. 2014 Goldman Prize recipient Helen Slottje is an attorney who led the legal effort in New York State to leverage land use law to pass local bans and moratoria on fracking. Sandra Steingraber, PhD, is a biologist and science advisor for Americans Against Fracking. Andy Hsia-Coron is a founding member of the Coalition to Protect San Benito, which is leading an initiative effort to ban fracking in that county."

And all will be well in the garden,"" Chance says. ""In the garden, growth has its seasons. First comes spring and summer, but then we have fall and winter. And then we get spring and summer again.""The President of the United States, among others, embraces these non sequiturs as supporting his Administration's policies. Chance soon becomes an important advisor.The movie was an adaptation of Jerzy Kosinkski's novel. It is dark, satirical, thought provoking and very funny. Chance, as realized by Sellers, is a classic comic character. Thomas L. Friedman is not trying to be funny.Until his recent opinion piece on ISIS, Friedman was the McDonald's of the New York Times Opinion Page. He serves up simple fare for millions, reliable and bland enough to be tolerated by babies. You wouldn't cater your wedding with fast food. You wouldn't rely on Friedman to provide in-depth analysis either. But when you're in a rush both can fill you up with a lot of empty calories.Friedman's most recent New York Times piece, however, isn't even that nutritious. In ""I.S. = Invasive Species,"" Friedman quotes an unnamed Iraqi official who told him that when members of the Islamic State occupied Mosul this summer, they marked the homes of Christians and those they deemed Muslim apostates with archaic words which are not indigenous to the region. ""I was intrigued by this story,"" Friedman writes, ""because it highlighted the degree to which ISIS operates just like an 'invasive species"" in the world of plants and animals. It is not native to either the Iraq or Syria eco-system."" Aware this might strike some as a strange leap of logic, Friedman explains: ""I find it useful at times to use the natural world to illuminate trends in geopolitics and globalization."" Clicking to the United States National Arboretum website, Friedman notes that invasive species can choke out native flora and fauna and alter the natural landscape.""I can't think of a better way to understand ISIS,"" Friedman writes, which is sad and probably true. Chance Gardner would have been proud.Comparing a band of murderers and psychopaths with anything in nature is not even wrong. It's nonsensical. Plants, as my new puppy has figured out, are not human beings. And he's not that smart a puppy. Plants, unlike people, behave without volition or intent, growing not for purposes of achieving political ends, but because DNA and the conditions of their environment determine they do so. The human beings who make up ISIS -- monstrous though they are, they do remain human -- are the products and producers of war, driven by innumerable complex and evil intentions, forged in a particularly gruesome geopolitical context. They seek a variety of ends through a series of unspeakably horrible means. To think of them as invasive plants -- and to credit the Obama Administration for treating them as such, as Friedman does -- is loopy.Friedman knows that but it doesn't stop him. On the contrary, it is what he always does. Take a complicated world issue, compare it to something simple, then draw what sounds like a meaningful truth from it.Thus, because everyone wants a Lexus but needs an olive tree emerging markets will succeed but only if sustainable. The world is flat, to some people, so those who know its round should behave accordingly. Earlier this year, the New York Observer -- admittedly no fan of the New York Times -- quoted an unnamed Times staffers who referred to Friedman as ""an embarrassment"" peddling ""blowhardy bullshit."" The Gawker's Hamilton Nolan, another competitor accused Friedman of traveling the world to find ""incredibly uninteresting platitudes"" called him a ""soothsaying simpleton."" Journalists, like all writers, are not immune to envy. Like McDonald's, Friedman makes a lot of money from his syndicated column, his many best-selling books, as well as from speaking engagements and television appearances.To which I say good for him. Why shouldn't he make a nice living?Friedman's success only bothers me because of what it says about those who employ and read him. As with Chance Gardner, the joke isn't on Friedman. It's on those who think what he's saying means anything.Shapiro, a former federal prosecutor and adjunct law professor at USC, is the author of the recent book Lawyers, Liars and The Art of Storytelling (ABA Publishing, October 2014)."

Throughout her long career, she focused on corn, examining the changes that occurred through generations of corn plants. Her research led her to conclude that genes ""jumped"" or were transposable. This was contrary to scientific thinking at the time (1950). The first woman to receive the Medal of Science (1975), her citation reads: ""For establishing the relations between inherited characters in plants and the detailed shapes of their chromosomes, and for showing that some genes are controlled by other genes within chromosomes."" Among her many honors, McClintock was the first recipient of a MacArthur Foundation grant and the first woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize (1983). She is pictured on a U.S. postage stamp and she has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. The recipient of the National Medal of Science ""For her ingenious experiments that led to new and surprising understanding of the decay of the radioactive nucleus,"" Chien-Shiung Wu proved the theory for which its two male developers received the Nobel Prize. Physicist Wu came to the U.S. for graduate studies in the 1940s and joined the Manhattan Project in 1944, to develop the atomic bomb.

Namely, it doesn't matter the language you speak, the color of your skin or what religion you believe in -- what matters is we should all consider each other as human beings and respect each other as such. This is a particularly important message for youth.Malala's message is being shared around the world this week as the international youth empowerment organization, Global Dignity, gears-up for Global Dignity Day with over 400,000 youth in 71 countries on Wednesday, October 15th, 2014.  A Facebook banner for Global Dignity's globally crowdsourced Less. More. campaign.Global Dignity's mandate is simple: In a day and age where there is so much conflict in the world (between cultures, religions, generations, socioeconomic classes, and more), there is a great need for broad agreement on something unifying, something that encourages and even grows a sense of community. That something is dignity.Global Dignity offers teachers, students and partners (such as Right To Play and TakingITGlobal, amongst others) all the material they need to host dignity workshops. During the workshops students are invited to discuss what dignity means to them and why it is important -- these range anywhere from 20 minute sessions to full-day, school-wide events -- such as the event I attended at Asker High School outside of Oslo, Norway.At these events, students are also invited to explore issues ranging from children's rights to racism, financial literacy or basic health, to name a few. What's more, given the widespread use of social media and text messaging, one of the most common themes being discussed is bullying, where at least half of teens worldwide have been bullied online in the last few years. According to the i-Safe Foundation and the Cyberbullying Research Centre 50 percent of young people have received threats via text or email, had mean or suggestive messages about them circulated or had hurtful or threatening posts on their social media accounts.This year, in an effort to reach youth about this particularly egregious issue, Global Dignity partnered with the new Canadian tech-startup, PlayMC2 (where, in addition to my role as the Canadian Chair for Global Dignity, I am the Co-Founder and CEO), in launching their first globally crowdsourced mobile campaign called: Less. More.The Less. More. Campaign Video, created pro bono by BBDO New YorkCreated pro bono by the award-winning New York-based ad agency, BBDO, Less. More. is designed to empower youth around the world to reduce digital and real-world negativity by tracking their dignity-related actions in real time. Through a variety of creative, emoticon-laden Facebook posts, tweets, posters and a video, Less. More. exposes some of the cruel and yet often subtle ways in which bullying is carried out - for example, when students use words like #sns (sorry not sorry) or #smh (shaking my head) to sarcastically make fun of someone. To this effect, Global Dignity is featuring a special dignity quest on PlayMC2, where students can crowdsource small acts of dignity. As an example of how the quest works to spread positivity, during a recent dignity workshop at Regina Street Public School in Ottawa, Canada, Global Dignity volunteers worked with Grade 3 to 6 students in crafting ""microactions,"" which are bite-size activities that are really easy to do and share.These dignity microactions included: ""Give a new friend a hug,"" and ""Give someone a high-five!,"" where students were invited to take a photo of themselves completing the task and could then share their microactions on social networks, tagged with #dignity. Within or outside a classroom setting, simple microactions such as these can be done by one student or by thousands simultaneously. Through this campaign, we're able to see the collective power inherent in sharing our small acts of dignity and the positive impact they have on our daily lives and those of others.

Global Dignity is an independent, non-profit, non-political organization focused on empowering young people with dignity and was established in 2005 by HRH Crown Prince Haakon of Norway, John Hope Bryant, Chairman and CEO of Operation HOPE and respected Finnish professor Pekka Himanen. Supported by leaders from around the world and across sectors, the Honorary Board of Global Dignity includes: Sir Richard Branson, President Martti Ahtisaari and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Ultimately, the power is in the palm of our hands to make the changes in the world that we want to see, and to spread Malala's message, beckoning youth to stand up and share their voices in an effort to recognize our global humanity.Promoting this message around the world this week, Global Dignity is inviting students and teachers everywhere to participate in the Less. More. campaign - and to share their acts of dignity with their family, friends and peers leading up to Global Dignity Day on October 15th and beyond -- so that everyday we can see the power that dignity brings to our lives. One microaction at a time.
