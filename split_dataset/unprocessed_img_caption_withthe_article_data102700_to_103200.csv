2,FIFTY,Why You Can Thank The Neanderthals For Your Retirement Plan,Ann Brenoff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/history-of-retirement_n_5960646.html,,2014-12-08,"A visitor looks at 'El Neandertal Emplumado', a scientificly based impression of the face of a Neanderthal who lived some 50,000 years ago by Italian scientist Fabio Fogliazza during the inauguration of the exhibition 'Cambio de Imagen' (Change of Image) at the Museum of Human Evolution in Burgos on June 10, 2014. AFP PHOTO / CESAR MANSO (Photo credit should read CESAR MANSO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb66ce32400003100984588.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," Ever wonder what cavemen did to afford retirement? Best we can tell -- since early man's principal occupation was basically his own survival -- most of them died on the job and didn't worry too much about retiring. The Neanderthals are known to have cared for sick community members (and we assume those too old for hunting) by sharing food with them. And thus the idea of providing retirement benefits in an organized way probably entered our DNA, said no responsible scientist ever. Truth is, the concept of an organized system of providing help to workers once they retire is a fairly modern idea. For the longest time, taking care of the elders in a community fell to family members (or tribe or clan or village). Our aging relatives lived with us and we nursed them until their deaths. It was what was expected of adult children, and one of the reasons why families were large.But as younger members of the family unit began to drift away and scatter to destinations far away, the realization dawned on our collective society that maybe we needed a better way to ensure the care of the post-working elderly. Here's a brief history of our retirement system:THE BIG THREE (& WE DON'T MEAN AUTO MAKERS)Modern-day retirement in the United States has three components: the government (Social Security), our employers (private pensions and 401ks) and private savings (IRAs and whatever we stash in our mattresses). All three have undergone massive changes in our lifetimes and there is no reason to think they won't continue to do so in the future.The Social Security Act was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Aug. 14, 1935. The present system of monthly payments began in January 1940 with Ida M. Fuller of Vermont to be the very first person in America to receive an old-age monthly benefit check. The amount? $22.54, which wouldn't begin to cover the cost of a daily lift ticket in her home state today (although if she was 80, they'd let her ski for free.) The average retired worker in 2014 will get $1,294 a month. The maximum that a worker who retires at age 66 can get from Social Security is $2,642. But workers who postpone tapping their Social Security benefits are given an extra 8 percent a year until age 70. That means a worker reaching age 70 in 2014 could get a monthly maximum of $3,425, according to the Social Security website.And Social Security may be one of those things, like BMWs, that we can thank German engineering for. The U.S. got the idea of giving the nation's workers some help in their older years from Germany. Germany was the first nation to adopt an old-age social insurance program in 1889, designed by Germany's then-Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. Ignore the myth about how Bismarck set 65 as the standard retirement age because that was how old he was. Germany initially set age 70 as the retirement age -- and Bismarck was 74 at the time. It was lowered to 65 in Germany in 1916; 18 years after Bismarck died.Cost of living allowances were first paid in 1975. Prior to this, benefits were increased irregularly by special acts of Congress. And yes, members of Congress contribute to Social Security, as does the President.In 2012, Social Security was about 35% of the aggregate total income for people aged 65 or older.  The way Social Security is structured -- today's workers are taxed and the money paid to today's retirees -- is at the core of the panic over whether the current demographic trend is a problem: There are more retirees about to collect benefits than there are younger workers to be taxed. And so the conversation about whether -- or when -- Social Security will run out of money is an important one. Opinions vary on the direness of the situation.But, with what some see as impending doom with Social Security, greater attention is being paid to our pensions -- the second largest component of our retirement income. Retirement pensions paid by private employers typically come in the form of a guaranteed life annuity. The government also maintains a pension plan for its workers. The amount of someone's pension is determined by the number of years employed by that company and the amount of salary received (generally the last five years of wages are considered.)Pensions were basically a (very nice) promise that your company would reward your decades of loyalty once you were too old to keep working. The problem, of course, is that the defined pension plan today feels more like something you'd find when you open a time capsule: a curious relic from the past that for the most part doesn't exist anymore. Private-sector pensions have largely disappeared for a number of reasons. It may not matter since many workers no longer stick around a company long enough to benefit from them anyway. But pensions began to bite the dust about 30 years ago, when large employers were looking to cut costs. They pointed to their rivals, domestic and abroad, who weren't strapped with paying workers' retirement costs and got creative about reducing their own obligations. The end result was that many companies abandoned the idea of pensions altogether and instead began offering 401(k) plans, which shifted the investment risk and most of the expense to workers. When first pitched, the idea of controlling your own retirement fate appealed to many workers. But as many quickly learned, the stock market is a volatile place and to the inexperienced investor, not always a great place to earn as you learn. We like to quote Warren Buffett on inexperienced investors: “If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.”As for the companies, the better ones provided a 3 percent match of dollars invested in their 401(k) plan -- and then left long-time employees with frozen pensions and offered new employees none at all.How have those 401(k)s fared? Not very well in their first big test: the recession. As U.S. News & World Report reported, ""For 401(k) plans to work well, individuals need to sign up, contribute a portion of each paycheck, appropriately invest their savings, and not take any money out of the plan prematurely."" Until 2007, 401(k) participants had been gradually improving upon each of these behaviors. That ended abruptly in the recession. Account balances dropped, we saved less and fewer people enrolled. There was more borrowing and early withdrawals as job losses forced people to use their retirement savings for everyday expenses. The third leg of retirement is our own savings. This is a party that many came late to. A nation of savers, we aren't -- although many are making great strides in this area as they see the sand in their work hour-glasses running out.The non-profit Employee Benefit Research Institute reported earlier this year that 36 percent of workers have less than $1,000 in savings and investments that could be used for retirement, not counting their primary residence or traditional pensions, and 60% of workers have less than $25,000. THE FUTURE OF RETIREMENT: NO RETIREMENT?A Gallup study from 2013 showed that the average age at which U.S. workers retire has increased four years over the past 20 years -- from 57 in 1993 to 61 in 2013. But three-quarters of that upward shift occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s, according to Gallup’s data.Gallup also found that workers’ expectations about when they would retire also shifted. In 1995, nearly half of working Americans – 49 percent – believed that they would retire before age 65, while 32 percent expected to retire at 65 and just 14 percent anticipated working past 65. Today, only 37 percent of workers say they will retire at age 65, while another 26 percent think they will work beyond that age. Only 26 percent envision early retirement -- before age 65.Gone too is workers' confidence that they will have enough money for a comfortable retirement. That was at record lows  between 2009 and 2013, although it increased in 2014, according to the EBRI. Eighteen percent are now very confident (up from 13 percent in 2013), while 37 percent are somewhat confident. Twenty-four percent are not at all confident. This increased confidence is observed almost exclusively among those with higher household income ($75,000 or above).So what does the future bode for the upcoming group of retirees? Working longer, living on less in retirement and hoping our kids also got the Neanderthal gene for showing kindness."

President Barack Obama and India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Tuesday that ""it is time to set a new agenda"" between their countries, addressing concerns that the world's two largest democracies have grown apart. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f34f240000300098ad4c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Works break through the boundaries of their own time,"" wrote the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin. ""They live in centuries, that is, in great time, and frequently (with great works always) their lives are more intense and fuller than are their lives within their own time."" Like other great religious works, the Bhagavad Gita has lived an especially full and intense life, from the time of its composition some two millennia ago right up to the present. In its latest incarnation, this work of classical India has become an item of high-level diplomatic exchange. During recent state visits, the new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, has presented translations of the Bhagavad Gita to the Chinese President Xi Jinping and to the Japanese Emperor Akihito. Then, in September, Modi brought a special edition of the Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi, covered in homespun khadi, to the United States, and gave it to President Obama at a White House dinner. But Modi did not return to India Gita-less. During his visit, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawai'i, the first practicing Hindu in the United States Congress, gave to Modi her personal copy of the Gita. This was the same copy, she noted, that she had kept with her when serving in Iraq, and on which she had taken her Congressional oath of office in 2013. What is going on with all the gifts of the Gita?The Bhagavad Gita took birth as part of a larger composition, the great Sanskrit poem Mahabharata. The battlefield discussion of Krishna and Arjuna, two central figures of the epic, at the onset of a cataclysmic war touched on central themes and tensions within the story. Krishna's teachings drew on ideas and disputes of classical India, restating and reformulating them into an innovative synthesis. In the course of their discussion, Krishna also revealed himself to be the Supreme God. The complexity of Krishna's message and his reconciliation of multiple religious pathways made the short work rich in significance and susceptible to multiple interpretations. His self-revelation as God gave the work special religious authority to some.Although a great work of religious literature speaks within and to its own time of composition, Bakhtin's statement emphasizes that it cannot be closed off in that epoch. Its fullness is revealed only in ""great time."" In its continuing life, the work comes to be enriched with new meanings and new relevance in new settings. Different aspects of the work may come to the fore. In medieval India new hearers and readers found ways that the work spoke to their concerns. For Vedanta commentators like Shankara and Ramanuja, the Gita addressed central theological debates. In the hands of the Maharashtrian bhakti poet Jnanadeva, Krishna's Sanskrit dialogue with Arjuna proliferated into a greatly expanded devotional Gita in vernacular Marathi. Later it traveled abroad. In 1785, the Gita became the first Sanskrit work translated into English, and it provoked widespread excitement among English Orientalists, German Romantics, and American Transcendentalists. Henry David Thoreau borrowed a copy from Ralph Waldo Emerson to read at Walden Pond.In colonial India of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, nationalist writers and political figures revisited the Gita. They promoted it as a central work of an emerging Indian national ethos. The new battlefield was the British Raj, and they found in it strong advocacy for engaged social and political action, karma yoga. The form that action should take, however, remained a point of heated contention. This is where Mohandas Gandhi comes into the picture.Among all leaders of the Indian independence movement, none were more devoted to the Bhagavad Gita than Gandhi. He called it his ""dictionary of daily reference"" and his ""mother."" He spoke and wrote widely on it throughout his career. But he also had an interpretive problem. In the course of the Gita Krishna persuades the reluctant warrior Arjuna to take part in a battle of cataclysmic proportions. He advocates violent warfare, as an instrument of divine will. Many Indian nationalists accepted the call of the Gita for righteous struggle, even it that might require violence. Among the devotees of this Gita was K. S. Hedgewar, founder of the Hindu nationalist organization, the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS), who saw the work as the basis for creating a more disciplined, masculine, aggressive Hindu community. Gandhi, by contrast, held no commitment more important than his principle of non-violence. The battlefield, Gandhi argued, must be taken as an interior one, where the forces of good and evil are locked in never-ending struggle. When Krishna tells Arjuna to fight, he is telling him to overcome any self-interested inclinations and to carry out his own righteous duty, Gandhi based his own authority as an interpreter of the Gita on his personal endeavor ""to enforce the meaning in my own conduct for an unbroken period of forty years."" Gandhi also claimed that the Gita was not a Hindu work, but rather one of ""pure ethics,"" which a person of any faith might read.In his ceremonial gift to Obama, Narendra Modi sought to align himself with the Gandhian side of the Bhagavad Gita. Along with the book, it was reported, the Indian Prime Minister presented the American President with a rare photograph of Martin Luther King Jr., laying a garland at the cremation site of Gandhi, the Raj Ghat in Delhi. In 1959, King visited India to learn what he could from Gandhi's followers, and the strategy of the American Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and early 1960s drew heavily from the Gandhian practice of satyagraha, or disciplined non-violent resistance, developed in South Africa and India. To complete the circle, Obama and Modi had themselves photographed visiting the new Martin Luther King Junior Memorial in Washington.All this was adept deployment of the Gita in political rhetoric by Narendra Modi. Siding with Gandhi's interpretation of the Gita allowed him to place India on the moral high ground of non-violence. Following the guiding philosophy of the Buddha and of Gandhi, Modi asserted, ""we believe in non-violence."" And by bringing King into the picture, Modi was able to highlight the intertwined threads of dialogue that tie together the two post-colonial nations: the Bhagavad Gita, Thoreau's civil disobedience, Gandhi's satyagraha, and King's dream.Astute diplomatic symbolism aside, the larger question is which Bhagavad Gita will prevail during the Modi Raj. The Prime Minister's personal background leads back to the Gita of RSS founder Hedgewar, who read the work as a conservative, exclusivist, Hindu work. Modi is a long-time member of the RSS and leads a conservative Hindu nationalist party. During his time as Chief Minister of Gujarat, he presided over horrific communal riots in 2002, and many accused him of abetting an anti-Muslim pogrom. But the past is not destiny. If he were now to embrace Gandhi's non-violent and non-sectarian reading of the Gita, more than simply giving it away in other countries, one can imagine a different style of governance altogether. This remains to be seen. Whichever reading prevails, though, the long-ago battlefield dialogue of Krishna and Arjuna recorded in the Bhagavad Gita is sure to live on intensely in the political discourse of contemporary India."

Trundle down to the local cineplex and you can enjoy a brief history of iconic physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. If your stamina is adequate, you can also savor the tormented life of mathematician Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, a compelling film about the efforts to break German codes during the Second World War.Both men can be rightfully described as geniuses, and therefore by definition are highly exceptional. Stories about exceptional people have always titillated the public, as recognized by writers from Shakespeare to People Magazine. But Turing and Hawking are scientists, and as stars in movies they're as uncommon as Swiss admirals. That's particularly true in America where, with our rough-and-tumble frontier past, we generally prefer the broad-shouldered to the brainy.So as a researcher myself, I'm naturally pleased to see practitioners of science nailing lead roles in these well-made, popular films. It's a definite improvement over the time, almost yesterday, when scientists were bumbling accessories to the plot, and invariably unattractive, socially primitive, and obliged to wear white lab coats to every occasion.Both of these brilliant Britons suffer massive personal challenges -- and that makes for interesting characters. But the larger story is what these prodigies bring to the table at which the rest of us sit. In the newer of these film, The Imitation Game, Turing's task is no less than changing the course of war. He joins a small group of academics recruited for the Government Code and Cypher School (a clumsy name requiring two lines on the rugby jerseys). They've been brought together to break the codes used by the Nazi military, encrypted by a machine known as Enigma.Enigma, originally developed during World War I, is said to be as impregnable as the Titanic, and indeed its combination of wheels and cable jacks allow it to generate between one and a thousand billion billion different codes, depending on the model you buy. That latter figure is comparable to the number of grains of dry sand on all the beaches of Earth.Traditional cryptographic analysis isn't going to work anytime soon, and Turing opts to unravel the Engima codes by building a machine based on a Polish invention known as a ""bombe,"" an electromechanical computer. In the film, other members of his group are unconvinced by Turing's calculated approach, but the facts are, he can do without those guys. However, they can't do without him, and that's because Turing is smarter. He's a five sigma event. And indeed, this film bends its knee at what I call the five sigma theory of human progress. Now before you wince at the Greek, think back to that statistics course you took in college (or not). In statistics, a five sigma event is something incredibly unusual. A canonical example can be found in the statistics of human IQ. By definition, average IQ is 100. The standard deviation -- a measure of the spread of this value -- is about 15 IQ points. Roughly 68 percent of the population will fall between plus and minus one sigma from the average. In other words, two-thirds of the folks in a random sample of Homo sapiens will have IQs between 85 and 115, and 95 percent will have IQs within two sigma of the mean. If you have a three-sigma intellect (IQ of 145, on the positive side of the mean) you can rightly put ""exceptionally clever"" on your business card. You're one in many hundred, and probably the envy of the lout in the next cube.But at five sigma, you humble 99.99997 percent of the population. When it came to mathematics -- particularly the mathematics of computation -- Alan Turing was a five sigma event.You could argue that, when all is said and done, it is the five sigma people who make the big advances. Consider an example from another discipline, music. There have been thousands and thousands of composers since musical notation gave durability to the work of these creative tunesmiths. But a millennium from now, most of their stuff will be unplayed and unremembered. Not so for five sigma composers like Beethoven, Mozart or the Beatles. The truly exceptional matter. And the situation is similar for other artists and the practitioners of any field from philosophy to physics.This may explain our deep attraction to the brilliant outliers who, in the words of the Turing film, can do things no one can imagine. But the brutal flip side of this reductionist idea is the implication that if you're not at the five sigma level, your efforts, while admirable and even useful, will never be fodder for future memory or future textbooks -- that most of us are no more than worker bees. Essential and functional, yes. But transformative, no. We are merely plug-and-play parts in the machine.That's simultaneously discouraging and myopic. In truth, there are millions and millions of things that humans do, and that means that most of us are five sigma practitioners at something, even if it's only caring for our garden or our cats. The real human story isn't the lone runner, it's the race. Fifty thousand people participated in the New York Marathon this year. No doubt only a handful thought they had a chance of coming in first. But they still showed up. We don't all have to be five sigma events in the arts or sciences. The name of the game isn't ""winner"" -- it's ""game."""

But he noted recent gains had given Iraqi and Kurdish forces new momentum.Terry declined to say which countries would contribute the roughly 1,500 troops -- the final number was still being determined -- but added most would be involved with training.He said the troops would represent a broad mix from a anti-Islamic State coalition that, on the military side, now included nearly 40 countries. The U.S.-led coalition has also carried out air strikes in Iraq since August.Asked about Obama's critics in Washington who say more U.S. forces are needed, Terry said: ""I'm comfortable with the boots on the ground that I have right now.""

But the pair struck an optimistic tone in the face of withering criticism since The New Republic's top two editors resigned Thursday and more than 50 others followed them off the masthead Friday. The criticism hasn't abated, with Dana Milbank, a former New Republic staffer and current Washington Post columnist, blasting Hughes on Monday as a ""dilettante and a fraud"" who has killed the magazine. Hughes and Vidra suggested Monday that the obituaries are premature. Vidra said the institution and its values are ""stronger than any one group of people."" Hughes, echoing Vidra in later interview, said the ""place is bigger than any one of us."" Hughes also said the magazine -- which won't be printing again until February -- is now hiring and will ""emerge from this"" in time. Still, each expressed some regrets over the handling of the leadership change and their communication with staff. Vidra, a former Yahoo News executive appointed The New Republic's first CEO, became a polarizing figure on his 11th day in the office. Sources told this reporter –- and a few others -– that Vidra seemed more culturally suited to Silicon Valley than the editorial offices of a politics and culture magazine. In the meeting, he spoke of digital disruption and the need to ""break shit"" in order to change things. That sentiment, and Vidra's personal style, seemed a significant departure from Hughes' first meeting in 2012, when he promised to uphold tradition and preserve long-form journalism. In an interview, Vidra acknowledged his remark was unfortunate and said he made a mistake in ""not acknowledging enough how much the traditions of the institution matter to me."" Vidra said his intention was to get staff to ""embrace the idea that there is a tremendous audience out there and we need to try new things to reach that audience effectively.""""I was trying to focus more on getting people excited about what was to come and, sadly, it was misinterpreted,"" he said. Vidra said he ""had every hope and expectation to work with editorial leadership,"" but eventually ""it became clear there was not a sharing of vision when it came to digital.""While some internal tensions were evident at The New Republic's centennial gala in late November, the implosion didn't come until last week. Frank Foer, who returned as editor in May 2012, and Leon Wieseltier, the magazine's literary editor for the past three decades, both resigned. Most of the magazine's senior editors and staff critics followed the next day, along with nearly three dozen contributing editors, a largely honorary title given to former staffers and others associated with the magazine. Management also announced that print frequency would drop from 20 to 10 issues a year, and that the magazine's base of operations would relocate to New York from Washington, D.C.Hughes and Vidra announced Friday that Gabriel Snyder, who previously ran Gawker and The Wire and had most recently been creating new digital products for Bloomberg Media, would become the magazine's editor. They'd initially talked to Snyder about a senior digital position, but last week decided to offer him the top job. Snyder had already tried recruiting some writers, and so news trickled out before management had spoken to Foer, who learned from outside sources that he was being replaced. Hughes said he would have preferred to have spoken to Foer face to face, but since that news had circulated, he only did so over the phone. Staffers loyal to Foer were angered by management's treatment of him. Shortly thereafter, Vidra wrote in a separate staff memo that they were repositioning The New Republic as a ""vertically integrated digital media company,"" a description that's been mocked by a number of journalists on Twitter. On Monday, Vidra explained that he meant the company should have more in-house initiatives and outsource less. For instance, Vidra said he hoped to build a CMS (content management system) for publishing stories that would bring editors together with engineers and designers, as Vox had done. He also said the magazine had outsourced some advertising on the site, which he felt was ineffective. The New Republic, he said, needs the infrastructure to leverage its journalism in order ""to get the audience it deserves.""Hughes wrote Sunday in a Washington Post op-ed that he's trying to build a sustainable business to maintain The New Republic's ""journalism, values and voice.""Hughes, who reportedly made $700 million through Facebook, surely has the personal resources to hire journalists who aren't loyal to the old regime. But it's less clear how the magazine's ""values"" and ""voice"" carry on after many of its best-known writers, some with decades of experience and deep institutional memory, have gone. Or how those things can be preserved as a magazine long rooted in Washington's political and media culture transforms into a primarily digital, New York-based operation, any more effectively than if Hughes had simply started an entirely new site. Though not against new media startups, Hughes said they ""shouldn't come at the expense of places that have been around a hundred years and have traditions that are important and values that I personally share."" Hughes said he bought The New Republic and intends to continue investing in it, because he believes that ""institutions matter."""

Without good health we aren't much good to our families, our employees, or our communities. There are the obvious daily habits such as diet, exercise, and social activities that ensure good health, but what about the things we don't always think about? The less obvious areas of impact on our health include our homes, offices, and the built environment around us.Healthy Homes  Homeowners are starting to place health high on the priority list when looking at real estate investments. Families are looking for long-term healthy options. As a society we now have a better understanding of the impact that our homes have on our wellbeing. Our homes are where are stories begin and end so quality of life is essential in creating a healthy living environment.  Image via DelosLiving.comWe now have ways to measure the health of our built environment. We're also better equipped to make important shifts in our attitudes and actions in having more control over our built environments. Thanks to leaders like Delos Living, homeowners now have healthy home benchmarks and can set higher standards of living from the quality of their homes. Leaders in wellness real estate, Delos challenges the status quo by showing us what we should be expecting from our built environment. They've shown us how our homes can be a sanctuary of health, wellbeing, and environmental sustainability, in turn shaping sustainable cities for our future generations to lead healthy and productive lifestyles.  Image via DelosLiving.comHealthy homes are designed to enhance the health and wellbeing of the home's occupants. These healthy homes are great option for families as awareness grows about the dangers of building materials and other environmental factors in a home's design. Many builders and architects are beginning to specialize in this design style meaning the availability of homes like these are now more widespread. Green building is much more than a trend. It's a result of prioritizing human health and environmental responsibility. When entering the real estate market, one should consider the building's air, water, light, and energy and to take steps to be educated on the best options available. This will help prevent purchasing a home that exhibits traits of sick building syndrome.Commercial Real Estate Value Corporations are making the environmental responsibility shift much quicker than their residential counterparts when it comes to real estate. It seems that smaller projects use the theory that they have less room to justify the upfront costs and often question the potential of the ROI. Calculating ROI and communicating the benefits of green building is essential. This only further proves how necessary it is to have agents with green real estate designations who are able to explain the value and benefits of green homes and properties. It's only a matter of time before building legislation and growing expectations will affect ROI on personal or commercial real estate.Healthy classrooms and product disclosure is a hot topic in schools across the globe. It's no wonder when you consider how much time your child spends indoors. Choose a Real Estate Agent with Green Designation Municipalities and other levels of government are starting to make environmental policies and codes mandatory. To be competitive as a real estate professional, it's imperative to remain on the cutting edge of green building innovation, education, and designations. That's why continued training is now offered for career development which will also result in providing more value to real estate clients. Many real estate boards don't require their agents to pursue green designations. (Healthy home and neighborhood checklist). 4 green real estate designations available are: 1. EcoBroker Certified® Designations (US) 2. National Association of Green Agents and Brokers (non-profit): Offers the GreenRealestate™ program that leads to the Accredited Green Agent™ and Accredited Green Broker™ designations. 3. Earth Advantage (US): Sustainability Training for Accredited Real Estate Professionals (S.T.A.R.) Certification. 4. Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design: LEED Green Associate or LEED AP designations can be taken through LEED exams.Increase ROI on Your Home  Forward-thinking homeowners are greening their home for better re-sale value. Care for your largest investment - the health of your family, and maybe one of your largest real estate investments, your home. At least make inquiries about products and green renovate materials or at purchasing a green home. Many people are taking it to the next level by combining green energy into their design with the goal of achieving the ""net-zero"" status. There are many financial benefits to strategizing the energy efficiency of your home.  The Economics of Green.

By changing its operations with green solutions, they provide operational benefits to the businesses and have lasting positive impacts on both customers and brand awareness. Hotels such as the Best Western Chillworth Manor in the UK, the Farimont Hotels & Resorts, and The Rubens at the Palace hotel in London are all leaders in sustainability."

How can education reform facilitate this?Jiang Xueqin is an innovative thought leader in education reform in China who first shared his perspectives in The Global Search for Education East vs. West series in August of this year. Jiang is currently deputy principal of Tsinghua University High School, a highly regarded Chinese institution. His recently published book, Creative China, is about his experience developing curricula to teach Chinese students creativity and critical thinking skills. His writings have appeared in the Wall Street Journal and the Chronicle of Higher Education. He has been interviewed by media outlets including, The New York Times, NBC Nightly News, the BBC, and CNN. Today in The Global Search for Education, he speaks frankly about the education system in China. What is the current state of affairs of China's education system?In 2010, Chinese Premier Wen Jiaobao launched his education reform blueprint, calling for classrooms to emphasize critical thinking skills and creativity. Local school systems around the country launched creativity campaigns, passed laws limiting homework, and banned cram schools. However, a prisoner's dilemma mentality has taken hold and parents are so afraid of their child being left behind that the arms race of China's high-stakes testing system continues to escalate; while standing in line to enroll their four-year old in cram schools, parents complain to each other that high stakes testing is robbing their children of their childhood, curiosity, and creativity. What we have also is people discovering education as a new untapped market in China that promises to be just as lucrative as the real estate market. China's one percent are sending their children to elite overseas boarding schools and colleges. New private schools based on the Hotchkiss and Eton models are opening in Beijing and Shanghai to service the children of the Chinese elite. Young bright Western-educated Chinese are foregoing a career in finance to work at an education start-up. The education market, especially the study abroad market, is being flooded with VC money. All these trends tell us that market forces will allow for innovation and creativity in Chinese education. But these same market forces will only increase inequality and inequity in Chinese education. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to make sure the most disadvantaged have a fair shot at a better life.  ""It is imperative for the government to make sure the most disadvantaged have a fair shot at a better life."" -- Jiang Xueqin Is there a current plan of action to change China's inequality in education? Yes. Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a speech in September calling for China to emphasize creativity in the classrooms or risk being left behind economically. His first major emphasis is on building a more equitable education system. This makes sense because the gap between the have's and the have-not's has only widened, and for the sake of domestic stability, Xi Jinping has to attempt to address this gap through multiple channels. So he would like to see more education resources transferred from the rich coastal provinces to the hinterland, and see more students from the countryside enroll in elite urban universities. In general, this is a good sound policy that has wide support - but it's still unclear how it would be implemented, if it can be at all. What would be your steps towards reducing inequality in education? First, creating an early childhood program (for children as young as 8 months old) modeled on those found in Finland and Russia, where the poorest children are offered daycare to address gaps and deficiencies in nutrition, literacy, and emotional security that together determine failure or success in life. Second, investing heavily in vocational programs to offer students practical employable skills, while filling China's shortage of electricians, carpenters, and other skilled tradesmen. Third, building a national system of community colleges and continuous education programs to help employed workers upgrade their skill sets and work towards a university degree. ""If China is to recruit its best and brightest into the education sector, it needs to offer teachers the autonomy, the resources, and the respect in order to do their job right."" -- Jiang XueqinHow do you recruit the best and brightest students to be teachers and school administrators?  In his 2001 book, The Rise of the Creative Class, Richard Florida surveyed thousands of America's 30 million creative professionals and discovered that their job satisfaction was not based on salary, prestige, and location - but on the opportunity to work on challenging projects with high-achieving people from different backgrounds. If China is to recruit its best and brightest into the education sector, it needs to offer teachers the autonomy, the resources, and the respect in order to do their job right. And that means breaking up the monolithic socialist bureaucracy that is China's education system, and empowering local schools to experiment and develop a curriculum and system that's appropriate for their local needs and circumstances.Also, since Chinese love propaganda campaigns, why not launch a campaign to extol the heroic selfless patriotism of teachers, thereby reassuring teachers that reform will not result in any job loss? The campaign ought to emphasize that reform is about empowering teachers to have more of a say in their own classroom.What changes should be made to make curriculum more relevant?My preferred solution would be to have teachers and students engage in projects that have a direct impact in the lives of their classmates and of their community. Instead of offering students separate and distinct instruction in biology, chemistry, ecology, geography, nutrition, food security, and environmental protection, why not turn the school courtyard into an organic farm administered by the students with teachers as mentors? And then have the students prepare nutritious healthy meals for the school community using produce from this farm? In his book, The End of Education, the American cultural critic Neil Postman argued that students detach from school and ""amuse themselves to death"" because what they learn in school is neither relevant nor meaningful; to re-engage students, we need to let them have an impact in their community as well as a say over what they learn. I couldn't agree more with this sentiment.  ""My preferred solution would be to have teachers and students engage in projects that have a direct impact in the lives of their classmates and of their community.""  -- Jiang Xueqin  What do you think is the most pressing problem in Chinese education today?As an educator, what worries me most is the unprecedented level of adult involvement in the lives of children. Both in China and in America, parents - especially the well-educated, well-meaning, and wealthy ones - plan and supervise every minute of their child's life; meanwhile, schools give students more homework and try to cram more material into classroom instruction. These trends are unhealthy, and lead to mass parental neurosis and widespread student apathy. Sometimes, I think that teens like Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy because it's a perfect metaphor for how adults entertain themselves by making children compete against each other.Education leaders must respect the sacred space that is childhood, and the sacred bond between teachers and students. The chaotic, messy, and organic process that is childhood allows our brains to develop the neural wiring to be curious and creative risk-takers as adults. More than about knowledge delivery and retention, the classroom is where children can in a safe and secure setting discover a self-identity outside the home, develop the social skills to work and play with their peers, and negotiate a constructive relationship with authority. Teachers are caretakers first and foremost, and if education leaders leave teachers alone, they'll love and take care of the children under their care. But if education leaders impose performance standards, evaluation metrics, and testing goals, then teachers' utilitarian instincts take over, and schools can become toxic environments in which to work. In my experience as an administrator, I feel it is much more constructive and difficult to do less than to do more. It is emotionally taxing to trust students and teachers, and to let them just engage in the messy, chaotic, and organic process that is learning. It strokes the ego more to give speeches, hold curriculum meetings, and promulgate reform slogans. It seems that Chinese administrators are all for creativity, as long as they can control and dictate what students create - and it's okay for students to make mistakes as long as they are the right kinds of mistakes. It requires tremendous emotional intelligence, self-understanding, wisdom, maturity, and confidence to maintain a minimal interventionist attitude while offering non-judgmental support and encouragement. Teachers and students are the real stars of any great school, and real education leadership means playing a backstage and supporting role.For more information on Creative China  C. M.

13,WORLDPOST,Schools Can Be Front Line of Fight Against Ebola,"Gordon Brown, ContributorFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/safe-schools-ebola-gordon-brown_b_6286170.html,"While in some extreme cases schools have to be closed when they are at the center of an outbreak, investing in safe schools -- and the return of pupils to receive regular temperature checks and health education -- may be the best way to combat Ebola's further spread.",2014-12-08,"Kelvin Leadismo (2nd L), 12, and his classmates attend a tuition class at Loltulelei primary school on July 16, 2013 in Kisima township of Kenya's nothern county of Samburu. The class is attended by young shepherds from the Samburu community who are usually unable to attend regular daytime classes when they are tending to their family's livestock at pasture. The school runs a parallel tuition programme to the national curriculum that enables the otherwise illeterate shepherds acquire literacy through the two to three hour tuition courses presided over by volunteer teachers.

In short, as always, the most marginalized are the most at risk victims.But Ebola has had an even wider impact. And for many of the 5 million children shut out of school, lives are on hold. New pressures -- some are forced into child labor, some are pushed into child marriage -- are overwhelming them. Despair is taking over.It was once said you can survive for 40 days without food, 8 days without water, 8 minutes without air, but you cannot survive a minute without hope. The one way that young people can continue to hope for a better future is by continuing to go to school every day.The day-to-day lives of today's victims of widespread school closures in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are very different from a year ago. The students now have no place to learn, but that does not stop them mixing with each other, going outside and congregating in the streets. This is, of course, at odds with the public health rationale for closing schools. And while they could be receiving vital health information in their schools and undergoing temperature checks every day, they wander the streets instead, far outside the capacity of the already overburdened health systems to keep an eye on them.Outside their school, girls are under even more intense pressures with worrying reports pointing to increased rates of child pregnancy and teenage marriage, and with many boys and girls forced into domestic or other forms of underage labor to become breadwinners to make up for lost household incomes when parents are out of work.If this continues, it is not likely to be a short-term tragedy. We know from other emergencies -- from epidemics to armed conflicts -- that half the children who miss more than a year at school never see the inside of a classroom again.TIME FOR REOPENING OF SAFE SCHOOLSFortunately the business community, led by Nigeria's most successful business leader and philanthropist Aliko Dangote and Econet Wireless founder and charity pioneer Strive Masiyiwa, are alerting Africa to the urgent need to change course. Through the Global Business Coalition for Education they are calling for an early, responsible reopening of safe schools.Of course there are communities where schools still need to be temporarily closed to control the spread of Ebola -- and here we recommend using new distance learning technologies that Masiyiwa has been piloting to keep children inside the world of education.But, as this week's report shows, the vast bulk of schools should be seen as the first line of defense in preventing Ebola's spread and keeping children healthy. The safe school is one where there are teachers trained in basic public health. Schoolchildren are alerted to vital information about cleanliness, and about proper nutrition to keep their powers of resistance strong. With twice daily temperature checks, schools can be a monitoring and early warning system against the spread of disease. NIGERIA'S EXPERIENCEOnly a few months ago, Nigeria stopped the spread of Ebola. One key reason was that all state ministries of education ordered a minimum of two staff in each school to be properly trained by health workers about the Ebola virus.We see how important the school function is in our own societies. A few days ago, my two children in Great Britain were offered vaccines against the flu at their local school. In the United States alone, simple guidelines to prevent the spread of the flu posted in schools is estimated to stop 63 million cases each year.The U.N. agencies that are ready to move -- and that work hand in hand with governments -- are willing to establish clear guidelines for the reopening of safe schools and help prepare the necessary plans and safeguards. But until the world understands what we are losing by keeping schools closed, the shortage of funds frustrates the scale of response needed.Visits like those made by Ban Ki-moon and Jim Yong Kim next week can make a difference. In this festive Christmas season, the world cannot afford to relax. 2015 must be the year when we start to see that safe schools and not school closures are the better way out of the Ebola crisis."

It is a fight that Muslims must lead, that Muslims must win.",2014-12-08,"Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., left, accompanied by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., gestures during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington Thursday Oct. 13, 2011, to discuss the introduction of a Republican alternative jobs bill. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dff6240000510098f8f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rand Paul and John McCain are at odds over whether the Senate needs to declare war on ISIS. Paul insists that the Senate has no choice, as under the War Powers Clause of the US Constitution only Congress is empowered to take the country to war. McCain is derisive of Paul and his proposed war resolution, and has the support of his Senate colleagues, who have shown no interest in voting on the war. For some, this dispute may seem to be a technical matter--after all we have fought wars for decades without actually following the Constitutional rules. For others, Rand Paul among them, fealty to the Constitution demands that any decision to go to war be put to a vote. This may seem to many observers to be an intra-party skirmish that is of little import, but it is actually a rare opportunity for the country to consider whether and why we should go to war.We are not good at having national debates about important issues. When issues of importance come up, we run to our corners--Red vs. Blue. Fox vs. MSNBC--it is rare that we have substantive, thoughtful exchanges of ideas and views. On matters of war and peace, there are particular ironies. Despite having led the nation into two long wars that are now widely viewed as mistakes, the public continues to trust Republicans more than Democrats on matters of war and national security. Since the Vietnam War, Democrats have been viewed as the anti-war party, and for decades now they have struggled to change this image to little avail. The difference between the parties was most clearly on display in the vote to go to war in Iraq. Republicans wanted to vote yes, Democrats were afraid of voting no. Given this reality, the fight between Rand Paul and John McCain is the best chance we are likely to have for a real and substantive debate over US war policy.Rand Paul and John McCain start from very different positions. John McCain's moral authority as a hawk on matters of national security is rooted in his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He is a decorated veteran at a time when the percentage of Congress that has served in the military has declined to 20 percent from around 75 percent several decades ago. Rand Paul's credibility is largely rooted in his commitment to constitutional principles and his libertarian skepticism of governmental that is deeply rooted in the American ethos.If Vietnam is the source of McCain's moral high ground, it is also the source of his vulnerability in this debate. McCain has been an unmatched advocate of military intervention in recent years. At the same time, he fails to see that the Vietnam experience that took years of his life remains pivotal to American skepticism when our leaders sound the trumpets for a new war. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution that launched that decade-long war turned out to be predicated on a lie, and the communist regime that we feared is now our trading partner and ally. The Vietnam experience was followed by other wars and missteps that further demonstrated the unpredictable consequences of our war policies. In the 1980s, we partnered with Saudi Arabia to build an Islamist force to defeat the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, only to watch those Islamists morph into the Taliban, Al Qaeda and ultimately ISIS. In the 2000s, we went to war in Iraq on false pretenses to -- in the minds of the Neocons -- lay the foundation for a democratic transformation of the Arab world, only to wake up to the realization that we had delivered Iraq into Iran's sphere of influence. We have learned through painful experience that power on the battlefield is not enough to win a war. During the Vietnam War, Charles Colson, a senior aid to President Richard Nixon, had a plaque on his wall that said ""When you've got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."" That slogan summed up what was mistaken about our war policies. It turns out that it simply is not true. Hearts and minds do not follow, they generally go in the opposite direction. And people have long memories. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has proven to be a skillful manipulator of the American psyche. He has used public beheadings and threats to whip up our emotions to draw us into a ground war, and for good reason. Fighting America mano-a-mano would elevate ISIS's prestige as the front line of Islam's battle against the west. It would be a powerful recruiting tool and build support within Muslim community across the world that harbor resentments against America and the west. And Baghdadi's efforts have been successful. While a few months ago, the consensus across the political spectrum was that we would never send ground troops to this new war, now Speaker of the House John Boehner has suggested that it as inevitable, that we have ""no choice.""Rand Paul and John McCain should debate why, given our history in recent wars and our history in the region, going to war with ISIS is the best approach for achieving our goals. ISIS has many enemies in the region, and most of them have armies with far greater capability than ISIS. According to Wikipedia, Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia have between them over 1.25 million active duty military personnel, or just 150,000 fewer than the active personnel of the United States armed forces. Add to that the quarter million Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga force and the quarter million Syrian army and one can safely assert that the frontline states that are most immediately threatened by ISIS have the military capacity to deal with the threat that ISIS poses to the region.But each of these countries has other agendas, and as long as we are prepared to fight ISIS in their stead, they will not come together to address the threat that they each face. And certainly, each of them understands the threat that an American presence on the ground would creates a galvanizing force for ISIS. This is a fight for the hearts and minds of Sunni Islam, in the region and worldwide. It is a fight that Muslims must lead, that Muslims must win.If we expand our fight with ISIS, the outcome will not be what we expect. Despite all of our experience over the years, we still seem to ignore the fact that our presence on the ground changes things. Baghdadi understands this well. Every fighter killed by an American will win him three new recruits. Every photograph of a maimed Muslim mother holding a dead Muslim baby will amplify resentments toward America and increase the sympathy for and support of ISIS in Muslim communities across the world. How can he lose that fight?Rand Paul and John McCain must debate this war. This is not a Republican squabble, it is about whether we are going to go to war, what we hope to achieve and what we have learned from the past. We cannot let Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi force us into a war of his chosing. If we are to go, it must be our choice, with our eyes wide open, with our leaders explaining to us what we hope to achieve, and why we expect those results to be achievable. We should have this debate, and we should have it now."
15,GREEN,Climate Change and the Record 2014 California Drought,"Michael E. Mann, ContributorDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-and-the-re_b_6288402.html,I fear that the dubious claims by this latest report simply complicate prospects for having the very important and necessary conversation about what measures California will need to take to deal with what is likely to be a steadily worsening water crisis. That is no small matter.,2014-12-08,"TURLOCK, CA - FEBRUARY 25: A sign is posted near an almond farm on February 25, 2014 in Turlock, California. As the California drought continues and farmers struggle to water their crops, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation officials announced this past Friday that they will not be providing Central Valley farmers with any water from the federally run system of reservoirs and canals fed by mountain runoff. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb16218210000e700c732e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just a couple months ago, I critiqued a pair of studies that disputed any linkage between human-caused climate change and the exceptional 2014 California drought. Now comes yet another study (""Causes and Predictability of the 2011-14 California Drought"") with the imprimatur of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), announced with great fanfare (a NOAA press conference), drawing yet again the same conclusion. My criticisms of the latest study are yet again basically the same, but for reasons I explain below, that conclusion is even more implausible now than it was just two months ago.Let me start by noting that this latest report (unless I've missed something?) doesn't appear to be an actual peer-reviewed scientific article, but rather, an internal NOAA report. That causes me some concern, as the claims have not yet been submitted to the independent scrutiny of the larger scientific community in the manner it would have if it were published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.That having been said, my main concerns are far more fundamental. The methodology used in the current article, in my view, is deeply flawed because it doesn't properly account for a number of potentially important factors behind the record California drought. First of all, there is the role of Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). Despite what the authors claim, the Pacific SST patterns underlying the ongoing drought-favorable conditions may be partly forced, and not simply a result of natural climate variability. The IPCC ""CMIP5"" climate models which the authors quote in their defense may not be getting these patterns right because of flaws that persist even in many state-of-the-art climate models involving the physics underlying El Nino and decadal tropical Pacific climate variability. One recent study suggests that climate change does in fact favor an SST pattern in the North Pacific that increases the incidence of the atmospheric circulation pattern responsible for the current rainfall deficit. Secondly, the approach taken in this latest study doesn't account for the potential influence of decreasing Arctic Sea Ice. Studies going back more than a decade show that reduced Arctic sea ice may also favor the atmospheric circulation pattern underlying the current pattern of California drought. More recent work by Jennifer Francis of Rutgers provides independent support for that mechanism.Most inexplicable of all, though, is the fact that the authors pay only the slightest lip service to the role of surface temperature in drought, focusing almost entirely on precipitation alone. That neglects the fact that California experienced record heat over the past year, and this anomalous heat certainly contributed to the unprecedented nature of the current drought. Another article published just a week ago in one of the premier peer-reviewed journals in the field, Geophysical Research Letters (GRL), preemptively critiqued the present study, by stressing the importance of looking at the role of extremely high surface temperatures as well as precipitation in assessing the factors behind e.g. the 2014 California drought:And most ironic of all, just days ago, another article in GRL concluded that the record heat played a role in making the current California drought the worst such drought in at least 1200 years! (see also this discussion by Peter Gleick). The authors of the new report would really have us believe that is merely a coincidence and has nothing to do with the impact of human-caused climate change? Frankly, I don't find that even remotely plausible. I'm sure this latest study was done in good faith, and I don't question the intentions of the authors. But I'm troubled by the fact that the findings were announced with such fanfare (how many studies, let alone non peer-reviewed ones, get the benefit of a NOAA press conference?), when the conclusions are so flimsy, are contradicted by so much other peer-reviewed scientific work, and involve a matter of tremendous societal importance. I fear that the dubious claims by this latest report simply complicate prospects for having the very important and necessary conversation about what measures California will need to take to deal with what is likely to be a steadily worsening water crisis. That is no small matter.__________Michael Mann is Distinguished Professor of Meteorology at Pennsylvania State University and author of  The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines (now available in paperback with a new guest foreword by Bill Nye ""The Science Guy"")"
