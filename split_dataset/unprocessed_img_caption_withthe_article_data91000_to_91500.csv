In fact, it helped me become the successful entrepreneur I am today.",2015-04-23,2015-04-18-1429345701-3664779-Depositphotos_67371181_original_.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-18-1429345701-3664779-Depositphotos_67371181_original_-thumb.jpg,"Photo: Depositphotos While carrying my first son, I heard one of the most gut-wrenching statements a pregnant woman could hear from her doctor: ""1 percent chance!"" I had been diagnosed with a placental abruption and told that I had less than 1 percent chance of being released from the hospital with my baby in my belly. On day nine of my hospital stay, the doctor told me, ""Brigid, in order for you to be released from the hospital, you must go on bed rest for the duration of your pregnancy to keep your baby safe."" At 26 weeks into my pregnancy, my doc gave me strict orders: ""one shower a day, take the necessary trips to the bathroom, otherwise, don't move.""For the 10 weeks leading up to the birth of my son, I either sat in a big, oversized, comfy chair or laid on the sofa. On the outside, I felt like stabbing myself in the eye, I was so freaking bored. However, on the inside, my body was working overtime to bring my baby into the world. I knew I was doing the right thing by following the doctor's orders and taking it easy.In retrospect, bed rest turned out to be not all bad. In fact, it helped me become the successful entrepreneur I am today. Here are the five critical things I learned that have helped me grow my coaching business as a result of this medical emergency. 1. Unwavering Focus I had two jobs to do while I was on bed rest: (1) be still and (2) do everything in my power to keep my son safely snuggled in my belly until he was ready to meet the world.In running a business, you must have laser focus on who your target audience is and what your goals are in reaching this group of clients. If you try to appeal to everyone, you'll ultimately appeal to no one. Get focused on who you are targeting and how you are targeting.2. Organization My husband and I had to be extremely organized when it came to my bed rest. My husband was working full time, and had to prepare my breakfast, lunch, snacks and drinks I might need during the day and put them in a cooler next to me so I didn't get up throughout the day. If I was reading a book and I forgot it in the bedroom, then I asked him to grab it or I didn't get it till I went to the bathroom the next time. Being organized was crucial.In running your empire, you must be organized. It's essential to plan your content out, your social media posts, and your marketing and communication efforts with your clients and future clients. The more organized and prepared you are, the less likely you will forget something or have any unforeseen surprises. 3. Daily Plan of Action It may sound odd to have a daily plan of action while I sit on my behind for two months. Going from an energetic, full time employee to resting all day and being unable to work full time was a challenge. I had to create a daily plan of action so that I had something tangible to achieve. My plan included writing, working on my computer, knitting, reading and a little time for TV. Today a daily plan of action in my business is indispensable and is the same for any entrepreneur. By setting three goals to achieve each day, you can easily set yourself up for success. I don't recommend doing more than that, because it's vital to get the three things done and done well. It's also a great feeling to check them off the list at the end of the day. 4. Discipline I mentioned that I am super energetic. To be told to sit still and rest felt like I was just a bump on a log. It was a challenge for me, even knowing what I knew. However, I had to be disciplined. I thought, ""come on I just want to change the load of laundry, what could it hurt?"" But I stayed disciplined and followed through on what I needed to achieve. Yes there were times I wanted to cheat, but I always did the right thing. There was a big reward at the end and I knew my little guy's life was on the line.Being disciplined in business is vital when becoming an entrepreneur. When working for yourself you might want to put off something that doesn't come easy, but it needs to get done. The key is to stay disciplined, and do what must get done first. 5. Deal with Reality We were dealing with life and death when it came to our reality. While on bed rest we were allowed to attend one baby class. We spent the first hour listening to parents tell their fears, which were valid, but very different to our fears and our reality. They were worried about the sleepless nights, while we worried about our baby staying put for the duration of my pregnancy. It turned out we couldn't stay for the full class, because I started to have contractions and needed to return to my nest. It was a big reality check for us and we had to accept it.There is a reality check that when starting your own business. Will you have 1000 people on your list overnight? Most likely not. It will take loads of time and hard work to build your list but don't let that stop you. Stay connected to reality, and dream about where you want to go with your business and consider how you're going to get there. Have fun with building your business that's what is it all about.

His conceptualism achieves somethings apparently impossible which is to be experienced at an emotional level. The way, however, his work has been read till now, insists on transforming his pieces into a visual representation of some aspects of continental social philosophy. A year ago, a retrospective was dedicated to him at the Fundación PROA in my hometown, Buenos Aires where many of the works that will be shown in Venice were included. Three of them are of particular interest. The first one is a performance piece called ""Ebrea (Jewess)"" from 1971 where a nude young woman is included standing in front of a mirror. For the duration of the piece, the woman cuts off locks of her hair, pasting them in the shape of a Star of David onto the mirror. I don't think it is necessary for me to point out the link to the haircuts given to Auschwitz prisoners on the way to the gas chambers, with simulated hideous objects, such as soap made from corpses and a horse harness fabricated from human skin. Ironically, Nicola Costantino, the artist chosen by the Argentinians to represent them at the Biennale 2013 gained notoriety after producing soap made of human fat sourced from cosmetic surgery. Although the links to Nazi practices were also obvious there, the fact that last year she presented in Venice an installation dedicated to no other than Eva Perón, wife of the Argentine dictator who allegedly financed his presidential campaign allowing Nazis to find exile in Argentina, comes across as ironic. There is a difference, however, between Mauri's and Costantino's performance. While the former aims at creating a psychological environment where horror becomes seductive and, thus, a source of shame, the latter goes a bit too far by glamorizing that horror. Another of the pieces presented in Venice will be ""Evil Numbers"", a nonsensical mathematical formula written on a blackboard facing a large photomural of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, at the ""degenerate art"" exhibition at the Haus der Kunst in Munich in 1937. Describing these works by Mauri, Enwezor, who is also the current director of the Haus der Kunst is absolutely right when saying: ""They are not like visual events but more like psychological events'.When I was a child, a man followed me on my way to a school football practice and while on the bus, he approached me, grabbed my hand and rubbed it against his crotch. Even though I ran to the lavatories to wash my hands upon arrival to school, I found myself fantasizing with that moment many times ever since and, in a way, has defined my relationship with gay sex. Similarly, a friend of mine who was raped, told me once that he sometimes goes through the same kind of shamefully erotic feelings. It is like an inverted Stockholm Syndrome that focuses on the feeling instead of the perpetrator. I think that it is precisely that psychological cornice that Mauri's performances invite us to walk. The viewer is immediately forced to participate in actions that are both seductive and shameful maybe that is why Mauri used to say that during his childhood 'even the sun was fascist'. The decision of the curator of the Venice Biennale to focus on this psychological exploration comes at a time when all the readings of his work have seemed to focus on the way he explored the impossibility of representation after the Holocaust. This is, of course, true but it does not exhaust the possibilities that his works (as art) brings about. An example of this is the informed way in which the Italian curator of the Buenos Aires show, Ivan Barlafante referred to his series of 48 screens hung on a wall in a minimalist fashion, as the result of reducing representation to its minimum transforming them into a mere objects. In Barlafante's attempt to canonize Mauri as a post-war humanist who discussed representation itself as a possibility after the Holocaust, he ends up forgetting about the viewer's experience and, most of all, of his feelings. It is in the paradoxical vicious circle of erotic attraction and humanistic shame that Mauri's response to American Pop Art should be inscribed. His discussion of the role of the media in today's society is not concerned with representation as such (as technical reproduction or serialization) but with the seduction that self harm has in all of us once modernity's optimism is over.

4,ARTS,Life's a Rush,"Helen Eisenbach, ContributorWriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lifes-a-rush_b_7105294.html,"In the throes of fighting for her life, Margolin revels in vivid memories of her youth, unscheduled raptures far from the enforced multitasking of today. And where she now finds herself is where she would have hoped to be.",2015-04-23,2015-04-21-1429654378-1663854-DebMargolinin8STOPSPhoto1HighResCreditisAlexanderIziliaev.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-21-1429654378-1663854-DebMargolinin8STOPSPhoto1HighResCreditisAlexanderIziliaev-thumb.jpg," I've noticed it's hard for me to get to the point. That's because I don't see one. There is no bitterness whatsoever in that statement.Playwright-actor Deb Margolin's new solo performance piece, 8 Stops, mines the unique experiences of one woman fighting to stay alive. In the process she delivers a darkly comic, deeply affecting exploration of the meaning of life. I learned a few things in conversation with the OBIE winner, teacher and cancer ""parolee"":1. She wasn't afraid of dying.I'm a person who rehearses their surprises; I like to figure out these ontological fire drills. Okay, if things get really nasty, what am I gonna do? It was not depressive thinking; it was planning.2. Her life is her art, and vice versa.After years searching for a way to talk about the surreal process of undergoing a stem-cell transplant to vanquish Hodgkin's lymphoma, Margolin was working on another piece at ""powerhouse"" Dael Orlandersmith's writers' residency when 8 Stops sprang into being. ""I've used theater consistently as a way of working through intense personal experience, and creating, [out] of a group of very kind but random people, a sort of citizenship of generous witnesses,"" says Margolin. Orlandersmith ""told everybody to invade their own privacy,"" and to Margolin's surprise: ""I ended up making the connection between my son's fear of what death was, and my actual experience during the stem-cell transplant -- the endless corridor of darkness and nothingness."" Though her son's traumatic fantasy of death mirrored what she went through, ""fear is for the living,"" Margolin reckons. ""Death's probably not that bad.""We live in Montvale and not a single person there cares if we live or die, but we awake each day to window frames that look like the frames of paintings, the trees posing tall and thin as live fashion models for the designer of each season, who dresses them now in green, now in pastel, now in cherry blossom, now in mountain laurel, now in the cold whites of winter.3. She swore she'd never live in New Jersey. She now lives in denial.I'm the kind of person that anything I make fun of, it happens to me. Whatever I send up, I become. When I was a young performance artist going from club to club, they'd say, 'How do you want to be introduced?' Among its tales 8 Stops shares the perverse beauty of life in the least-glamorous house in a moneyed enclave.4. She investigates things most people don't dare look in the eye -- illness, George W. Bush, death. And parenthood.I've never felt so stared at, so looked at, so observed as I have by my children, particularly when they were very small and everything I did was noticed, in terms of a clue as to how life gets lived, and the correct way to deal with other people, with adversity, with a wind that pulls up your skirt... You're on all the time when you have a kid.It was the ""ferocity of the love you feel as a parent"" that surprised her most: ""By the time I had a kid, I'd loved people in lots of ways. I didn't think I could be taught a different kind of love on that level. It was stunning."" Also rich fodder for comedy: ""It exposes your flaws instantly and profoundly.""I brought this baby home...I was 38 years old and I didn't really have any friends who were babies... 5. She never imagined she'd be a mother.""At 38, 40, almost 41 -- that's as fast as I could do that. Life is rushed. I mean, life goes by very fast. You're supposed to get an awful lot done in a very short period of time."" Sixteen years teaching at Yale provides another form of parenting: ""The kids are smarter than I am, but I'm older than they are.""  6. Empathy runs in the family.Margolin has a flair for merging polar opposites, like the blessing and curse of ""the grief of endless compassion,"" a phrase that recurs in the show. ""I wouldn't trade it,"" says Margolin. ""I don't think my son would trade it... He senses the discomfort of other people and seeks to ease it. His life is made a lot more complicated by it, but I think on the main it's a gift.""My father worships God without the slightest respect for the concept of God, and I feel the same... Atheists who pray all the time.7. She likes a challenge.The most satisfying part of creating 8 Stops? Finally having found language, after trying to get language to meet me under a streetlight for a cigarette for so long, to describe this experience... The putting together of grief and joy, in equal measure...The challenges are the rewards, it turns out: ""They reside in the same place.""In love with life, on the phone all night, running barefoot in the moonlight to a friend's house, listening to the Beatles' White Album, no appointments, just raw impulse.8. She's grateful for everything that's happened to her.In the throes of fighting for her life, Margolin revels in vivid memories of her youth, unscheduled raptures far from the enforced multitasking of today. And where she now finds herself is where she would have hoped to be -- ""Not exactly in this form,"" she says, ""but I am in most ways living the life I dreamed of living."" The show she re-creates nightly with wit, warmth and whirlwind precision is many things: ""It's a prayer, it's a shriek of affirmation, it's a cry of joy and gratitude,"" says its creator. As for her dream for how audiences will see it: ""My greatest hope is that while we're talkin' death, we make people laugh their asses off,"" says Deb Margolin, exiting the stage.DEB MARGOLIN IN 8 STEPS: PHOTOGRAPH BY ALEXANDER IZILIAEV."

If you find words that bother you, please substitute different words in their place and don't let semantics stop you from hearing the story.When I went with my husband to a sex and relationship coach for the first time, I was really nervous. My desire had been much less than my husband's for well over a decade and I didn't even know how to begin the conversation. So I was pretty happy when our coach said we were simply going to start with breathing. That I can do, I told myself. She asked me to take a deep breath and then asked me where I felt it. ""Um, in my lungs?"" I half said, half asked.She nodded and asked me to take another breath, this time a little deeper, and again asked me where I felt it. Drawing from my yoga class or two, I smugly said ""Oh, I am pretty sure I felt that in my belly too."" She grinned and asked me to take one final breath, this time really deep. I did, and again she asked me where I felt it. This time I was a little confused and gave her a quizzical look. And she asked me, ""Did you feel it all the way down to your pussy?""Okay people. Let's be serious. NO. I did not feel it all the way down to there. Was I supposed to feel it all the way down to there?!? Do people feel it all the way down to there?!?What happened next took a huge weight off my shoulders that I previously never realized was there. She used her hand to divide the upper half of her body from the lower half, just like I'm doing in the photo above, and said ""No problem. You've just lost the connection between up here and down there. We can work on reconnecting it.""She went on to describe how as children we're presented with so many messages from society to ""keep it in our pants"" and then when we are all grown up and facing the normal stresses of daily life, it's no wonder we have a hard time staying in tune with our body. This resonated within me so deeply that I instantly knew it to be fundamental to my issues with desire.I left that session with some ""homework."" For the next couple weeks, whenever I encountered something that made me pause and smile (a sunny day, a pretty flower), I was supposed to stop and breathe ""down to there."" Additionally, whenever I was putting on clothing, I was supposed to go slowly and really concentrate on the feeling of the various fabrics on my skin. And to my genuine surprise and delight, over the course of those two weeks, I was suddenly thinking about and desiring sex on a regular basis for the first time since the early days of our relationship. And I thought, maybe, just maybe, there was something great on the horizon.""Wait, that's it?"" Transformation takes time, so I'm intentionally sharing in bite-sized doses that reflect my experience over the last year. I'd love to hear your questions, let's continue the conversation in the comments section below. Or visit my blog at www.downtothere.com"

I and millions of fellow optimists are hopeful as well, as we look for another leader who can make a difference that makes a real impact, especially in the experiences of our underrepresented and underserved young people and their educational outcomes. As each election goes by, I feel like Charlie Brown and his on-the-field encounters with Lucy and ""the football."" Just as my man Chuck makes his approach to the ball, Lucy pulls it away and he falls flat on his back. Anguish follows, but then hope springs eternal, and Charlie Brown tries again. Is that where we are now, optimistically taking focus on that pigskin yet fearing another whiff? I believe many Americans are a bit ambivalent by nature. When confronting a serious social issue, we hold two ideas in our head simultaneously. We ask, ""Why can't our government do something?"" And then, without missing a beat, we lament that our government will likely screw up. My sense is that we look at our political leaders in much the same way. President Obama, during his one-and-a-half terms as Commander-in-Chief, has been bold about social initiatives that help support people and communities of color and the middle class. However, the President and Congress may have whiffed on delivering policies that really improve opportunities for systemic school change and innovation. Unfortunately, the Race to the Top has left too many students near the bottom.We continue to hear a lot lately about inequality. Of course, we do not mean basic inequality. There's very little we can do about that. We are born with obvious differences that bring us a lifetime of benefits and challenges. The fact that I am six foot eight makes it easier for me to have my way on the basketball court and more challenging to fit into an airplane seat. We all learn to live with and capitalize on such inequalities. What is deeply troubling and much harder to live with is inequality of opportunity and access, particularly for our young people. Our leaders must be sure those opportunities exist and are accessible to ALL. And then, as educators, we must prepare our students to understand and grasp those opportunities, particularly those that require deep and sustained learning in the real world. Some have observed that opportunity is declining in this country. There are certainly some signs that point in that direction. Take a look at the Bureau of Labor's list of fastest declining occupations. A cursory glance suggests that manufacturing and other labor-intensive trades are quickly going the way of the dodo, which is going to leave behind an entire segment of our population for whom an academic-based education hasn't been a top priority. The middle class is shrinking, good-paying jobs are scarcer, and providing for a family is ever more challenging. Expanding the number of real opportunities is something we expect our leaders to do something about without screwing it up.It wasn't too long ago that many of us thought it impossible that we'd see an African-American President in our lifetime. But that has happened. As we move toward 2016, we already have a woman and two Latino candidates. Has their -- will their -- sensitivity to inequality of opportunity produce much change in the prospects for our young people? And what about us? Their educators? Will the learning opportunities we provide our students -- as deep and varied as they are -- provide them with opportunity in that larger sense? Will our leaders hold that football steady for us so that we can give it a satisfying boot? Like Charlie Brown, I remain eternally hopeful... for our children."

They take on more responsibility and claim no credit for all their work. They are caring, compassionate and willing to sacrifice their needs for others. Aren't these qualities that we would look for in a President?",2015-04-23,"Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton attends the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Advancing Women in Peace and Security at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, April 22, 2015. AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb60346200000c10100f624.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A few days ago, Cheryl Rios, a business woman from Texas, stated that women aren't qualified to become President because of ""hormones and biblical reasons."" She further stated that she'd move to Canada if Hillary Clinton is elected President. It does not matter that decades ago, Britain had Margaret Thatcher, India had Indira Gandhi and Israel had Golda Meir. It seems that, according to Cheryl Rios, American women have more hormone problems than British, Indian or Israeli women.We do not live in utopia. There always will be some people who are biased against other people and judge them by their race, sexual orientation and gender. It's a bit shocking that in 2015, that there are people who think a woman should only be a housewife. Worse yet, this judgement comes from another woman, who is the CEO of a marketing company. I wrongly assumed women would advocate for their female peers over their male counterparts. I am an engineer and I did not take biology in college, so I am ignorant about hormones and their effect on women or men. Like Cheryl Rios, I can only voice my personal opinion based only on my personal experience.Despite the many problems such as disparity in pay, the gender gap in engineering and technology and the women's right to choose, I believe America is overall a better place for women than most other countries in the world. This is one of the primary reasons I stayed in America after my Ph.D. -- I wanted my three girls to grow up in a place where they will have lot more opportunities to purse their dreams than my mother and sisters had.Everyone has a story behind their opinion. I don't know Cheryl Rios' story, but my story is simple. I was born in a large family. I was the 7th child in the family of eight girls and three boys. My mother a saint; I have never seen anyone with so much patience and love. She is a great story teller. She did not complete high school, though her brothers completed college; this was simply because she was a woman. That was a long time ago. The most important thing about my childhood is that I was surrounded by women and was pretty much raised by my older sisters in my early years. They did everything for me; giving me showers, dressing me up, getting me ready to go to school, helping with homework and telling me bedtime stories. Even as a child, I knew that my sisters were smarter than me. They worked lot harder than me. They woke up early and did lot of household work. They did laundry, cleaned the house and helped my mom with cooking. They did it all, all while going to school and receiving outstanding grades. Being smart and hardworking is not enough in many societies if you are a woman. None of my older sisters went to or completed college because they had to be married at an early age, or had to take care of household work. I, who never lifted a finger to help anyone at home, was able to go to college just because I was a boy. One of my sisters is such a leader and an organizer, she would be an outstanding CEO of a Fortune 500 company, if only she had the opportunity. Another sister of could have been a world class dancer. Another could have been a world class chef. Another could have become a great teacher. None of this happened, simply because they were born women in a society where their primary responsibility and role in life were to become a wife and mother.My wife has a masters degree in engineering and yet, people would talk to me about engineering and ignore her because she is a woman. I have never seen anyone multitasking like my wife. When she does things it is almost like a symphony. She could be on the phone with her mom while crushing garlic for dinner, helping our children with homework and making tea for me. She does all this while running a business. I could never do that. My wife is infinitely wiser, hardworking and knowledgeable than me.I have three daughters, but I have learned more from my daughters than anybody else in all my years in academia. They are still young, but their maturity level at their young age now is something I could not come even close when was at their age. Their posture, their willingness to work hard, the way they carry themselves and care for others is something I can only hope for. I do not know if they have aspirations to run a company, or run for an office. But I certainly do not want someone else, especially another women telling them that they can't do something because of 'hormones.'In my experience, all the women in my life are smarter and more hardworking than men. They take on more responsibility and claim no credit for all their work. They are caring, compassionate and willing to sacrifice their needs for others. Aren't these qualities that we would look for in a president?It is a shame that some people hold such low opinion about women. Ultimately opinions like this won't matter. Americans have elected the first African-American President. I do not know if Hillary will be the next President, but I do know that it won't be long before a women is called POTUS."

How much do you value the environment around you? How often to do you take a break to step outside? When was the last time you spent time exploring the outdoors?My past three months abroad of discovering new places and wonders of this world has given me a much greater appreciation for Mother Nature, and I am constantly trying to keep my head up to realize just how beautiful our surroundings are. Something as simple as a walk through the woods or a stroll around your local park can open your eyes up to something new. I feel a great sense of peace and serenity when I allow myself to be completely immersed in the nature around me - when I take the time to intentionally step away from the distractions of my newsfeed, put down my phone, and just step outside for even a few minutes each day.Today, I encourage all of you to take some time to look around at the world you live in and realize just how remarkable it is. Spend some time outside and learn how to become comfortable when it's just you and God's work. Leave all your gadgets behind and give yourself time to breath and reflect. Take it all in - breathe in the freshly cut grass, marvel at the fact that spring is a new beginning bringing to life to plants and flowers that were buried for months. Give yourself the same opportunity for new beginnings.And while you're taking the time to step outside and disconnect, do a little good for this Earth. As I'm writing this post, I just donated a two full day's worth of drinking water to a child in need. TWO WHOLE days in the matter of minutes.How? It's easy - I put down my phone.For every 15 minutes that you don't use your smartphone, the sponsors and donors of the UNICEF Tap Project will fund one full day of clean drinking water for a child in need. All you have to do is go to uniceftapproject.org on your cell phone and commit to not using your phone for at least 15 minutes. The longer you disconnect, the greater amount of clean water can be provided.Celebrate Earth Day and help those in need all at the same time - and don't let it stop today.This article was originally published on Quarter for Your Crisis, a community for Millennials to reconnect with themselves, their faith, and the world around them."

""The Pledge in Solidarity to Defend Marriage,"" which Staver co-authored with Deacon Keith Fournier of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond, Virginia, defines marriage as ""ontologically between one man and one woman"" and ""not based on religion or revelation alone, but on the Natural Law, written on the human heart and discernible through the exercise of reason."" Although specifics of how the pledge will be enacted are scarce, the authors nonetheless ask supporters ""to stand together to defend marriage for what it is, a bond between one man and one woman, intended for life, and open to the gift of children.""Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is reportedly gearing up for a 2016 presidential campaign, is among the high-profile conservative names to back the pledge, which had drawn over 5,300 signatures at the time this story was first written. Also acknowledged for their support are former Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum, American Family Association President Tim Wildmon and Mission: America's Linda Harvey, all of whom have been vocal in their opposition to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights for some time. ""A decision purporting to redefine marriage flies in the face of the Constitution and is contrary to the natural created order,"" Staver and Fournier write. ""As people of faith we pledge obedience to our Creator when the State directly conflicts with higher law. We respectfully warn the Supreme Court not to cross this line."" Staver, of course, has made no secret of his stance on LGBT issues, including marriage equality. Earlier this month, he argued that the U.S. government had spent ""more than $225 billion"" on homosexuality over the course of 26 years, resulting in ""the breakdown of the family culture"" and other ""social consequences,"" in a radio bulletin. In 2013, he also argued that the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Prop 8 were not reflective of ""natural law, biblical law or common sense; it is contrary to the natural created order of God almighty.""Founded in 1989, the Liberty Counsel is a nonprofit Christian policy organization whose aim is to ""preserve religious liberty and help create and maintain a society in which everyone will have the opportunity to discover the truth that will give true freedom,"" according to its website.At the time this story was first published, a representative for Staver had yet to respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.

Or is it a form of enabling? Will such institutionalized waffling become a metaphor for the dangers of equivocation and set the style not only for culinary taste, but for life choices in general? Sure it's easier not to make a choice. Let's say I go to a diner and am tempted by the turkey meatloaf special but also have a hankering for the fried chicken basket? Do I order the turkey meatloaf fried chicken basket? Do I go for matzo ball pea when I can't choose between matzo ball and pea soup. On a macro scale you see this in the profusion of Chinese and Japanese restaurants whose so-called fusion cuisine is really an attempt to play both ends against the middle, resulting in a cuisine that is neither fish nor fowl. Fressers who grow up slurping mixed wanton egg drop and eating in Chinese Japanese restaurants are likely to turn into lawyer/ accountants, architect/ builders, editor/ writers or coach/athletes. While there are virtues to playing both sides of the fence in work as well as love (ie being AC/DC), the danger is always of a watering down the original intention. Whether it be in soup or lovemaking there's a point where you don't taste anything any more. In one sense mixed wanton egg drop is a product of our modern internet culture in which the amount of choices available through Google and other search engines makes it impossible to make decisions.

Infertility, a disease of the reproductive system, impacts 1 in 8 couples of reproductive age and can be very isolating to face. Just hearing ""you are not alone"" can help in so many ways. Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking with Tomiko Fraser Hines, the first African American face of Maybelline, self-proclaimed ""infertility overcomer,"" and RESOLVE ambassador. Seven years ago, Hines was diagnosed with infertility due to premature ovarian failure, an autoimmune disorder. She and her husband began an emotionally draining infertility journey and spent thousands of dollars, pulling from their retirement savings, on a number of different infertility treatments. After six years of trying to conceive, Hines and her husband chose to use an anonymous egg donor, and Hines gave birth to twin boys. I reached out to Tomiko about her experience with first deciding to share her infertility story, and specifically asked how the disease impacts the African American community. Barbara: You decided to go public about your infertility -- why did you decide to tell your story? Who did you tell?Tomiko: We didn't decide, we chose to share our story -- which I feel is a more powerful stance than simply deciding to go public. In the beginning of our infertility struggle, my husband and I felt very alone and couldn't get any answers about the disease. African Americans were not talking about it online, including celebrities. After becoming pregnant through an anonymous egg donor, my girlfriend suggested that I might consider sharing our story to inspire and encourage others, as well as put an African American face to the disease and erase the shame and guilt associated with infertility. Barbara: How did you share your story? Tomiko: I remember the post very clearly. I posted our story on Facebook when I was about six months pregnant. I titled the post ""Unstoppable,"" because my husband and I had to remind ourselves that we were in fact, unstoppable. After the post went live and I received such a positive response, I wrote an article for Mommy Noire, an African American women's blog about all things mommyhood. I was also interviewed by Essence magazine and Katie Couric. Barbara: Do you think that the African American community shares their infertility stories differently than others? Tomiko: It's my belief that there is still a taboo of shame and guilt surrounding infertility in the African American community. There is a stigma that we shouldn't air our dirty laundry, and we have to be strong. Conversations around infertility are tentative or may not happen at all. But all communities can relate to the same feelings and struggles with this disease. Barbara: What kind of response did you receive when you shared your story?Tomiko: The response was overwhelmingly, 100 percent positive. There were no negative comments, whether in person or online. I received comments, especially from women of color, who seemed to be breathing a sigh of relief after seeing the videos and articles I posted online, because someone was talking about the issue from an empowered standpoint. I've formed amazing connections with individuals experiencing infertility, and I continue to stay updated with them throughout their journeys. An amazing micro-community formed because my husband and I chose to share story. Barbara: Why did you decide to partner with RESOLVE?Tomiko: RESOLVE has been a part of my journey even before I reached out to ask to partner with the organization. RESOLVE solidified the empowered choice my husband and I made to go forward with an anonymous egg donor. I reached out to RESOLVE, and we decided to work together so that I could share my story and specifically raise infertility awareness for the African American community. Barbara: You were the emcee at the 2014 California Walk of Hope event, our signature fundraising event that supports those with infertility. Can you tell us about your experience? Tomiko: I felt like a teenager going to prom -- I was giddy with excitement and incredibly honored. Everyone at the Walk of Hope ""gets"" the infertility journey. There was an overwhelming feeling of possibility, hope, and support at the Walk of Hope -- not a feeling of doom and gloom. It reinforced the fact that infertility is coming out of the shadows.If you want to learn more about Tomiko's story, you can participate in a Twitter Chat with her on Thursday, April 23rd at 3 PM EST.

The group -- which included Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse -- boasted the brightest artistic lights of its age. Stein, while a forceful personality and notable writer, battled critical and popular confusion in response to her experimental style. She eschewed most punctuation and capitalization, instead amassing overwhelming, repetitive waves of unbroken words. Her most well-known quote, ""A rose is a rose is a rose,"" is perhaps the most succinct way to capture this style. Her deliberately obscure writing confounded and irritated many critics, and apparently at least one publisher. On April 19, 1912, she was sent a rejection letter for her latest manuscript parodying her impenetrable prose. Ouch. Below, we've excerpted the letter from Bad Days in History: A Gleefully Grim Chronicle of Misfortune, Mayhem, and Misery for Every Day of the Year by Michael Farquhar, published April 21, 2015 (National Geographic):APRIL 19, 1912 A Snub Is a Snub Is a Snub The acclaimed but often impenetrable author Gertrude Stein received the following rejection letter -- cruelly mocking her eclectic writing style -- from London publisher Arthur C.

Almost every state in America is introducing higher, more rigorous standards for all students. New assessments that strive to assess students' critical thinking and problem solving abilities alongside their basic comprehension are being developed. These new standards and assessments are helping forge a new vision for teaching and learning so all students graduate college and career ready -- no matter their zip code. How can we make sure this vision becomes reality? Simply put, we need to support and empower educators to become continuous learners who are curious, persistent and reflective -- the core capabilities and dispositions these new standards require. No Child Left Behind did some great things -- namely, shining a spotlight with data on the inequities in our educational system that harm our most marginalized groups of students. However, when these data were laid at our feet and accompanied by high-stakes assessments, our collective reaction did little to create opportunities for all students to be college and career ready.The higher the stakes, the worse our response. Our actions disproportionately impacted the highest needs students in unintended ways that did not improve their educational outcomes. In the name of closing the achievement gap, we doubled down on foundational reading and math instruction. We scripted our curriculum. We removed or severely reduced all subjects -- like science, art and music -- that serve as excellent vehicles for teaching core skills like literacy and numeracy. We bubble-tested our students in the name of ""test-prep."" The poorer the school district, the greater the negative impact.We taught to a test and not to a student. Affluent schools and districts were able to keep up their programs, supplementing at school with fundraising or after school activities, and rest on their successes on a narrow, standardized test. Fifteen years later the data tell us the same story. Children in America are not achieving at the same level as their international peers. African-American and Latino children are not achieving at the same level as their White and Asian peers. Children with learning differences are not progressing far enough or fast enough.Teachers who have become accustomed to scripted lessons, standardized worksheets and bubble-laden assessments must now decide, on their own and through collaborating with other educators, how to best help students reach the standards. This change will be hard. But there is good news. This is the change teachers want. This is the change that empowers our teachers to apply their largely untapped talents. This is the change that elevates the role of the teacher from script-reader to facilitator of learning. Most importantly, this is the change our students deserve.This change will be hard and the scale is massive -- there are 3.4M teachers in K-12 public schools in America. Add to this number, the millions of principals, parents, teacher educators, and students who have become accustomed to the reductionist approach to teaching and learning that has been dominant for nearly two decades. The good news is teachers have a passion for improving student outcomes and are willing to do whatever it takes to grow as professionals. A report released this week at the Education Writers Association National Seminar by The VIVA Project ​and Education Post confirms what we've heard from teachers: they are excited about the possibilities and hopeful they will receive the training and support they need to make sure their students are successful. This will require a combination of autonomy and intentionality. A classroom example should help illustrate this point.Let's think about Maria, a 4th grade teacher with a classroom of 26 bright-eyed students. Several struggle with decoding and others with reading Harry Potter. Some have deep-seated math phobias and others are getting ready for algebra. Some have multiple supports at home and others don't. All learn differently, and all need to reach these newer, higher standards. First and foremost, Maria creates a positive and nurturing learning environment where all students feel safe to learn and contribute to the classroom community. She knows every student well and uses that knowledge to meet students where they are and get them to where they need to be. With a deep toolbox of strategies and resources across all disciplines, she teaches in a way that makes sure all students are succeeding. And most importantly, she develops the core capabilities and dispositions that help her know which strategy or resource to use with which students, and when. A trusted source carefully selects those strategies and resources, and Maria has the autonomy to determine their use. How, exactly, can we couple autonomy with intentionality -- at scale -- in a way that helps students and teachers succeed with new state standards? This is an important question, and one that is driving my colleagues and me to explore new solutions and ways of working.The challenge ahead is to build a profession of teachers who are trusted; who are constantly learning; who know they can take risks to reach every student; who persevere in solving complex issues; who are open to feedback that helps them grow professionally; and, ultimately, who believe all students can learn and meet higher standards. College and career readiness for ALL students is not an option. But for this vision to become reality, we need to learn from our past and then move forward in a different way. Let's do what it takes to make sure teachers can teach to the student, not the test."
17,EDUCATION,Putting Our Children First: Teacher Marylin Zuniga Should Be Back in Her Classroom,"Donna Nevel, ContributorCommunity psychologist and educator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/putting-our-children-firs_b_7108800.html,"This past week, I attended an Orange Township public school board meeting in New Jersey in support of first-year teacher, Marylin Zuniga, who has been suspended from her teaching position at Forest Street Elementary School.",2015-04-22,2015-04-21-1429630289-2756018-MarylinZunigawithstudentsNewarksBooksandBreakfastProgram.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-21-1429630289-2756018-MarylinZunigawithstudentsNewarksBooksandBreakfastProgram-thumb.jpg,"Marylin Zuniga and students, Newark's Books and Breakfast ProgramThis past week, I attended an Orange Township public school board meeting in New Jersey in support of first-year teacher, Marylin Zuniga, who has been suspended from her teaching position at Forest Street Elementary School. Hundreds of Ms. Zuniga's supporters were in the room. Her offense? She allowed her third grade students to send get-well cards to political prisoner Mumi Abu-Jamal. Community members, parents, teachers, and professors spoke on Ms. Zuniga's behalf. They cited her talent and compassion as an educator, as well as the injustice of her suspension. Supporter after supporter addressed the members of the school board with passion and conviction, clearly committed to Marylin Zuniga as a teacher and deeply concerned about the education of the children in their community. Until that moment, Ms. Zuniga, who entered the profession with a stellar academic record, had been identified as a ""model teacher"" based on all formal observations of her teaching. No one has denied that her students were flourishing, that she was respected and valued by parents, and that she was a devoted, creative, and highly-qualified teacher. Members of the school board were visibly shaken by the outpouring of support for Ms. Zuniga. The superintendent had already suspended her, and word had been that the board was intending to terminate her. As the meeting went on and as the demand for her immediate reinstatement became louder and more insistent, the school board president announced that public comment would end at 9:30, less than an hour after the hearing began. When the audience reminded the president of the long line of speakers still waiting to be heard, she responded that, ""they're all saying the same thing."" Finally, after hearing from Ms. Zuniga, the board announced it would reconvene in early May. The meeting ended with supporters chanting, ""Let her teach.""Judging from the perspective of what was best for her students--which, of course, should have been school officials' only concern-- suspending Ms. Zuniga absolutely made no sense. Had her principal or mentors been concerned about the letters to Mumia Abu-Jamal or what a lesson about him should include--and good educators can of course have different views -- they could have sat together and discussed the pedagogic approach and curriculum moving forward. The suspension of Ms. Zuniga followed close on the heels of a public statement by the former president of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) attacking her for supporting a ""cop killer."" It need hardly be said that he was not speaking as an educator, but, rather, was pursuing his and the FOP's own anti-Mumia agenda. But for the FOP's intrusion into all this, it is impossible to imagine that suspension would have ever been remotely on the table. Ms. Zuniga taught about Mumia Abu-Jamal during Black History Month as part of a series of uncelebrated civil rights leaders. As she stated in a public statement at the school board meeting, In February, my students participated in a civil rights series highlighting multiple leaders. On February 5th I presented a do-now that stated: '""What is the main idea of this quote?: 'So long as one just person is silenced, there is no justice.' This quote is by Mumia Abu-Jamal. Many of my students took it upon themselves to go home and do research about civil rights leaders discussed in class. In April, I mentioned to my students that Mumia was very ill and they told me they would like to write 'get well' letters to Mumia.Teachers, often with supervisors, review and reflect upon lesson plans all the time. This lesson offered an opportunity for a fuller discussion of teaching about controversial figures in the classroom--which would involve a discussion of who gets to determine who is ""controversial"" and what that even means. For example, in the case of journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal, a critically important fact is that the trial against him has been widely viewed as a travesty of justice, including by Amnesty International and other human rights organizations and leaders across the globe. Scholars and educators across the US understand the importance of social justice education in our classrooms. Many of them, including Pedro Noguera, Marc Lamont Hill, Michelle Fine, Noam Chomsky, Ofelia Garcia, signed a letter to the Mayor and school board insisting that Ms. Zuniga be returned to her classroom. The letter said: ""The Orange Public Schools website explains that part of your mission is that 'the district serves all students in our schools, acknowledging their unique backgrounds, cultural perspectives and learning styles.' This culturally relevant approach is consistent with the kind of teaching that Ms. Zuniga enacts and is part of the broader field of social justice education.""The educators also spoke of the importance of Ms. Zuniga's social justice work with young people outside the classroom: This work ""includes the coordination of 'A Books and Breakfast' monthly program that has provided over 200 free books and 360 healthy breakfasts for Newark youth and families. She also coaches a 'Girls on the Run' program at her school, which develops self-esteem and confidence for 3rd-5th grade girls.""Another group of prominent educators, including historians Robin D.G. Kelley and Barbara Ransby, in a letter organized by Educators for Mumia Abu-Jamal, said: ""Nearly all scholars of African American history see Abu-Jamal as belonging to the American literary canon that includes figures and writers like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Angela Davis, Ella Baker and Ida B. Wells.... Mumia Abu Jamal is legitimately hailed as the ""voice of the voiceless"" for black and Latino people and for many others in this country who work for what Cornel West has termed ""prophetic justice"" and ""radical love."""" At a time when the Black Lives Matter movement has brought to the forefront, and is organizing against, anti-Black violence and injustice; when our public education system is failing to meet the most basic educational needs of our students, particularly low income and students of color; when public school curricula has been dumbed-down and hijacked by high stakes testing and the corporatization of public education; when our schools are increasingly segregated and unequal; teachers like Marylin Zuniga should be celebrated, not chastised. Deeply committed to her students and to their learning, Ms. Zuniga not only deserves to be back in the classroom immediately, but her students deserve that as well. Our students' learning should not be determined by the Fraternal Order of Police or, in fact, by any outside forces with agendas that have nothing to do with our children's education or with equity and justice.  *The author is working with educators and community members in support of Marylin Zuniga. Her husband, civil rights lawyer Alan Levine, is representing Ms. Zuniga."

She picked up a bottle of Caterina de Medici by i Profumi di Firenze, dabbed it on her wrist and was smitten. The line, based on recipes commissioned by 16th century Queen of France Catherine de Medici, is crafted from the same ingredients used during the Renaissance. The fragrance collection came about with an amazing discovery. After the historic Florentine flood of 1966 a perfumer named Dr. Giovanni di Massimo found Catherine de Medici's secret perfume formulas in a Renaissance manuscript in a cubbyhole in the basement of his apothecary. Remarkably, the water from the flood hadn't touched it. Buried for centuries, the secrets of the Queen's perfume formulas remained in tact. Dr. di Massimo carefully recreated these Renaissance fragrances using only all natural ingredients and his exclusive methods of essence extraction. The collection of perfumes includes other Florentine classics originally commissioned for the Medici Family and blends known to have been popular among the Renaissance nobility.When she returned to her home in Santa Monica, California, Miryana couldn't forget the scents or their story. A few months later, she began importing the collection of perfumes launching them at Barneys New York stores and Fred Segal in Los Angeles. Today the i Profumi di Firenze collection encompasses over 30 fragrances of 16th century Renaissance formulas as well as modern minimal blends like spring and summer's best selling sea breeze fragrance, Brezza di Mare. Neroli Flor, one the newest additions to the collection, evokes Italian citrus groves on warm, sunny days.The most popular fragrance in the collection is Vaniglia del Madagascar. According to Miryana, customers are fanatics for it, buying multiple bottles for fear of running out. It has numerous celebrity fans and a customer from a royal family recently purchased 21 bottles to secure her supply. My favorite fragrance in the collection is Costa Mediterranea. Its soft, masculine scent is fresh and serene. The company describes it as evoking a ""holiday at the sea"" and the magnificence of the Mediterranean with notes of Sicilian Lemon, Calabrian Bergamot, Vetiver and Sicilian Orange.I Profumi di Firenze is available at C.O. Bigelow in New York, Fred Segal in Hollywood, Tigerlily Perfumery in San Francisco and online at Beautyhabit.com."

Abe urged new graduates of the academy to guard against 'provocations' amid simmering tensions with China over the sovereigniy of an island chain. AFP PHOTO / KAZUHIRO NOGI (Photo credit should read KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14a0d260000520070a803.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TOKYO -- On April 29, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will address a joint session of the United States Congress. The Japan-U.S. alliance is now 63 years old, but this will be the first time that a Japanese leader will be accorded this high honor from the American government and people.Abe's visit to the U.S. comes at a time when friction between the two countries is at an all-time low. The trade and economic disputes that incited tensions -- and a sub-genre of paranoid movies about Japan -- in the 1980s, when nine members of Congress even smashed a Toshiba radio with sledgehammers, rarely make an appearance nowadays.Those past disputes probably explain why former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, though a political soulmate of then-President Ronald Reagan, was never invited to address a joint session of Congress. Today, however, the bilateral relationship is very different. Japan's economic interests are more closely aligned with America's -- the country is poised to join the U.S.-initiated Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will create a vast free-trade zone among a dozen Pacific Rim countries -- and the two sides' strategic visions for Asia are in near-harmony.Moreover, the long-simmering dispute over the U.S. Marine Corps base on Okinawa, which had roiled bilateral relations during the years the Democratic Party of Japan was in power, has been settled amicably, with the U.S. agreeing to move the base to a less populated part of the island. Of course, some Okinawa residents remain opposed to the U.S. base's continued presence on their island, but most Japanese recognize the need for this tangible symbol of their alliance with America, which remains the bedrock of Japan's national security strategy.The two sides' increasingly similar views on international security issues as well, particularly where China is concerned, no doubt also contributed to the decision by the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama's administration to honor Abe. Both Abe and Obama are focused on creating a durable structure of peace for all of Asia, and Abe has been eager for Japan to play a more active role in this regard, and in supporting its allies. That stance is making the alliance much more a partnership of equals than it has been for the last six decades.In America's view, the reinterpretation of Article 9 of Japan's ""peace constitution"" that Abe undertook -- thereby allowing Japan's self-defense forces to aid allies under attack and to assist the U.S. and other allies in meeting their commitments to securing Asia's peace -- was long overdue. That bold policy initiative -- in the face of the Japanese public's deeply ingrained skepticism toward any increased exposure to military risks -- has no doubt endeared Abe to U.S. diplomats and military strategists, as well as secured both open and sometimes tacit approval from Japan's Asian neighbors.Increased military cooperation with the U.S. is particularly important now, given American worries about many of its other strategic partners' readiness. Even the United Kingdom, long seen as America's closest ally, now seems intent on undermining its ability to work cooperatively with the U.S. in times of crisis, even in meeting its NATO commitments, because of severe cuts to its military budget. Other allies are also increasingly regarded in the U.S. as free riders on America's military might.Abe's commitment to the rules and institutions of the post-1945 world order, which helped bring Japan out of the ruins of World War II and has allowed China to rise so peacefully, gives the U.S. another reason to honor him. Like the U.S., Japan has many concerns about the parallel institutions -- including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the BRICS countries' New Development Bank -- that China is creating.Having benefited so much from the post-war global order, most Japanese share Abe's view that China's efforts to replace it with one more to its liking is both unwise and dangerous for Asia. Indeed, countries that have decided to cooperate with China in creating rival multilateral institutions should ask themselves a simple question: Would a world order designed by China allow for the rise of another power to challenge it in the way the U.S.-led world order allowed for -- indeed, encouraged and assisted -- China's three-decade-long boom?To answer that question, one can look to the writings of the Chinese strategist Yan Xuetong, whose book ""Ancient Chinese Thought, Modern Chinese Power"" argues that all countries must recognize and accept China's centrality to the world as the Middle Kingdom. Moreover, China has thus far shown little interest in discussing the standards by which the multilateral institutions it has launched will be governed -- or, indeed, the extent to which they will be truly multilateral.Abe's visit to the U.S. thus comes at a moment of clarity in bilateral relations. Both countries seek to create a viable structure of peace for Asia, one that allows China to continue to grow and prosper, but that prevents any one country from claiming hegemony. And both favor a rules-based Asian trading order that reinforces the global norms that have served the world so well since WWII's end. In honoring Abe with an address to Congress, the U.S. is really honoring the values and vision that both countries share.© Project Syndicate "

And in a 2010 interview with David Gregory on Meet the Press, Petraeus said of whistleblower Chelsea Manning's leaking of classified war documents to WikiLeaks, ""This is beyond unfortunate. I mean, this is a betrayal of trust."" Kiriakou, after serving twenty-three months in prison, is currently finishing his three-month house arrest, and Manning is serving her thirty-five-year prison sentence.Meanwhile, in March Petraeus agreed to a lenient plea deal which will likely only result in two years' probation and a $40,000 fine for giving classified information to his mistress and authorized biographer Paula Broadwell. He also has, as the New York Times' Matt Apuzzo writes, ""a lucrative post-government career"" as a partner in a private equity firm. Not only does Petraeus go on speaking tours about national security, but he has also continued to advise the Obama administration on its strategy in Iraq. This stark difference in the way government officials are prosecuted and treated after leaking classified information reveals a double standard for leaks: serious criminal consequences are brought on only those who expose government wrongdoing.High-level government officials like Petraeus are immune from these consequences because the information they reveal is in the government's interest. By contrast, low-level employees (like Kiriakou, Manning and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden) who reveal government corruption, abuse and wrongdoing are prosecuted to the fullest extent because the government wants this information kept secret, and because these low-level employees don't have the political resources and connections to fight back. The government uses these prosecutions as a method of deterrence for future whistleblowing, giving the message that if you leak classified information that makes the government look bad, you will spend time in prison. (Luckily for the public, this threat didn't deter Snowden: since the day he went public via the Guardian, he has said numerous times that he is willing to face any consequences provided that he is guaranteed a fair trial.)Government officials leak classified information without authorization to journalists all the time. But this information makes the administration look good. It details successful military operations overseas or productive discussions with foreign governments. For example, the Obama administration has been accused of intentionally inviting a filmmaker of Zero Dark Thirty, a film spewing U.S. war propaganda, to a talk by former CIA director Leon Panetta who disclosed classified information. Panetta was never prosecuted.Neither was James Cartwright, a retired Marine general who gave highly classified information to a Times reporter about a joint U.S.-Israeli effort to cripple Iran's nuclear centrifuges through a cyber attack. The information he leaked is not very different from that leaked by Jeffrey Sterling, an African American CIA officer convicted in January for leaking classified information to Pulitzer Prize-winning Times reporter James Risen about a CIA effort to undermine Iran's nuclear program. In March, Sterling's lawyers requested a reconsideration of his conviction considering the lenient treatment given to both Petraeus and Cartwright. ""The principal difference between Mr. Sterling and Generals Petraeus and Cartwright are their respective races and rank,"" Sterling's lawyers argue. ""Like General Cartwright, General Petraeus is a white, high ranking official [...] The government must explain why the justice meted out to white generals is so different from what Mr. Sterling faced?As investigative journalist and Intercept co-founder Jeremy Scahill said at the paperback launch of his book Dirty Wars, ""[current CIA director] John Brennan leaked so much after the Osama bin Laden raid that I wanted to buy him a Depends diaper."" Every detail leaked to the press by Brennan about the bin Laden raid turned out to be false. He revealed them to make the story more jingoistic, to make the military look good. But he was never prosecuted or held accountable for leaking this classified - albeit false - information.There is another important difference in how the double standard works: unlike Petraeus and Cartwright, low-level whistleblowers get charged with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. The Justice Department under President Obama has used the Espionage Act seven times (Thomas Drake, Shamai Leibowitz, Manning, Stephen Kim, Sterling, Kiriakou and Snowden) in leak prosecutions - more than double the three times that all prior administrations combined have used it. Violating the Espionage Act is a strict liability offense, which means that you can't mount a defense, so a court cannot consider a person's intent for leaking classified information. As Jesselyn Radack, a lawyer for Snowden, Kiriakou and Drake, said on Democracy Now!, ""It does not matter whether you were leaking secrets to a foreign enemy for profit or whether you were giving information to journalists in the public interest to give back to the people who have a right to know what's been done in their name.""No one in government raises an eyebrow when propagandist information is leaked to the media. This is exactly the information that the government wants the public to know. In this environment of state-sponsored journalism wherein the only information leaked to the public is that which the government authorizes the public to know, we as members of the public must demand transparency and accountability. This is why independent journalism - which should be inherently adversarial to the state - is so utterly necessary. It serves as the only challenge to the government's line. Otherwise, high-level officials like David Petraeus are free to profit from selling propaganda (""The hard-earned progress of the Surge was sustained for over three years"") and lies about the U.S. government while Chelsea Manning faces three decades in prison for exposing the wrongdoing that people like Petraeus wish to keep secret from the public."

Today, he seemed fine. I told him that he'd be going back to school tomorrow, and instantly his symptoms reappeared. ""I'm hot. My forehead is warm. My hands are cold,"" and then the fake cough started up.I pulled him aside, then got down to his level, ""Is there some other reason you don't want to go to school tomorrow?""""No."" I could tell the question made him uneasy. He averted my gaze and shrugged his shoulders in. ""I just don't want to go."" He squeaked out.""Is everything going okay there? Do you like your teacher?"" ""Yeah.""""Are the other kids nice?"" Bingo. He stalled response, and I could see the flicker of thought suddenly appear in his eyes. He was debating saying anything. I reached out and grabbed his little hand. ""Well, they are nice in class... most of the time, but not most of the time at recess. They say mean things."" He blurted out, as soon as he said it, his eyes darted up and he locked gaze. I could tell this was serious.""They say mean things to you?""""Yeah. Well, I mean sometimes they say it to other kids, and then I just hear them talking about me.""I gripped his hand tighter and he looked back down at the floor. ""What kind of stuff do they say?""""I don't know.""""You don't know, or you don't want to talk about it?""""I don't know.""""Okay. Well, who says the mean things?""""I don't know."" I could tell he was starting to clam up. He started shifting uncomfortably. ""Okay. You know, I'm not saying it to get anyone in trouble. I just want to know how I can help.""""I know."" ""When they are mean, do you tell a teacher?"" I ask, and he glanced up and locked gaze again. His little blue eyes expressed urgency.""I do when we're in class but it's at recess.""""Is there a playground supervisor you can tell?""""Yeah.""""Does it help when you tell them?""He didn't say a word, his shoulders sunk lower.  ""Okay.""After a long pause, his little voice whispers, ""Mom?""""Yeah?""""Can I tell you what some of the grown-ups do at my school?"" My mind started going a million different directions. What the hell is going on at this school? Are adults hurting my child? ""Yeah, what do they do?""All of the sudden he perked up, his tone shifted and he started talking faster, ""Well, parents, other moms and dads sometimes come to the school. To help out. And they stay on the playground with them."" ""You mean, the parents that come volunteer for the playground?""""Yeah."" The realization of what he was saying stung. I have been pretty absent from school this year. Point taken, little guy.""Would you like me to come to your school and help on the playground sometime?""He dove into me with his entire body and started crying. I scooped him up and he folded into my lap like he did when he was a baby, eight years ago. We sat on the edge of the bed, saying nothing, tears down both of our faces and rocked."
