# dissertation 2022

Github Repo for my Master's dissertation for 2021-2022. I don't know why this idea did not come into my brain earlier. Mainly things to do is to read the papers, summarise them, get the data, run the word2visualvec on it, get the similarity scores. If I get down to it, it should really not take longer than like 2 weeks. So now try to get down to it. And in the middle for break you can watch a little bit.
